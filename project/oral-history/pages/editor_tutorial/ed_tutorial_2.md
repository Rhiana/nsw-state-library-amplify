# Transcription Conventions

There are many ways to transcribe an oral history, so if you're unsure, we have one general guideline: **Transcribe as you hear it.**

Use your best judgment to **transcribe it as you hear it**. For common tricky transcriptions, we also have a list of **"Conventions"** handy. Quickly access this reference in the toolbar in the top right side of this page.
