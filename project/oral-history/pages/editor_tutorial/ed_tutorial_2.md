# Transcription Conventions

There are many ways to transcribe an oral history, so if you're unsure, we have one general guideline: **Transcribe as you hear it.**

If an interviewer uses an abbreviation or a contraction, include those as you hear them. Examples: _shoulda_, _couldn't_

Numbers should be transcribed as numerals. Examples: _1 West 40th Street_, _She was 40 years old_

Noises should be transcribed in brackets. Use descriptive language when transcribing noises (e.g. _And then we [door slam]_, _So cold! [Brrrrr]_)

We also have a handy **"Cheat Sheet"** which has guidelines for many tricky transcriptions which you can access in the toolbar in the top right side of this page
