# Verify

<span class="reviewing">Lines highlighted in orange</span> await verification. These are lines where contributors disagreed on how to transcribe. To verify, click on the line and select the best transcription from those presented or flag that none of these transcriptions are correct.

<!--video below should demonstrate verify-->

Once enough contributors agree on the correct transcription, the line will be finalized. Project admins will be alerted when line is flagged as having no correct transcription.
