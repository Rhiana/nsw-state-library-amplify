#Editing Transcripts

The following transcript was generated using speech-to-text software, so there are probably errors. This tool will allow you to listen while you edit the transcript. <span class="highlight">All your edits will be automatically saved</span> but may not be immediately visible by others.

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="680" height="398" loop autoplay src="/project/oral-history/assets/img/transcribe-edit.mp4" alt="Screenshot of a transcript being edited."></video>
</div>

The audio will automatically pause after each line.
