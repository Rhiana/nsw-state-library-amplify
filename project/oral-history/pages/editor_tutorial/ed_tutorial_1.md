# Welcome!

The following transcript you are about to read was generated using speech-to-text software, so there are probably errors. This tool will allow you to listen to the oral history while you edit its transcript.

You will listen to one line at a time (the audio will automatically pause for you), which will last about 4 to 7 seconds each. Simply edit the text to match what you here.

<!-- <div class="video-wrapper">
  <video loop autoplay src="/project/assets/img/transcribe-edit.mp4" alt="Screenshot of a transcript being edited."></video>
</div> -->

<span class="highlight">All your edits will be automatically saved</span> but may not be immediately visible by others. Once enough editors agree on a corrected transcript line, we'll lock that line for editing and have it displayed in our official transcripts.  You may log in using a Google account to keep track of all your edits.
