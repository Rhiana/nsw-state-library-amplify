# Speaker Identification

There are typically two or more speakers in each oral history. For each line, note the speaker using the speaker identification button to the left of each line. **You only need to do this when a speaker changes**.

<!--video below should be of someone choosing speaker id for multiple speakers-->

For lines with multiple speakers, select the final "multiple speakers" option.
