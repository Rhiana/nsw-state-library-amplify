## OUR GOAL

Edit and polish computer-generated transcripts of the [New York Public Library's Community Oral History Project](oralhistory.nypl.org). This community driven project will make accessible over 1,000 stories of New York City's past and present.


### EDITS
We start by loading computer-generated transcripts into the online tool and asking you to edit the errors found in the computer-generated transcript. Edit as you hear and use your best judgement. We've included some conventions and FAQs for reference while correcting.

After multiple people have corrected the transcript. The edits are compared. If the edited lines correspond, the tool calculates the most correct line, marks it as final, and locks it for future edits. (The best line is calculated by comparing the use of punctuation, capitalization, and numerals.)  


### VERIFY  

If consensus on a transcribed line is not automatically reached, lines go into review mode where users vote on the most correct version of the line.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  

**Do I need to be logged in to contribute?**
No! Anyone can contribute at anytime without logging in. If you do chose to log in, you’ll be able to see all the edits you’ve made when you return the next time. This can be useful if you’re working on a long transcript and would like to return to it later. Your work is always automatically saved regardless of whether or not you’re logged in.

**I want to leave the page how do I save my work?**  
All your work is automatically saved. When you come to a stopping point, you don’t need to do anything extra to save your work!

**What happens if I make a mistake?**  
Don't worry! Edit the transcription as best you can from what you hear. The consensus model will ensure that the line is accurate.

**I don't know how to spell a word or think I misheard, what do I do?**  
If you're unsure you can precede a word with a question mark to signify that you're unsure. For examples of these and other conventions, refer to the tools conventions.

**What happens if the line is correct and we don't need to make any edits?**  
Sometimes the speech-to-text hits it out of the park and transcribes a line perfectly. In that case, no edits are needed. When enough volunteers pass over a line without editing it, the line will reach consensus in the same manner as edited lines.

**Do I need to come to the Library to contribute to Together We Listen?**  
Contribute whenever and wherever suits you best! This is an on-line project and you can participate with a desktop and an internet connection. In the Spring of 2016, we’ll be holding some public sessions for working on the tool, more information can be found on [NYPL.org](nypl.org)

**Can I use the tool on my phone?**  
Currently the tool is configured for use on a desktop.

**How long will it take to transcribe**  


**Can I edit my own audio?**  
The Open Transcript Tool code-base for this tool is open source software. Developers can visit the [Github Repo](https://github.com/NYPL/transcript-editor) to get started setting up their own instance of the tool.
