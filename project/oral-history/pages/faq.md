# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  
_Updated: March 30, 2016_

**Do I need to be logged in to contribute?**  
No! Anyone can contribute at anytime without logging in. If you do chose to log in, you’ll be able to see all the edits you’ve made when you return the next time. This can be useful if you’re working on a long transcript and would like to return to it later. Your work is always automatically saved regardless of whether or not you’re logged in.

**When should I log in?**  
It's best to log in at the start of your editing session. This will help ensure that all your work is counted towards your overall progress.  

**I want to leave the page how do I save my work?**  
All your work is automatically saved. When you come to a stopping point, you don’t need to do anything extra to save your work!  

**Why are their different progress a**  
This is a community effort. We display total progress made by the community in the transcript. Since we require several people to edit each transcript, the overall progress will appear less than your individual progress. Log in at the "Track Progress" to keep track of your individual progress through interviews.  

**What happens if I make a mistake?**  
Don't worry! Edit the transcription as best you can from what you hear. The consensus model will ensure that the line is accurate.  
**The audio repeats on two lines. Which line should I transcribe it on?**  
Because of how the audio is feeding into the tool, sometimes a word may be spoken at the end of one line and the start of the following. For these cases, listen closely. If a word is cut off on one line, transcribe it on the line where you can hear it completely. If a word is spoken in it's entirety on two lines, use your best judgment to transcribe it on just one line. Remember these tricky transcriptions will be smoothed out during the verify stage.  

**I don't know how to spell a word or think I misheard, what do I do?**  
If you're unsure you can precede a word with a question mark to signify that you're unsure. For examples of these and other conventions, refer to the tools conventions.  

**What happens if the line is correct and we don't need to make any edits?**  
Sometimes the speech-to-text hits it out of the park and transcribes a line perfectly. In that case, no edits are needed. When enough volunteers pass over a line without editing it, the line will reach consensus in the same manner as edited lines.

**Where can I see the completed transcripts?**  
We're working to publish the completed transcripts on the [Oral History Website](oralhistory.nypl.org).  

**Do I need to come to the Library to contribute to Together We Listen?**  
Contribute whenever and wherever suits you best! This is an on-line project and you can participate with a desktop and an internet connection. In the Spring of 2016, we’ll be holding some public sessions for working on the tool, more information can be found on [NYPL.org](http://www.nypl.org/events/calendar?keyword=&location=&type=&topic=&audience=&series=342176&date_op=GREATER_EQUAL&date1=03%2F21%2F2016)

**Can I use the tool on my phone?**  
Currently the tool is configured for use on a desktop.

**How long will it take to transcribe**  
You can transcribe for a few seconds or a few hours. You can log in to keep track of your progress. Transcript editing may take several times the length of the corresponding audio.

**Can I delete and/or create a new line in the transcript?**  
No. Transcript lines are synced with clips of audio. Some audio clips are empty; rather than delete an empty line leave it as is. Some lines contain multiple people speaking, mark these as such with the speaker identification functionality.

**Several people are speaking in one line. What should I do?**  
Transcribe the audio as you hear it. Tag the line as having multiple speakers.    

**Can I edit my own audio?**  
The Open Transcript Tool code-base for this tool is open source software. Developers can visit the [Github Repo](https://github.com/NYPL/transcript-editor) to get started setting up their own instance of the tool.
