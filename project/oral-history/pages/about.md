# Intro

Today thousands of libraries and public media organizations publish large digital audio collections online. Most of these, however, lack transcripts or basic metadata, rendering them invisible to search engines and impenetrable to prospective users. Recent advances in speech-to-text technologies have made great progress in opening audio to the web, but lack total accuracy, keywords, and qualitative, topic-based description.

[The New York Public Library (NYPL)](http://nypl.org/) and [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) — both curators of rich and ongoing personal storytelling archives — propose to combine the innovative auto-transcription services of [Pop Up Archive](https://popuparchive.com/) with a community engagement model focused on correcting and enriching transcripts in collaboration with the public.

Audio will be transcribed using Pop Up Archive’s software and then presented to communities in an interactive editor developed by [NYPL Labs](http://www.nypl.org/collections/labs). The Moth will engage its online listener base to edit transcripts of over 800 recorded stage stories; NYPL will build an in-person participation model at its branch libraries to work on 1,000+ stories from its ongoing [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/).

# Tool

This tool will allow you to listen to the oral history while you edit its transcript. The  transcript was <b>computer generated</b> using speech-to-text software and <b>it will contain errors</b>.

You will listen to the audio one line at a time (the audio will automatically pause for you). Select the first line and to start editing the transcript directly in the browser. The tool bar at the top of the page displays shortcuts for navigating the tool.

There are transcription conventions for reference. <span class="highlight">All your edits will be automatically saved.</span> Once enough editors agree on a corrected transcript line, we'll lock that line for editing and have it displayed in our official transcripts.

You may log in using a Google account to keep track of all your edits. <a href="http://twl-nypl.herokuapp.com/">Browse the Oral Histories</a> and select one to get started.

# How Does It Work  

1. A community member records and Oral History or Memory Circle, typically with a zoom recorder or a smart phone app.  
2. The Library processes the story and now has an audio file and some basic metadata.  
3. We send the audio file to Pop Up Archive  
    [Pop Up Archive](https://www.popuparchive.com/about) timestamps the audio file into lines of about 6 seconds and generates transcript text using speech to text technologies. The computer-generated transcripts are synced with the audio timestamps.
4. NYPL loads the audio and transcripts into the Transcript Corrector Tool.
5. YOU listen and make your edits to the transcript, correcting it.
6. After five people have listened, the tool compares the edits.
7. If at least three people agree on the corrected text, the tool calculates the most correct line and it is locked. (The best line is calculated by comparing the use of punctuation, capitalization, and numerals.)
8. If no consensus is reached, a line goes into review mode where users vote on the most correct version of the line.

<!--# Frequently Asked Questions
#### Why Pop Up Archive?

#### Can I edit my own recording?
This project is based on the Open Transcript Tool, an open source code base available on Github. Anyone can pick up this codebase and create their own instance of the tool.

# Data

By editing transcripts, you're helping to create accurate transcripts helping to share 1,000+ stories from the ongoing [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/). These transcripts improve accessibility options for patrons browsing the collected stories and provide material for future tools to create rich data sets. How? Take for example the interview of Frank Senior.
<div><img src="/project/assets/img/transcript_data_1.png" alt="Screenshot of a transcript expert from Frank Senior's Oral History."></div>
Once we have an accurate transcript. Someone could take the transcript and extract geographic information from the story.
<div><img src="/project/assets/img/transcript_data_2.png" alt="Screenshot of a transcript expert from Frank Senior's Oral History."></div>
That data could then be plotted on a map. A new way to interact with Senior's story and a new way of narratively mapping the city.
