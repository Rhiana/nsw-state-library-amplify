# Our Goal  
**Hello and welcome** to the NYPL Community Oral History Project Transcript Editor. Join us in editing and polishing computer-generated transcripts of the [New York Public Library's Community Oral History Project](oralhistory.nypl.org). This community driven project will make accessible over 1,000+ stories of New York City's past and present.

# The Problem: Unsearchable, Inaccessible Audio

Today thousands of libraries and public media organizations publish large digital audio collections online. Most of these, however, lack transcripts or basic metadata, leaving them invisible to search engines and inaccessible to prospective users. Recent advances in speech-to-text technologies have made great progress in opening audio to the web, but they lack total accuracy and there’s still more to be done. With generous support from the Knight Foundation, [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) and [The New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/) started a joint grant funded project—[Together We Listen](http://togetherwelisten.nypl.org/)—to start solving this problem.

# The Solution: You!

This is a community effort. In order for audio to be made more accurately searchable, people and computers need to work together! We’ve created transcripts of over 1,000+ stories in our ongoing Community Oral History Project using the amazing computer generated transcription services of [Pop Up Archive](https://popuparchive.com/). Now, we’re inviting the public to correct these and make them more accessible for current and future generations of users. Yes, this is where **YOU** come in!

## Start Contributing:

NYPL Community Oral History Project Transcript Editor will allow you to listen to the oral history while you edit its transcript. Each transcript was computer generated using speech-to-text software and **will contain errors** (which is why we need your help!).

Sound good? [Browse the Oral Histories](http://twl-nypl.herokuapp.com/) and select one to get started. An in-depth tutorial will guide you through the process with easy to reference FAQs and conventions.

## Live in NYC?
To continue the community-built tradition of the Oral History Project, transcription events will take place in the communities where oral histories are currently or were recently collected.

# About Our Community Oral History Project
Since 2013, The New York Public Library has been running the [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org). This NYC initiative aims to document, preserve, and celebrate the rich history of the city's unique neighborhoods by collecting the stories of people who have experienced it firsthand. To date, more than one thousand stories have been collected by community volunteers, and all recordings are available currently at [oralhistory.nypl.org](oralhistory.nypl.org), and will be archived in the Library's [Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy](http://www.nypl.org/locations/divisions/milstein) research collection.

# What Happens After A Transcript is Complete?
<!--Should this be on the OH About page?-->
By editing transcripts, you're helping to create accurate transcripts helping to share 1,000+ stories from the ongoing [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/). These transcripts improve accessibility options for patrons browsing the collected stories and provide material for future tools to create rich data sets. How? Take for example the interview of Frank Senior.

Once we have an accurate transcript. Someone could take the transcript and extract geographic information from the story.

That data could then be plotted on a map. A new way to interact with Senior's story and a new way of narratively mapping the city.
