# Introduction

Today thousands of libraries and public media organizations publish large digital audio collections online. Most of these, however, lack transcripts or basic metadata, rendering them invisible to search engines and impenetrable to prospective users. Recent advances in speech-to-text technologies have made great progress in opening audio to the web, but lack total accuracy, keywords, and qualitative, topic-based description.

[The New York Public Library (NYPL)](http://nypl.org/) and [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) — both curators of rich and ongoing personal storytelling archives — propose to combine the innovative auto-transcription services of [Pop Up Archive](https://popuparchive.com/) with a community engagement model focused on correcting and enriching transcripts in collaboration with the public.

Audio will be transcribed using Pop Up Archive’s software and then presented to communities in an interactive editor developed by [NYPL Labs](http://www.nypl.org/collections/labs). The Moth will engage its online listener base to edit transcripts of over 800 recorded stage stories; NYPL will build an in-person participation model at its branch libraries to work on 1,000+ hours of audio from its ongoing [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/).

The prototyping period will culminate in a public hackathon and oral storytelling celebration where participants can explore the enriched data sets and create new tools for discovery, analysis, and education.
