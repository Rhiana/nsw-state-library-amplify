# Our Goal  
**Hello and welcome** to the NYPL Community Oral History Project Transcript Editor. Join us in editing and polishing computer-generated transcripts of the [New York Public Library's Community Oral History Project](oralhistory.nypl.org). This community driven project will make accessible over 1,000 stories of New York City's past and present.

# The Problem: Unsearchable, Inaccessible Audio

Today thousands of libraries and public media organizations publish large digital audio collections online. Most of these, however, lack transcripts or basic metadata, leaving them invisible to search engines and inaccessible to prospective users. Recent advances in speech-to-text technologies have made great progress in opening audio to the web, but the transcripts they produce are still error-prone and require careful human editing to reach full accuracy. Transcripts are important because they make audio content searchable online, and accessible to people with hearing disabilities.

 We launched [Together We Listen](http://togetherwelisten.nypl.org/) a project in partnership with [The Moth](http://themoth.org/), with generous support from the [Knight Prototype Fund](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201551666/), to explore an approach to solving this problem.


# The Solution? You.

This is a community effort. In order for audio to be made more accurately searchable, people and computers need to work together! We’ve created transcripts of over 1,000 stories in our ongoing Community Oral History Project using the amazing computer generated transcription services of [Pop Up Archive](https://popuparchive.com/). Now, we’re inviting the public to correct these and make them more accessible for current and future generations of users. Yes, this is where **YOU** come in!

# Pitch In!

NYPL Community Oral History Project Transcript Editor will allow you to listen to an oral history while you edit its transcript. Each transcript was computer generated using speech-to-text software and **will contain errors** (which is why we need your help!).

Sound good? [Browse the Oral Histories](http://twl-nypl.herokuapp.com/) and select one to get started. An in-depth tutorial will guide you through the process with easy to reference FAQs and conventions.

# About Our Community Oral History Project
Since 2013, The New York Public Library has been running the [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org). This NYC initiative aims to document, preserve, and celebrate the rich history of the city's unique neighborhoods by collecting the stories of people who have experienced it firsthand. To date, more than one thousand stories have been collected by community volunteers, and all recordings are available currently at [oralhistory.nypl.org](oralhistory.nypl.org), and will be archived in the Library's [Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy](http://www.nypl.org/locations/divisions/milstein) research collection.

# What Happens After A Transcript is Complete?
By editing transcripts, you're helping to create accurate transcripts helping to share over 1,000 stories from the ongoing [Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/). These transcripts improve accessibility options for patrons browsing the collected stories and provide material for future tools to create rich data sets. Once they have been edited with agreement from enough contributors, completed transcripts will be available to read and download at [oralhistory.nypl.org](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/), along with the audio recordings. Stay tuned!
