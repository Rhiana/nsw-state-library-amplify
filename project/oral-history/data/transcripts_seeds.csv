lois-fermaglich-8ixlnz,Lois Gelber Fermaglich,"Lois Gelber Fermaglich often returns to her old neighborhood in the Bronx. And she wonders why that borough hasn't yet experienced a renaissance, as Brooklyn has. Her experiences growing up near Pelham Parkway evoke only good memories. And she's sure that the Bronx can offer similar experiences again to an influx of new residents. Beautiful parks, close-knit neighbors and a wide selection of places where one can enjoy a variety of ethnic foods are all still there -- if only people would venture north of Manhattan. Lois brings to life the daily routines she so vividly remembers and shares her sense of wonder as she ventured beyond her neighborhood's boundaries -- to junior high school in Parkchester, to the west Bronx to attend Hunter College, to medical school in Kentucky. But always, her heart is in the Bronx, where the sound of an elevated subway evokes memories of waking each morning in her childhood home on Kruger Avenue.

allen-and-pat-harris-ait3vd,Allan and Pat Harris,"Allan Harris has been living in Harlem since the 1950s. He remembers when the area was a safe haven for black people during segregation. The neighborhood was also a cultural hub that enriched him as a kid. During the Harlem Renaissance, artists, writers, and musicians gave Harlem its identity and its reputation. However, in the 1970s, the neighborhood was infested with drugs, and Harlem was considered dangerous. Then Harlem rose from its ashes again. Pat Harris remembers how welcoming people in Harlem were when she moved there. Despite the current gentrification, Harlem remains a special neighborhood and is still “a melting pot.” (Summary Written By: Anonymous)",http://oralhistory.nypl.org/interviews/allen-and-pat-harris-ait3vd,https://s3.amazonaws.com/oral-history/audio/Allan+Harris+4-22-2014.mp3,https://oral-history.s3.amazonaws.com/images/interview/image/90/thumb_IMG_1228.JPG,harlem,pop_up_archive,51588,Interviewed by Henry Blaukopf
douglas-payne-24frep,Douglas Payne,"Douglas Payne is a retired musician from Harlem. He shares his deep insight and passion for the local music culture as he lived it. Dougie is a prodigiously talented multi-instrumentalist and virtuoso and has been involved in music for most of his life. During the 1980s, following his military service, he was at the heart of the funk and hip hop scenes, where he worked with such seminal figures as Rick James, Melle Mel and Frankie Crocker. His struggles with racism, poverty, and disability deeply color his experience. His musical success was regularly punctuated by homelessness and his struggles to receive his due benefits as a veteran. Outside of his work in music, Dougie is also deeply involved in Harlem at a wider community level as a teacher and, politically, through organizations like the Congress of Racial Equality (C.O.R.E.) and through the influence of such figures as Congressman Charlie Rangel. Dougie relates his music to the wider social issues of his experience, such as education, violence and aging. (Summary Written By: Danielle H.

kathy-bristow-g6uztv,Cathy Bristow,"Cathy Bristow initially moved to Harlem to move into a safehouse, in order to escape an abusive relationship. She eventually moved into an apartment in the neighborhood (where she still lives) and recalls spending much of her time there in her first few years looking for places where she felt safe, such as neighborhood restaurants, and parts of Central Park nearest to the obvious undercover cops. Alongside a very successful corporate career, Cathy has dedicated much of her life to trying to make Harlem, and the City as a whole, a better, safer, and more welcoming place for all kinds of people. In the interview, she discusses, among other things, mentoring people from the local Y, leading meetings in her home to talk about race, and throwing an engagement party for a gay couple with unsupportive parents.

christel-ellis-p5x5er,Christel Ellis,"Librarian Christal Ellis recalls, in vivid detail, the Harlem of her youth. From the Mom & Pop stores of the 1970s and '80s, to today's chain stores, Christal compares Harlem as it once was to what it is in 2015. Eating chicken and waffles at Copeland's, buying ice cream from Mr. Softee, having her hair done at Rose Morgan's beauty parlor, seeing movies at the Victoria Movie Theater, and buying baked goods from Make My Cake -- all come to life as she reminisces. All was not perfect, however, as she also remembers the ""crack era"" and its negative impact on her neighborhood, as well as incidents of police brutality. Christal is optimistic about Harlem's future and hopes that, as it undergoes its resurgence, it can also ""hold on to the essence of what Harlem was.""

frank-morales-hzp44y,Frank Morales,"Frank Morales is a priest and long-time community organizer from the Lower East Side. In the early 1980s, Frank became involved with the workers' center Harlem Fight Back, at 125th Street, where he met Jim Haughton. He and Mr. Haughton organized the community around housing issues through the Harlem Reclamation Project, which fought to combat the displacement of poor communities of color through direct action. The displacement of poor communities was a widespread activity and part of what city housing officials called the ""planned shrinkage"" of the Harllem neighborhood. Frank returned to Harlem to serve at All Souls Episcopal Church on 114th Street, which he says strives to ""bridge"" new and old communities in south Harlem in solidarity. He reflects on his experience in the throes of change in Harlem over the decades. (Summary Written By: Danielle H.

grace-ambelas-and-william-hinton-1jbsc5,Grace Ambelas and William Hinton,"Grace Ambelas and William Hinton describe their childhood in Staten Island starting in the 1950s. They recall a safe and welcoming neighborhood where different people cohabited. There was a sense of trust and solidarity among neighbors. Back then, kids would be sent to buy small items in shops and there they would do small jobs to earn some money for sweets. Therefore, the small businesses were some of their favorite haunts. They also recall their favorite improvised playgrounds around the neighborhood. Finally, the library was an important landmark for Grace and she describes her experience there.

octavio-felicie-1owahn,Octavio Felicie,"The Inwood to which Octavio Felicie moved in 1968 was very different from the Inwood of today. He recalls facing discrimination and racial confrontations in the then mostly Irish neighborhood. Inwood’s Hispanic population grew rapidly during Octavio’s early days there, and this growth was accompanied by an increasing number of Hispanic nightclubs featuring such performers as Tito Puente and Ray Barretto. Octavio laments what he saw as a rise in drug-usage and crime in Inwood, but he also believes this has dropped since the 1990s. Despite all the change, Octavio maintains that he has always felt more at home in Inwood than in his native Puerto Rico.

miriam-mejia-lp8aij,Miriam Mejia,"Since her childhood in the Dominican Republic, Miriam Mejia hasbeen interested in social justice. Her relentless political activism during her college years earned her a reputation as a ""hot head."" Even after moving to the United States with two small children, her commitment to social justice continued. Today, she is associated with numerous causes in her Washington Heights neighborhood. Among other things, she discusses the importance of feminism in her life and her involvement in protests against police brutality in her neighborhood. Her story is a story of trying to help a community empower itself -- and find its own voice.

andrea-arroyo-gt6isa,Andrea Arroyo,"Though born in Mexico, Andrea Arroyo has spent much of her life in New York City, living in several different neighborhoods, including the East Village, the Upper West Side and, most recently, Washington Heights. She is an accomplished artist whose works, dealing primarily with women's issues, have been displayed in many different galleries and in less traditional venues for art, such as Washington Heights' Morris-Jumel Mansion. Andrea discusses some of the things she loves about Washington Heights, including its historical sites, its wide open spaces and parkland, and access to an abundance of fresh produce.

Oral History Project – NYPL – for Inwood-Washington Heights, NY


Notes on Geographic issues in uptown Manhattan:

Postal (later ZIP) codes for northern Manhattan were created and set up in numerical sequence:  10032, 10033 and 10040.

In the early 1960s, four 24-story residential apartment houses were built on the slopes of Ft. George Hill:
	99 Hillside Avenue – opened in 1960 – Inwood Terrace Inc.
	17 Ft. George Hill – opened in 1961 – Inwood Heights Inc.
	11 Ft. George Hill – opened in 1963 – Inwood Tower Inc.
	45 Fairview Avenue – opened in 1963 – Inwood Gardens Inc.

Each house became fully occupied within a short time after opening; waiting lists for apartments were extensive and many families who wished to move into one of these buildings were not able to do so.

At the time that these buildings were occupied, it was determined that the Post Office on Vermilyea Avenue, 10034, would not be able to handle the volume of mail.  Therefore, a new Post Office was created, 10040, and carved out to cover the 4 new buildings, a section of Washington Heights west of Broadway, from ~187th Street to the Hudson River, to the junction of Nagle Avenue, Bennett Avenue and Broadway.  In addition, the ‘triangular’ area bounded by Hillside-Nagle Avenues, Broadway and Dyckman Street was included in the new “Fort George” ZIP Code, 10040.  A new P.O. building was built, also in the red brick used for the four Fort George Inwood properties’ buildings, at the SE corner of Broadway and 196th Street-Hillside Avenue.

Over time, living conditions in Inwood varied, often on a block-by-block basis.  Even on a two-block street, the caliber of the housing stock, overall maintenance of facilities, safety issues, sanitary conditions and street noise, would vary dramatically.

Generally speaking, all areas west of Broadway were more stable and better areas than those east of Broadway.  In particular, the area bounded by 179th Street on the south, Broadway on the east, the Hudson River on the west and Ft. Tryon Park on the north was known to be the safest section in uptown Manhattan and had the least turnover of long-time residents.


Security matters in northern Manhattan –

In the 1980s, as quality of life issues became more pressing and long-time residents’ concerns were less and less addressed due to the increase in serious crime, these developments were noticed by the interviewee:

•	A localized ambulance and emergency care corps was created, called Hatzoloh of Washington Heights and Inwood.  This was based near the leading Orthodox Jewish synagogue on Bennett Avenue, K’hal Adath Jeshurun, at Bennett Avenue and 186th Street.  The EMT corps was NYS certified in emergency care and procedures, with the staff taking refresher courses and passing yearly NYS re-certification tests.  The EMTs and paramedics were/are primarily observant Jewish men in their 20s-40s, all of whom are very committed to saving lives and assisting medically in their immediate area.

•	The ‘street-cop’, a patrolman who walked the streets, knew nearly everyone and was aware of the tone of his ‘beat’, essentially disappeared, with, at the very best, occasional police cars cruising the streets, but rarely stopping.


•	Small grocery stores, “bodegas”, assumed additional functions, becoming the hubs of illicit gambling and drug sales.  This was obvious even to the least aware resident, who could view (especially on Friday nights) parades of cars pulling up in front of a grocery store, certainly not to purchase only chips, sodas or beers.

•	Storefront social clubs were created at venues which previously had been small businesses.  These clubs had opaque-covered up front windows and, it was rumored, admission was restricted to only those who were known to the ‘watchman.’  It was widely assumed that the social clubs were hubs for a steady drug trade.  There were stabbings, shootings and even murders at these clubs.  The social club on my street had several shootings, causing many long-time residents to flee the area and relocate to Riverdale and Queens as quickly as they could find another affordable apartment.  However, as it happened, the owner of this club was then shot and killed – and finally – the place closed down for lack of someone to pay the rent on the facility.

•	According to official police records, the 34th Precinct, which then covered northern Manhattan from 165th Street to the end of the island, had the highest arson, drug and murder rate in Manhattan and was among the top 5 precincts in New York City with the highest levels of serious crimes.

•	This interviewee personally witnessed street fights on our residential street, amongst 100-150 young men, many of them swinging machetes against each other.  Clearly, these were horrifying events which frightened long-time law-abiding residents.

•	Consequently, the stability of the area was severely compromised, causing tenant relocations to safer areas (in NYC, on Long Island, and to New Jersey).  With vacant apartments, many landlords cut-back on maintenance, the delivery of hot water and heat, building repairs, street repairs, painting and plastering apartments, etc.  Apartments were vacant, with occasional squatters.  Landlords began to utilize superintendents (who were untrained in plumbing, plastering, electrical and other repairs) to bring in new tenants whose rents would be heavily subsidized by Federal, State or City housing assistance programs.  Some were “Section 8” tenants; in other cases, 6-8 people (not including infants) lived in an apartment which had previously accommodated 3-5 persons.   

•	The density of the population further exacerbated the living situation, both within the building and especially, in the summer months, when nearly everyone would sit on the pavement, on cars, on fire escapes, etc., so as to try to cool off.  Many people would play radios out loud (all tuned to different stations) and continue throughout the nights since many did not have steady employment and did not need to sleep so as to hold down a job.


Medical Services in northern Manhattan in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the post WWII area, health insurance was a luxury.  My own parents, who emigrated to the USA after the War, and had been fortunate enough to spend the war years in Great Britain, were aghast to discover that in the USA, there was no national health insurance.  My mother often remarked that even as ‘a bloody refugee’ in England, she knew that she could receive medical care if necessary.  

In our own family, my father struggled to earn a modest income.  There were no luxuries and we did with very little.  My sister and I usually wore ‘hand-me-down’ clothing, received from older girls who lived in our building, baby-sitters or older relatives.

I mention this only to highlight the urgency and sacrifices which were made by my parents so that our family would have, at least, what was called “Major Medical” coverage – for hospitalization and out-patient surgery.  The premiums were paid by our family; this coverage was not included in any so-called job benefits.  It was quite difficult - - 

In terms of primary medical care, many doctors in our area converted residential apartments to offices.  In our own building, in Apt. A6 on the main floor, right off the lobby, Dr. Fox practiced (she was a lady.)  She and her husband (a teacher) lived in a 5-room apartment:  the hallway and another room were converted to a waiting room and storage facility; another room was converted to an examination room; there may have been a smaller room converted to a lab or x-ray developing room and/or medical supply storage room.  Patients paid cash unless they had medical coverage through a union plan.  It was comforting to have a doctor so near our apartment, even though Dr. Fox was not our family doctor.

The Neumann family went to Dr. Frederic Grossman, who maintained offices nearby, at 20 Sherman Avenue.  Dr. Grossman’s wife, Friedel, was a registered nurse who assisted him greatly.  Dr. Grossman’s practice consisted of his office, containing an examination table; the nurse’s room, containing a bed/stretcher sometimes used for ‘sunlight-electric light’ treatments for frail children, and a waiting room, always filled with at least 20-30 people waiting to see the doctor.  I remember there was a refrigerator in the corner of the waiting room, filled with bottles of Ginger Ale.  Dr. Grossman would stop into the waiting room, say hello to those assembled there, and take a big cup of Ginger Ale prior to seeing the next patient.  

Patients were seen on a first-come, first served basis, unless there was a dire emergency.  Payments were in cash; the doctor charged very little to each patient.

If someone was very sick, as I was when I had Measles, Chicken Pox and German Measles, Dr. Grossman would make a house visit and provide treatment.  He always came when he said he would come, even if he was running late.

There were other doctors in our immediate area.  Among them were Dr. Fox, (previously mentioned); Dr. Samuel Gelmann (his office was in 2 Thayer Street, later he relocated to Riverside Drive); and Drs. Ludwig Wolfermann, a medical doctor and his wife, Dr. Joan Wolfermann, a practicing dentist, on Riverside Drive.  Dr. Franklin Ward, a well-known and beloved doctor, maintained his office on 204th Street near Seaman Avenue.  (After Dr. Grossman retired, the Neumanns often went to Dr. Ward for medical assistance.)  I believe there were other physicians in the immediate area.

Many doctors in our area were Jewish doctors who needed ‘admitting rights’ for their patients to a local hospital.  In those days, Columbia Presbyterian Hospital was known to have a discriminatory policy against Jewish doctors.  Consequently, the doctors I mentioned above, and others, brought their patients to smaller, less known and now defunct hospitals.  These included:
•	Gotham Hospital (located then on 76th Street at Fifth Avenue)
•	Wadsworth Hospital (formerly on 185th Street near Wadsworth Avenue); 
•	St. Elizabeth Hospital (a small Catholic hospital on Ft. Washington Avenue at 190th Street – now converted to luxury residential condominiums) and 
•	Jewish Memorial Hospital, at 4600 Broadway at ~196th Street.  (This location is now Intermediate School 218 – the Salome Urena de Henrique School.)

In terms of protecting children against polio, the Salk vaccine was the only vaccine available in the 1950s.  All children, including those who attended private and/or parochial schools, were vaccinated.  I received four injections – all were administered at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on 168th Street.  We were taken class by class.  We all had to line up, it was done rather quickly, and we received a lollypop (although I recall that I received a lollypop that was not the color I had requested.)  

We were the lucky kids:  I recall that a girl on my block, who was probably not more than 2-3 years old than I was, was stricken with polio.  While later in life, she was able to walk, she always needed two canes or a walker to get around.  She married, held down a job and bore two children.  She seems to have raised them by herself (her husband was known to be a drunk and was rarely seen with the children.)  She worked until she must have been in her early 60s, living all the time in the same house where she grew up.  I heard that she has now retired and that her daughter, who lives ‘upstate’, asked her mother to come and live with her.

I recall that when I was in (Yeshiva Soloveichik’s) elementary school, there was great debate about supplying children in parochial schools with milk containers.  The argument against this was the division of state and church:  it was said that children who attended religious schools should provide on their own for milk cartons.  The counter argument, which finally prevailed, was that the health and nutrition of children should not be dependent on the type of education they received.  All children should be supplied with a small container of milk for lunch.  Thankfully, this view prevailed and we, in religious day schools, were able to receive our milk.
