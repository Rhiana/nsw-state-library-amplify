1
00:00:19,59 --> 00:00:31,93
Because i think that what i wanted to make was right. To do. Just google.

2
00:00:31,93 --> 00:00:40,22
Because it's a very long while you know i was young but i would have to be two.

3
00:00:40,22 --> 00:00:47,89
And then if you're drawn into where you have to go from got a game to this it's great to be a mile up with another.

4
00:00:47,89 --> 00:01:28,5
Two more than that guy. That would come to your brother would to get him to think about that you know the clock tool.

5
00:01:28,5 --> 00:01:35,56
Pretty much. How many.

6
00:01:39,88 --> 00:01:57,24
Probably twenty something like that i can tell you i have no problem at all good luck to him always good luck with the

7
00:01:57,24 --> 00:02:05,37
i think that we're trying to speak italian but of course. Not knowing that with my brother going into a few scrapes.

8
00:02:05,37 --> 00:02:19,12
And i will tell you. Cool teachers. School teacher was just adorable. And he had a little kids. Little boy.

9
00:02:19,12 --> 00:02:27,83
And my brother was real good. All of taught. And this little kid coming down was teasing him.

10
00:02:27,83 --> 00:02:39,55
So he picked him up and put him up for banning the french have really turned him around the guys.

11
00:02:39,55 --> 00:02:55,38
Back three months time. We were in effect. And i think out it shouldn't do that but with us now it was pretty good.

12
00:02:55,38 --> 00:03:00,95
But. When i think you put a lot.

13
00:03:00,95 --> 00:03:10,4
I think you realize that we were terry and because of that he felt good and i thought that you probably put up with.

14
00:03:10,4 --> 00:03:19,47
What he might know. Them with another. Of a trial probably. That's just my impression. And what.

15
00:03:19,47 --> 00:03:25,43
Just my mind just because i'm grateful. You know now that. You know that nobody here.

16
00:03:25,43 --> 00:03:52,98
You know that will call the roll call. You keep in touch with them and. Not a friend.

17
00:03:52,98 --> 00:04:01,39
Now and i'm saying the wrong thing i'd add an extra kept in touch but strangely enough. One of the boys.

18
00:04:01,39 --> 00:04:10,45
That went to the school now with you straight to my boat from you and your sister used to go to.

19
00:04:11,29 --> 00:04:19,43
Why haven't i have actually kept in touch but we made up i have also recently i've joined the bond dos authority

20
00:04:19,43 --> 00:04:32,16
and through that i met another girl with him on this week. One thing. But actually having good contacts.

21
00:04:32,16 --> 00:04:41,34
Actually let's hear me young. To get you guys who will probably come to that lie that.

22
00:04:41,34 --> 00:04:46,53
We didn't get to the christmas tree. I remember going to the christmas tree which was absolutely magical.

23
00:04:46,53 --> 00:04:58,81
For me because the minute you log on one time on your old uniform. On the legal bill to me.

24
00:04:58,81 --> 00:05:05,87
And another time i was given a little doll that first started writing monologues. And i thought it was very beautiful.

25
00:05:05,87 --> 00:05:13,38
Until my brother annette read it coming i haven't to say what it was you know. And it was. Drawl.

26
00:05:13,38 --> 00:05:18,61
And i cried and cried i didn't want my doll to have straw in the coming.

27
00:05:18,61 --> 00:05:29,07
And i don't know what happened to the government and they are probably people that no one. But you sort of played guy.

28
00:05:29,07 --> 00:05:30,57
And things like that you know.

29
00:05:30,57 --> 00:05:39,82
Santa kind which was to me was just something you know nothing like in ny were none of them none of them.

30
00:05:39,82 --> 00:05:49,95
But it's one thing to have very much.

31
00:05:49,95 --> 00:05:56,71
The reason i named for santa claus but that's really the phantom which means in life.

32
00:05:56,71 --> 00:06:03,51
But i mean when you're poor you know. There's something very special next. History.

33
00:06:03,51 --> 00:06:15,06
So you have sort of special diaries in them and i called across to the drawing. That. And that special. Courage and.

34
00:06:15,06 --> 00:06:23,1
They still have a print and i have my per lot of women. Mike of course. Not that i'm really good at cooking on.

35
00:06:23,1 --> 00:06:30,23
Rachel of course. Your the same of course the girl from your mother.

36
00:06:33,47 --> 00:06:39,83
But we didn't have to be on the end of the bottle to do that when there were that more

37
00:06:39,83 --> 00:06:45,6
or less the syme it was racial a carson. And another man made a quarter.

38
00:06:45,6 --> 00:07:00,02
Which is nothing like the tour guide there were mine here. But it with my blood that that course from the pain.

39
00:07:00,02 --> 00:07:03,64
I have since time out he has in mind if he

40
00:07:03,64 --> 00:07:26,24
and i are agreeing with you you are the type to put it in religion to grab your mom out of court noise. And i thought.

41
00:07:26,24 --> 00:07:46,39
Well i had living with my father and mother had contact with his mom right. To them right up till you'd have gone.

42
00:07:46,39 --> 00:08:03,71
Oh you must make personal family. Do you have a. Well let me come back. That night with them and.

43
00:08:03,71 --> 00:08:16,68
I found that more surprising than what i thought. If you have ever. Completely foreign news.

44
00:08:16,68 --> 00:08:28,32
Are you switch to the same dollars. You would have and are probably different than in this thing. Are you.

45
00:08:28,32 --> 00:08:43,16
That problem. No two just recently. And that you know it. Well. That was one of them.

46
00:08:44,51 --> 00:08:57,82
You'd have was when the chips nuts were the monk how you know how one might have a hobby. Drinking wine and chestnut.

47
00:08:57,82 --> 00:09:10,17
And it happened that we played both an airplane and one when we now want to think that this was so thrilled about it.

48
00:09:10,17 --> 00:09:17,28
That i said i want to be celebrated. Since i was in your fill of dried up half life. Which is here.

49
00:09:17,28 --> 00:09:22,88
And then it sort of went on from and someone said well why don't we make it a chestnut march which we did

50
00:09:22,88 --> 00:09:33,31
and we had people kind of like the original ones would have been the ones that were in the committee.

51
00:09:33,31 --> 00:09:40,93
And it was strange and they are sort of. Step back and look at them. And this is. This is just like a very.

52
00:09:40,93 --> 00:09:47,6
And it brings back memories. And i regard them are very much you knew i wasn't very impressed.

53
00:09:47,6 --> 00:09:52,94
Where did you get that from. But for in truth the guy being.

54
00:09:52,94 --> 00:10:07,32
Actually more than you can come up with pretty critical of will. And then take them. But we turn to bob if you can.

55
00:10:07,32 --> 00:10:15,09
To remember the first not. The algorithm. The hair grew little that were you know.

56
00:10:15,09 --> 00:10:27,67
And that when you turn that on the first one. Probably ties because they're very expensive.

57
00:10:27,67 --> 00:10:38,6
And the washing is a work of ox. And it used to be a kerosene tin and i can't remember how you kind of exactly.

58
00:10:38,6 --> 00:10:43,94
But i think you would kind of ruin the top and bottom.

59
00:10:43,94 --> 00:10:52,79
And then the saw a new one so i don't cotton to have it you could i tend to trying. Ground but.

60
00:10:52,79 --> 00:10:59,27
I would say you wouldn't cut just so. One would use it for washing at one time for washing up.

61
00:10:59,27 --> 00:11:08,88
And one thought for rinsing. Which might a terrific team and i had one of those for washing up. So yeah.

62
00:11:08,88 --> 00:11:15,36
Could we have washed their hands and saw and we had a little bench outside. Like a laundry.

63
00:11:15,36 --> 00:11:26,42
Sort of thing my two little tub and everyone had that because we use for a lot of english. Now i mean.

64
00:11:26,42 --> 00:11:31,7
But they're not much of me don't go into the hands of the rich but i don't know where that matters.

65
00:11:31,7 --> 00:11:36,01
From because i haven't i haven't been one are rotten with them

66
00:11:36,01 --> 00:11:47,17
and i can remember several of his friends you know that having to do the dishes once a day. Now i think that was done.

67
00:11:47,17 --> 00:11:57,99
Every day. And that was what you want to because you're looking at a fair. Government for how. Family. Sideline.

68
00:11:57,99 --> 00:12:04,1
You in the order. Washing and that would be put on the day and you can remember on.

69
00:12:04,1 --> 00:12:14,13
Turn your back after paris alarming out to what would what i would do. That would first be rinsed out and.

70
00:12:14,13 --> 00:12:24,31
Any sort of scraps that came up your pride to met when. Towards the free from pain. Nothing was wise to.

71
00:12:24,31 --> 00:12:33,77
Nothing but with the situation where did you watch the dishes to wash up every day

72
00:12:33,77 --> 00:12:40,89
but the thing is that if it really rain shorts or record rain short actually.

73
00:12:40,89 --> 00:12:47,28
You wouldn't get your water for washing up and for washing grounds from a creek. Or from a will.

74
00:12:47,28 --> 00:12:52,42
I think you might have had a world cup. Because the country. Could you have.

75
00:12:52,42 --> 00:12:57,11
You would have to get water from somewhere because that wouldn't do you say you. When you were running.

76
00:12:57,11 --> 00:13:12,00
You can't keep them from drinking water little people from the family. Small plane.

77
00:13:12,00 --> 00:13:20,96
And we start wondering whether would be a must.

78
00:13:20,96 --> 00:13:27,45
Was a peak an expensive item when it wasn't going to carry expensive items because it was bought and you're right.

79
00:13:27,45 --> 00:13:38,61
You still have a little piece in many of the scraps from the kitchen before feeding it grew around corn. So that was.

80
00:13:38,61 --> 00:13:44,58
Into it and. The white from up to my room. Got a cherry tree.

81
00:13:44,58 --> 00:13:53,3
But it was really inexpensive to feed in and it was very lives we could do for barry.

82
00:13:53,3 --> 00:13:58,27
And it was very large for the killer.

83
00:13:58,27 --> 00:14:01,89
And of course us children were made to go why it will make you all that

84
00:14:01,89 --> 00:14:10,45
but are you taking this one paygo thing i'm going up to think it was very nice anyway. So i never looked again.

85
00:14:10,77 --> 00:14:25,21
Just sausages. So mommy the sausages. Nothing that was cool with you two which your my with that wasn't the best.

86
00:14:25,21 --> 00:14:28,55
And you put this you actually mean step.

87
00:14:28,55 --> 00:14:29,82
The skin of the wrong

88
00:14:29,82 --> 00:14:43,35
and the people who met the sausages in the call to give me a line in the first with my with the maid.

89
00:14:43,35 --> 00:14:49,71
But have a little blood on it with something. And i would go in a very short time. Because they wouldn't take long.

90
00:14:49,71 --> 00:14:54,83
That the salami liquidity would have to last too quickly or year.

91
00:14:54,83 --> 00:15:02,97
And i had no preservatives in them at all what they did was that i dug how. Under the house.

92
00:15:02,97 --> 00:15:11,48
And they put boards around it and turned it into a cellar. Yellow hair. From when i can remember.

93
00:15:11,48 --> 00:15:16,82
It was under the house. And the law of the house was the top of the cellar.

94
00:15:16,82 --> 00:15:21,54
But i was talking to my sister the other guy and she said there really really first one which i don't remember.

95
00:15:21,54 --> 00:15:27,21
Was a big box in the family how dug in the ground and the big box was put there

96
00:15:27,21 --> 00:15:36,31
and we kept it i don't remember that we put it in. And it had to be the coolest you could.

97
00:15:36,31 --> 00:15:40,94
And he went awry and of course water when you do it. But you have to take the salami like a month and.

98
00:15:40,94 --> 00:15:49,13
Start your viral order atlas and running it open and when it was drawn put them back in again because of.

99
00:15:49,13 --> 00:16:02,78
Very important here because there were things that we had to have time for and that was enough to have we got better

100
00:16:02,78 --> 00:16:10,45
and a bit more will have to play with that for us. And the crew to give you something that you call your actually.

101
00:16:10,72 --> 00:16:29,15
It's called. Whereas some actually. If you didn't know one might go on.

102
00:16:29,15 --> 00:16:31,93
It would give them our diversity

103
00:16:31,93 --> 00:16:38,21
and that would help people draw i think you have a case that we know right from that that it was that would go out

104
00:16:38,21 --> 00:16:56,45
there that night it didn't draw actually draw at all and. Tell you that you took. The lower leg which.

105
00:16:56,45 --> 00:17:01,24
You don't want to use and i mean because they're not they're not to roll.

106
00:17:01,24 --> 00:17:10,8
So you get all that and then you get the wrong one from the people that thought actually a thing to get from italy.

107
00:17:10,8 --> 00:17:26,31
To the things that would means that i have and i would put you in bed.

108
00:17:26,31 --> 00:17:32,93
And it would actually give you one skin because it's the appendix.

109
00:17:32,93 --> 00:17:35,67
There that you would have to top the bottom of the boat and.

110
00:17:35,67 --> 00:17:44,53
It's already ran and put it in very tightly you taught your cool because you want to create that.

111
00:17:44,53 --> 00:17:47,8
And then get hard on cult. Three strings around.

112
00:17:47,8 --> 00:17:54,6
Harden and put a little how in one year somebody forgot to put how my old first lot

113
00:17:54,6 --> 00:18:00,59
but then you'd hang them up to draw your name up in your kitchen actually

114
00:18:00,59 --> 00:18:17,35
and to order it said get the bill before that but i don't know. What or love lasted long. Salami.

115
00:18:17,35 --> 00:18:32,66
Yes because that ring the old one. Because you know that you couldn't get you the actual thing that.

116
00:18:32,66 --> 00:18:40,26
It was getting all natural feelings toward the salami with. No that's not going to die i'm not here.

117
00:18:40,26 --> 00:18:59,85
Looking good now but for the food them only natural.

118
00:18:59,85 --> 00:19:03,79
Source of income has been a civil war in the mountains

119
00:19:03,79 --> 00:19:14,06
and starting to be here shortly after we came up being before there wasn't a road up to the plantation.

120
00:19:14,06 --> 00:19:20,14
So there have to be counted. With the horse and spring cowboy chap. That all remembers me.

121
00:19:20,14 --> 00:19:27,29
He would pick them up and take them to the top of the very state heel and send them down the long folks.

122
00:19:27,29 --> 00:19:35,75
And be the carrier. Jack brain with the carrier and he'd write down on the coffin came bryant. And he'd stop them.

123
00:19:35,75 --> 00:19:42,01
Damn near. Put them on these trucks and take them into the right away to be sent to sydney. Yes.

124
00:19:42,01 --> 00:19:49,23
Where are you remember one time. Somebody did somebody to get them applause. Prox. I wouldn't say it.

125
00:19:49,23 --> 00:19:50,11
But i believe you

126
00:19:50,11 --> 00:19:56,6
when they haven't really got to the bottom of this i want to find out that you're going to hear it with a very long

127
00:19:56,6 --> 00:20:01,53
and. You know how you can read them to on the cards as martin.

128
00:20:01,53 --> 00:20:07,31
Stopped in time on the something the kind that you write a lot. It was working the system you send something down.

129
00:20:07,31 --> 00:20:10,45
In something awful things that i don't.

130
00:20:11,18 --> 00:20:32,74
Exactly what process we're in the process for i'm actually going to be better than i were lighter got a little twirl

131
00:20:32,74 --> 00:20:44,78
lighter. But bad that sometimes. Thirty forty cases of bigger crisis. Than what we have now.

132
00:20:44,78 --> 00:20:51,63
Maybe half a dozen in the stands that get nothing out of that you had your production costs which christ.

133
00:20:51,63 --> 00:20:59,99
Start up with you carry me to carry them i'm told it was very high. The only way we actually believe.

134
00:20:59,99 --> 00:21:10,01
Because we were pretty self-sufficient. And that the target or not there were things that you had to boil and. From.

135
00:21:10,01 --> 00:21:16,81
So i could remember there were shopkeeper in town jack. Or a jam or a you had a shop.

136
00:21:16,81 --> 00:21:21,13
You know our industry was going on the railway station.

137
00:21:21,13 --> 00:21:29,71
We had a shop there for a long time the two would live straight with the imperial.

138
00:21:29,71 --> 00:21:33,94
And he would give credit to the italians.

139
00:21:33,94 --> 00:21:36,78
And he carried it would carry them month after month you know

140
00:21:36,78 --> 00:21:43,51
and probably wouldn't even ask for money because he didn't have any in the line. And also knew that it was very cool.

141
00:21:43,51 --> 00:21:54,27
That would hire them. That women. And things like that that would get some money. Vegetables were a good proposition.

142
00:21:54,27 --> 00:22:08,12
In that because that would be seem to suit me in them in the winter months where they couldn't grab them. So much and.

143
00:22:08,12 --> 00:22:18,26
That would be worth money. That's. Rights of our very first time when they were planning to actually plant the brains.

144
00:22:18,26 --> 00:22:32,67
In between the bananas. Which would give them a quick quick quick. Not just a go.

145
00:22:32,67 --> 00:23:12,33
But tied to modern life can remember was right and right now. We cannot go before that.

146
00:23:12,33 --> 00:23:15,97
Because that's been on the git go. So the better.

147
00:23:15,97 --> 00:24:03,34
We should rather not start yelling which is why i wanted to log on which was on the top of a problem which we call.

148
00:24:03,34 --> 00:24:22,74
The rod sometimes with a lighter on. Right. On the carrier coming to the f.a.a. Getting to the area.

149
00:24:22,74 --> 00:24:37,56
But one toilet system was pregnant too and she had to get probably. And the anyway the guy with the carrier or.

150
00:24:37,56 --> 00:24:52,35
This guy. My mother when you sit down. She was sitting in the front and. She had to sit on top of the light.

151
00:24:52,35 --> 00:24:57,2
And i think just a little part of. Forward to see. The keiser.

152
00:24:57,2 --> 00:25:15,32
Something that she was told to remember because she was probably like you want to think i got someone to help them.

153
00:25:15,32 --> 00:25:47,83
You have to work. The more you. Don't. Which would be daunting and it was placed in the school.

154
00:25:47,83 --> 00:26:01,91
Where once again they were to bring the girls to the kitchen for lights in the bathrooms.

155
00:26:01,91 --> 00:26:16,27
On the corner of the brain that you were going to get you could. She never called for. She always had a star.

156
00:26:16,27 --> 00:26:27,53
You still didn't have many italians.

157
00:26:27,53 --> 00:26:32,46
Around him all the time lives are on some kind

158
00:26:32,46 --> 00:26:48,76
but never anyone close close to is not just a thing as a child growing up was very lonely because we had not had no

159
00:26:48,76 --> 00:26:58,67
other children. Like brother nars.

160
00:26:58,67 --> 00:27:11,4
But i was the one that was always getting into trouble with the little child being me. And then i can be trouble.

161
00:27:11,4 --> 00:27:26,57
Trouble. What kind of punishment. Except for you. Yelling at me helping dad that were very much. Kids and not.

162
00:27:26,57 --> 00:27:34,34
You know. Very much that they're actually my father and. Little mom not at all.

163
00:27:34,34 --> 00:27:49,33
But i just remember place that's where my other sister my sister got married from my friends with two daughters who

164
00:27:49,33 --> 00:27:56,81
were different down the road during ruby. And one of them. Did the most beautiful very fun stuff that i did the same.

165
00:27:56,81 --> 00:27:59,85
So i haven't seen anybody even if i haven't seen the scene.

166
00:27:59,85 --> 00:28:03,21
And she had asked him to do what i imagine my ass to do

167
00:28:03,21 --> 00:28:10,45
and it wouldn't have been she done all this question for my sister who was going to get married when it got.

168
00:28:10,59 --> 00:28:18,66
I put it all out on the bay and it covered the how bad and. Up on to realize. And it was absolutely beautiful.

169
00:28:18,66 --> 00:28:21,88
And moss just to had all this. In our head not going.

170
00:28:21,88 --> 00:28:26,81
How i really do you see

171
00:28:26,81 --> 00:28:36,33
nor can remember telling us to get married then why would we want to have to fix you take your car for two anyway i

172
00:28:36,33 --> 00:28:46,59
think that guy and me want to keep me quiet in that arc and during member heroin or you know dollars from the label.

173
00:28:46,59 --> 00:29:03,38
And never having seen anything like that you know she got married. And she was being twenty two years.

174
00:29:03,38 --> 00:29:10,64
I can really still hold its treasure and i am nothing. And what was what was she having done.

175
00:29:10,64 --> 00:29:15,25
Well apparently she'd been the name just before so you know i think she needed more feelings.

176
00:29:15,25 --> 00:29:19,02
But she decided she wasn't going to happen because she was getting married soon.

177
00:29:19,02 --> 00:29:29,6
So i said jeannette spend the money on her but the other tellings we can use are the ones that you do. Come across.

178
00:29:29,6 --> 00:29:39,57
Did you understand. At that time more or less kind. From the sign. Place. From northern italy.

179
00:29:39,57 --> 00:29:47,14
That could have things that i didn't come in contact with them. So i really don't know. But probably the syrians.

180
00:29:47,14 --> 00:29:54,27
Would have spoken to tell you the true ten. Which my parents would have understood. I didn't. The time i do now.

181
00:29:54,27 --> 00:30:00,7
But at the time when. So you're taught. Well i didn't actually teach me in dollars.

182
00:30:00,7 --> 00:30:10,45
We were just five dollars at the time it wasn't actually taught what to tell you nothing. And the crew. Because.

183
00:30:12,36 --> 00:30:15,1
Not a very complicated.

184
00:30:15,1 --> 00:30:17,77
Conversation i mean you go to a lawyer

185
00:30:17,77 --> 00:30:28,65
and my status very very probably will know what that word about myself on the line. I can understand that.

186
00:30:28,65 --> 00:30:42,62
Did you probably actually hear that he was from behind me too. Very much ram and.

187
00:30:42,62 --> 00:31:04,65
The families knew each other they were just the family lived or a brother did come. His brother but that's all.

188
00:31:04,65 --> 00:31:10,87
I think up got to the school a copy came. Where our winters no longer.

189
00:31:10,87 --> 00:31:13,56
It is for the dam right now to go to work in their lives.

190
00:31:14,61 --> 00:31:27,89
I don't know what year it was year one and all the school records were lost there some people have a few fires

191
00:31:27,89 --> 00:31:41,03
and i do have a practical. Became a long summary rather than have one of the. Three or four of us were going to school.

192
00:31:41,03 --> 00:31:53,53
They're headed for trouble and the cops came because there wasn't a road to coffee.

193
00:31:53,53 --> 00:31:59,91
What we'd have to get was for have a go with a carrier. All of the time. You.
