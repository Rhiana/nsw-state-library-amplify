1
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:25,85
I think if people have no. Nothing more in common than wanting to live in the country.

2
00:00:25,85 --> 00:00:31,01
And they don't even from the start. What you know i think. These are the people i want to live with.

3
00:00:31,01 --> 00:00:36,51
But just that they all come together for economic reasons that. It's quite stunning if they succeed.

4
00:00:36,51 --> 00:00:44,46
And can overcome the conflict and find the motivation. To solve problems with doubts. I think we were at it.

5
00:00:44,46 --> 00:00:52,14
Made it really easy for us else to have a set of spiritually based. You know century that we had in common.

6
00:00:52,14 --> 00:01:07,24
I think that was really important. Well if you know mike lee.

7
00:01:07,24 --> 00:01:13,28
We're not self-sustaining in any sense and in fact where i'm from the beginning we never.

8
00:01:14,53 --> 00:01:24,4
Made any claims that that's what we wanted to do or anything so we haven't had that sort of ideal to live up to.

9
00:01:24,4 --> 00:01:32,01
Economically i don't think communities are viable. The whole society. Works against it and.

10
00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:35,51
Some people in fact mourn the fact that here the days are gone

11
00:01:35,51 --> 00:01:40,15
when everybody was home every day doing things on the phone. Because we're not anymore.

12
00:01:40,15 --> 00:01:50,06
Just about everybody's got a job. People are studying. Some days. There would only be a couple of people at home and.

13
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:56,02
You know you could easily say oh isn't that sad they're not together anymore. But again.

14
00:01:56,02 --> 00:02:01,13
You know your needs and your interests change and.

15
00:02:01,13 --> 00:02:08,41
Most of us are at the time in our lives when we really want to be mixing it up in the wider community. So.

16
00:02:08,41 --> 00:02:16,78
I don't know if this place is viable but it shouldn't be by any sort of. Standards you know i just it just.

17
00:02:16,78 --> 00:02:32,02
I think works in spite of. In spite of the forces around it some. Yes absolutely absolutely.

18
00:02:32,02 --> 00:02:38,36
There's some people here who never would be on the job. But most of us were.

19
00:02:38,36 --> 00:02:45,88
And of course at that time it was very easy to be. A couple years after we were here.

20
00:02:45,88 --> 00:02:52,8
We were quite effected by a man named stephen gaskin who was there later as if i'm in tennessee

21
00:02:52,8 --> 00:03:03,12
and came to the main area and talked with lots of people around and. We at that time body found discussed how could we.

22
00:03:03,12 --> 00:03:09,49
Number one and. Share our income totally did we want to do that in could we create our own livelihood.

23
00:03:09,49 --> 00:03:14,37
So that we could get off the dole some of us did.

24
00:03:14,37 --> 00:03:21,8
My partner and i started a business which supported us for five years and. Also employed other people on the phone.

25
00:03:22,33 --> 00:03:30,47
But we were never that tight a group that we could all agree or people were willing to put aside their own interests

26
00:03:30,47 --> 00:03:36,6
and say oh yes ok. Well here's an income generating. Thing i'm going to forget about what i want to do and do this.

27
00:03:36,6 --> 00:03:44,28
That just never worked. And yes so the welfare state of course. In many ways made this possible. Sure.

28
00:03:56,55 --> 00:04:03,82
Yeah yeah yeah well terrain creek was a tremendous thing for us. Lots of other people.

29
00:04:05,29 --> 00:04:12,04
My partner at the time john seed chris is now. A globe trotter for the rain forest.

30
00:04:12,04 --> 00:04:18,97
And there's lots of other people who have very strong. Leanings in that way this.

31
00:04:18,97 --> 00:04:29,51
To people who live here now who work very hard for the rain forest informations. And we've supported lots of projects.

32
00:04:30,6 --> 00:04:36,71
To do with fighting and sand mining and. Deforestation all kinds of things like that.

33
00:04:36,71 --> 00:04:42,44
So of course it's a very very strong. Value that we hold. And sometimes.

34
00:04:42,44 --> 00:04:49,25
Sometimes i think about the wider community in general like you know. Name and. Be everywhere that.

35
00:04:49,25 --> 00:04:53,34
Maybe we're just pawns in the trees hands and all that.

36
00:04:53,34 --> 00:04:56,66
All that really matters about what about coming here

37
00:04:56,66 --> 00:05:04,42
and living in this area is that in some way that the trees are got a chance to grow. Well they're in a position.

38
00:05:04,42 --> 00:05:21,65
That's a fantasy that if we do nothing else. That's fantastic. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:05:21,65 --> 00:05:30,54
Just about the whole time ended up down at the creek camp and. We'd already had a bit of. You know.

40
00:05:30,54 --> 00:05:37,82
Practice in organizing ourselves in let's do some people got involved in running the first a sort of organisation down

41
00:05:37,82 --> 00:05:46,47
there and others were into communication. And that. That interest rate. Stayed very strong.

42
00:05:46,47 --> 00:05:53,14
Several people went down to the franklin and also to gun responsible jobs in helping that. Movement.

43
00:05:53,14 --> 00:05:59,74
Do the job it had to do. And then years later. Course there was the fight for the night camp national forest.

44
00:05:59,74 --> 00:06:09,43
And again i mean like there was a big bamboo aerial. Pole off my bread and a c.b.

45
00:06:09,43 --> 00:06:18,04
Radio going all the time from the mountain. This is a black stump over to silence. And. And.

46
00:06:18,04 --> 00:06:23,69
It's always been a really good feeling for people here to get involved you know to lend a hand

47
00:06:23,69 --> 00:06:37,00
and become involved in those things and. John seed left here about nine years ago. Left like the five. But we really.

48
00:06:37,00 --> 00:06:45,31
Support what he does and. Welcome him back when every comes back to us trail and. He gets a lot of support.

49
00:06:45,31 --> 00:07:14,96
Moral support from the people here. Yeah. Well green and also other things too. I mean there's a couple of people. Ok.

50
00:07:14,96 --> 00:07:26,51
I guess that we see. Spiritual inquiry. As all. All those things as having to do with greenness and.

51
00:07:26,51 --> 00:07:36,95
With multiculturalism and so on i mean it's not the first time that a sporting is environmental is and.

52
00:07:36,95 --> 00:07:47,75
Is to us i think also the question of native native peoples. Is important to us. Education on all levels.

53
00:07:47,75 --> 00:07:55,36
We see as part of that people are involved in primary. And tertiary education here.

54
00:07:55,36 --> 00:08:02,86
And things like we have to we have two guys here who are very very much into men. The men's issues and.

55
00:08:02,86 --> 00:08:14,42
Really like organizing groups of men to talk about where their place in the scheme of things in it is so. Yes.

56
00:08:14,43 --> 00:08:23,73
I do yeah about what's so worthwhile spiritual pursuit. Is very very broad. I mean they. This.

57
00:08:23,73 --> 00:08:28,1
Also presume here who's actually leading retreats now. And self so.

58
00:08:28,1 --> 00:08:34,62
Is the whole gamut of other people who feel that a very good way of inquiry serco counseling

59
00:08:34,62 --> 00:08:38,26
and run code counseling groups.

60
00:08:38,26 --> 00:08:45,31
Which is a very egalitarian type way of working through one's issues which doesn't involve paying someone a lot of

61
00:08:45,31 --> 00:09:01,58
money and. We keep planting trees which is where that question stat it is really important but.

62
00:09:01,58 --> 00:09:09,5
Just it when your kids grow up and. I guess we just see it is it getting brought you know.

63
00:09:09,5 --> 00:09:23,07
What's important is broader and broader all the time. Speaking oh. Well it's an absolutely wonderful place.

64
00:09:23,55 --> 00:09:27,51
I don't i often wonder what the kids will say.

65
00:09:27,51 --> 00:09:33,76
You know when someone asked them when they're twenty five or thirty how they felt about it. But it's a safe place.

66
00:09:35,32 --> 00:09:45,71
We've got twenty kids around twenty kids in the place. From fifteen years down to four months and.

67
00:09:45,71 --> 00:09:52,49
A lot of those kids have grown up together. Which i think. Is a wonderful thing and was really important.

68
00:09:52,49 --> 00:10:02,2
Will be important in their lives. I've always been quite amazed that. Most of our kids. Don't go. Bush.

69
00:10:02,34 --> 00:10:14,42
They actually don't go exploring in the bush much. I don't know why. But they sure have a good time together here.

70
00:10:17,72 --> 00:10:33,26
I bloody well. Thank you anderson. Anderson yes i mean he is i mean and stewart spit with a city. You know i think.

71
00:10:36,5 --> 00:10:38,63
My name stuart anderson.

72
00:10:38,63 --> 00:10:48,31
And i lived on friday for fifteen years ever since it began a father of four children and sole parent now with.

73
00:10:48,31 --> 00:10:56,8
What's a part time sole parent with three boys come and go with them to weekly combat and my daughter lives in town.

74
00:10:56,8 --> 00:11:04,5
And with the boys who are alone here a body found. Tweens born here at fourteen years ago.

75
00:11:05,41 --> 00:11:11,33
And then the next going to obviously a long time. I'm very much proud of this place.

76
00:11:11,33 --> 00:11:22,76
And you know i feel a lot of affinity for the land and the people here and i know that on. Whale. Well loved and.

77
00:11:22,76 --> 00:11:33,24
I feel needed and part of the prize and that's a wonderful feeling. I've done a range of things in my life.

78
00:11:33,24 --> 00:11:39,68
When i first came here i was a part of. And i set up a pottery. Here.

79
00:11:39,68 --> 00:11:48,66
Which was pretty difficult because we had twins at the same time. And in those days. I had both.

80
00:11:48,66 --> 00:11:54,4
Messages running inside of me but to not be on the dollar and get myself established. And be the provider out.

81
00:11:54,4 --> 00:11:58,5
And also to be the new age dad and do at least fifty percent of the childcare.

82
00:11:58,5 --> 00:12:05,97
Which meant that i just was running it was crazy and new age.

83
00:12:05,97 --> 00:12:12,22
That we considered ourselves out on the communication was very good in this. In that marriage and.

84
00:12:12,22 --> 00:12:16,08
And say seven years later we split up when it was. It was pretty had.

85
00:12:19,24 --> 00:12:28,12
We were daisy and i say that i think i saw enough time to really enjoy each other's company and so on.

86
00:12:28,12 --> 00:12:39,65
When i got from there. There were quite a few things that attracted me to buddy.

87
00:12:39,65 --> 00:12:51,61
And the spiritual or the inquiry into life sort of side of it was a strong one. I had been investigating various.

88
00:12:51,61 --> 00:12:57,71
So-called spiritual avenues the anonymous. And so on and i hadn't. Being particularly drawn to any of them.

89
00:12:57,71 --> 00:12:59,49
Transcendental meditation or whatever.

90
00:13:00,93 --> 00:13:09,82
When i came up here and met the people and and talked to them about their approach with meditation and. Inquiry.

91
00:13:10,66 --> 00:13:17,3
I was really impressed he was a know. Non-dogmatic straight forward sort of.

92
00:13:17,3 --> 00:13:26,75
Practical way of sort of gaining wisdom becoming. Getting to know oneself and getting to know all of life and so on.

93
00:13:26,75 --> 00:13:33,71
And of course there was lots of in the eyes days. We were. Most people have been to india.

94
00:13:33,71 --> 00:13:40,08
And said there were a lot of. Wherein of just sort of indian type clothes for the women and one for the main.

95
00:13:40,08 --> 00:13:42,46
And using indian phrases and sour and.

96
00:13:42,46 --> 00:13:48,49
All sorts of when you say tricky things and enlightenment and girls and things like that which.

97
00:13:48,49 --> 00:13:50,89
I could take although you had been to india but not.

98
00:13:50,89 --> 00:13:57,77
Not on a spiritual quest i mean more and more as a traveler and just enjoying seeing the place and

99
00:13:57,77 --> 00:14:02,72
and olie all the different travelers i mean it.

100
00:14:03,88 --> 00:14:09,96
So that's one thing that attracted me was the non-dogmatic fairly practical. Inquiry. And the time.

101
00:14:09,96 --> 00:14:14,42
Put aside for that and. And that was attractive not only just for myself but also really.

102
00:14:14,6 --> 00:14:21,86
That had good implications for the community it meant that. Any conflict. Or controversy whatever that arise. Was.

103
00:14:21,86 --> 00:14:26,1
Looked at in the light of all what can we learn from these two people having differing opinions

104
00:14:26,1 --> 00:14:32,37
or really feeling angry with each other also behind them in within the community was expected. Of s.o.'s and of.

105
00:14:32,37 --> 00:14:41,58
Each other that we did. We would. Ask yes it will have a contributing to this conflict or whatever it is.

106
00:14:41,58 --> 00:14:49,21
So i was a priest for the mill. Things to learn more from. So that was attractive.

107
00:14:49,21 --> 00:14:55,77
What else was attractive about all this bush this land. It was originally i don't know if you've been told.

108
00:14:55,77 --> 00:15:01,08
Chosen because it had a lovely swimming hole that's about have practical way that.

109
00:15:01,08 --> 00:15:05,14
Running around looking for land ah there's a lovely swimming pool swimming hole in this bit of land and by that.

110
00:15:05,14 --> 00:15:10,3
You know and so agriculturally it's ridiculous and. I think one of the main advantages is that.

111
00:15:10,3 --> 00:15:16,74
That it's not directly on a on a mine ride or anything like that and so it's very very quiet and peaceful here.

112
00:15:17,48 --> 00:15:23,96
And people have to make a bit of an effort to come in they mean it's not right on the y. and. And.

113
00:15:23,96 --> 00:15:39,16
Well there were only half an hour from town it just seems like. It's not easy just a drop in. Personally i wasn't.

114
00:15:39,68 --> 00:15:43,33
I've been living on the it down in the little town called to wamba.

115
00:15:43,33 --> 00:15:52,00
Which is just in one of aden in fast south coast of new south wales. And i've really enjoyed the. Village life there.

116
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:57,24
Knowing a lot of coals and the history that went right back and feeling excepted in feeling like i could contribute.

117
00:15:57,85 --> 00:16:01,49
And that i got my ensoul and one thing i regret.

118
00:16:01,49 --> 00:16:06,91
Regretted about meeting up to this community is i didn't get to make the local so much because we were so busy building

119
00:16:06,91 --> 00:16:12,59
at houses and getting to know each other and and swimming in a lovely so. Sell it and maybe.

120
00:16:12,59 --> 00:16:17,12
You know young dieties everyway at it. I didn't get a chance to meet the locals and i've always felt that.

121
00:16:17,12 --> 00:16:24,89
Out of the gap and. Seems inevitable in a way in and out of that gap there's been a lot of misconceptions about biting.

122
00:16:24,89 --> 00:16:35,13
Where a batter. For example way before last. Me every year we go on and then. We spend a week together.

123
00:16:35,13 --> 00:16:37,85
Having what we call their annual general meeting. It's a company.

124
00:16:37,85 --> 00:16:40,86
Because with my company owns the land for us we have to have this meeting legally

125
00:16:40,86 --> 00:16:45,83
but we use it as an excuse to spend time with one another talking about more long term things

126
00:16:45,83 --> 00:16:53,34
and just enjoy each other's company and. Play and have fun. And we went to a camping ground called what do you hate.

127
00:16:53,34 --> 00:16:59,19
And one of us i've heard. So some of the campus site. On campus i too another good.

128
00:16:59,19 --> 00:17:06,7
Body but i haven't seen anyone in bribes. You know. And it's just that you know. Incredible for us.

129
00:17:06,7 --> 00:17:11,67
And in the early days there was also the resistance from.

130
00:17:11,67 --> 00:17:18,49
It's come to be known innes as the old settlers and there was room to spread about as deliberately and and.

131
00:17:18,49 --> 00:17:21,83
You know that we sell by abuse that women who came and.

132
00:17:21,83 --> 00:17:25,29
Really that we sold by a piece and there was a price i can't remember much ten thousand

133
00:17:25,29 --> 00:17:30,37
or twenty thousand dollars was already q.o.s. and That no woman could come here.

134
00:17:30,37 --> 00:17:33,79
And leave unless she was pregnant for some reason we've never quite figured that one out

135
00:17:33,79 --> 00:17:41,64
but their own room is designed to put a stand and. Make us less acceptable. Not acceptable.

136
00:17:41,64 --> 00:17:49,93
And that was just a small percentage i think of the michael. Because. Because having tweens was hard we didn't.

137
00:17:49,93 --> 00:17:54,96
We hadn't built a house yet. We were in a lodge taint on the floor. We had a home or water but we didn't.

138
00:17:56,18 --> 00:18:01,17
It was a crazy way to buy a nice.

139
00:18:03,07 --> 00:18:08,16
And some of the locals who were very conservative were really very very supportive that is coming

140
00:18:08,16 --> 00:18:10,61
when it have been running for months or whatever.

141
00:18:10,61 --> 00:18:14,42
We could go and wash and that piece there and dry them and then just help us out in winter.

142
00:18:15,01 --> 00:18:19,85
They could we stayed in a has a cup of tea while the washing was being done and and.

143
00:18:19,85 --> 00:18:27,3
They were terrific and it wasn't until the. Attorney craig dispute which sort of split the community.

144
00:18:27,3 --> 00:18:31,95
That seven hundred ten calls a night we just couldn't relate in the same way and i felt really sad about that.

145
00:18:32,19 --> 00:18:38,34
And i imagine i did too but at the time i just was so upset and.

146
00:18:38,34 --> 00:18:50,86
Somehow in my upset i accepted that i had to cut off from me like that. When we were in reasons for coming here.

147
00:18:50,86 --> 00:18:59,16
Reasons for. Joining this community. I'd often indeed. I was brought up in camberwell in my high school yes.

148
00:18:59,16 --> 00:19:05,74
And i often envied some. Couple of my younger brothers who'd gone to the school without walls where.

149
00:19:05,74 --> 00:19:08,44
Camber which had a much freer an easier atmosphere.

150
00:19:08,44 --> 00:19:12,95
And the students and the teachers were more intimate with one another that. They were very friendly got each other.

151
00:19:12,95 --> 00:19:17,55
Hugs and seemed had a lot of fun together rather than just the normal straight jacket of school

152
00:19:17,55 --> 00:19:20,86
and so are sort of jealous of that scene and i came here

153
00:19:20,86 --> 00:19:26,26
and i just walked into a scene like that where people were very open and friendly and warm.

154
00:19:26,26 --> 00:19:35,24
To me and invited me to converse with them at a deva level i suppose than normal and that really attracted me.

155
00:19:35,24 --> 00:19:42,28
I feel that mediately that. I wanted to leave like that with a group of people like that.

156
00:19:42,43 --> 00:20:00,43
I had investigated other communities before that and come across one quite like that. Me. Her and yeah.

157
00:20:00,43 --> 00:20:05,5
We and i were very idealistic and i said i really idealistic.

158
00:20:05,5 --> 00:20:12,55
We thought we would do everything for ourselves that we could. So that was build our own eyes as furniture.

159
00:20:12,55 --> 00:20:22,12
Have our own booths or. Ceremonies director and rides. Are an income somehow it was.

160
00:20:22,12 --> 00:20:33,59
You know no one wanted tavi on the place and. We had this. Sort of create i believe simply said.

161
00:20:33,59 --> 00:20:43,21
Others can simply leave that. What is voluntary simplicity. And that.

162
00:20:44,94 --> 00:20:48,29
So you know i've got no one to blame but myself you know why fit.

163
00:20:48,29 --> 00:20:55,41
For what we went through but you know trying to build a house which wasn't a mud brick house of course. You know which.

164
00:20:55,41 --> 00:21:04,01
You know i took took a lot of work and get a pottery together and raise young baby cries the way.

165
00:21:04,01 --> 00:21:06,45
You know that she paid her for about sorry

166
00:21:06,45 --> 00:21:09,34
but i thought it was just a lot more than turning on the tap in to find the wood

167
00:21:09,34 --> 00:21:16,11
and lot the five it's a damp climates and everything in between would be way to delight and so on.

168
00:21:16,11 --> 00:21:28,21
We might really hard for us and. But the early people it came on to this community where the pioneering time and.

169
00:21:28,21 --> 00:21:34,54
Warrick and the other member of this community was only commenting to me i think it's more just that i morning that.

170
00:21:36,41 --> 00:21:43,89
Thinking back on those days. He wasn't day and. Just thinking about what we did and he likened us to the early funny.

171
00:21:43,89 --> 00:21:49,57
Show we had cast and some other. You know i had more resources at our disposal. But.

172
00:21:49,57 --> 00:21:51,59
We really wanted to do it from the beginning in doing.

173
00:21:51,59 --> 00:21:52,52
Do it for ourselves

174
00:21:52,52 --> 00:22:00,28
and for the first couple of years it was sort of a friend upon to go out of the community just for your self you know

175
00:22:00,28 --> 00:22:05,34
if you're going to go out then you should buy food for everyone else all the other people's needs

176
00:22:05,34 --> 00:22:13,92
and so i going it was a major trick. I just meant if it would be out all day. And we just had. We had communal kind.

177
00:22:13,92 --> 00:22:23,18
And i was. I know with another man with i was a mechanic. So. We worked on the communal couple while others.

178
00:22:23,18 --> 00:22:30,77
Out of the rustic cooking rustic as we ate together every day. And so you know.

179
00:22:30,77 --> 00:22:37,35
They were really sort of heady days to remain we. Working together a lot on buildings.

180
00:22:37,35 --> 00:22:41,27
Feeling like we were all contributing to the same thing. Whatever.

181
00:22:41,27 --> 00:22:43,44
That was we weren't quite you know couldn't quite benign

182
00:22:43,44 --> 00:22:57,05
but it was building this community sharing our lives together as. Well mine broke out. But i can't claim just.

183
00:22:57,05 --> 00:23:11,61
The communal. Setting. There's lots of affect this. And all of. I mean terms of. Partnership relationships.

184
00:23:11,61 --> 00:23:21,22
And i think any civil. But that's not so unusual and. In it. And these times and. In this area or.

185
00:23:21,22 --> 00:23:27,24
Mistry or whatever anyway. It was and.

186
00:23:27,24 --> 00:23:33,87
It wasn't in terms the relationships of people in this community it wasn't apparent to me that it was a strain.

187
00:23:34,19 --> 00:23:41,43
Well i think for some people who found it. And who weren't.

188
00:23:41,43 --> 00:23:50,35
Building more into it because that's the way they feel they found it more difficult in and unfortunately.

189
00:23:50,35 --> 00:23:57,52
Because i don't really know why but. Which suddenly had a whole lot of babies all at once who.

190
00:23:57,52 --> 00:24:02,75
It meant that the sex role division just got said that women had babies who were breastfeeding and.

191
00:24:02,75 --> 00:24:07,24
So to get them involved in the building was difficult especially because they had to be.

192
00:24:07,99 --> 00:24:14,42
They just didn't seem inclined to pick it up in the same way that. The main expected of them so.

193
00:24:16,49 --> 00:24:23,35
I mean this building we're sitting in the body from community center at the moment and.

194
00:24:23,35 --> 00:24:35,65
I think about five or six years into our sins were established. I suggested to the community that we put aside.

195
00:24:35,65 --> 00:24:40,42
Four months all of us try and sort of stop whatever work we were doing.

196
00:24:40,42 --> 00:24:44,23
To work together on the community center because at the time we were in a shack that we call divine

197
00:24:44,23 --> 00:24:48,54
and it was really beginning to get pretty ashamed of it.

198
00:24:48,54 --> 00:24:52,36
It was very hard to keep clean and to function

199
00:24:52,36 --> 00:24:59,49
and it just wasn't impressive to me any of the many ways it is that it came out why we attracted a lot of messages.

200
00:24:59,55 --> 00:25:05,2
And that's another story in itself it was a multiple occupancy fight and so on

201
00:25:05,2 --> 00:25:08,85
and my part of my dream in that that i did express but.

202
00:25:08,85 --> 00:25:13,37
I don't think was taken on anyway i was that we'd work together on that we take each other building and.

203
00:25:13,37 --> 00:25:20,51
There would be any quality. In how we'd build this building. And unfortunately i was away at the time.

204
00:25:20,51 --> 00:25:25,33
Just for a month or so at the time that. Two or three others got into designing it.

205
00:25:25,33 --> 00:25:29,83
And i designed this building which is beautiful to look at it six sided and.

206
00:25:29,83 --> 00:25:36,28
Has it has a roof with a little put on top and light coming in and. And the kitchens. You know.

207
00:25:36,28 --> 00:25:43,6
Spacious with lots of bench space and so on. Lots of wood. And it's high up with a good view.

208
00:25:43,9 --> 00:25:47,83
But if you look at it it's not an easy building to build if you're nervous build it.

209
00:25:47,83 --> 00:25:53,78
Every joint is an angle in it and you need an expert to tell you what to do which meant.

210
00:25:54,54 --> 00:25:58,71
Which meant that the same old divisions of labor sprang up people feel disempowered.

211
00:25:58,71 --> 00:26:03,93
The ones that didn't i had i really used tools and somewhat used to building filled this in pad

212
00:26:03,93 --> 00:26:10,14
and there was this energy to just get this building built and. I just couldn't. No matter what i said.

213
00:26:10,14 --> 00:26:16,29
I couldn't hold back. In fact. It. And literally happened that i said look. I'm not happy with this design.

214
00:26:16,29 --> 00:26:20,03
And people said no we just want to get on with it more or less rushed out of the little shack

215
00:26:20,03 --> 00:26:25,71
and started going for the system. I couldn't. And. And you know.

216
00:26:25,71 --> 00:26:35,46
Them ones in their typical position of wanting something different but not wanting to put it down on everyone.

217
00:26:35,46 --> 00:26:52,73
A damper on things. And people didn't understand what i was talking about it. Was that point coming from you. And yet.

218
00:26:52,73 --> 00:27:02,38
You know it. You know with the idealism in the early days was a sort of a dog with him.

219
00:27:02,38 --> 00:27:09,29
And a sort of a control of each other and their behavior and we had we had a lot of agreements. For instance.

220
00:27:09,29 --> 00:27:16,41
And these were sort of like rooms. Although there was no sanctions. It was just. What you agreed to and things like.

221
00:27:16,41 --> 00:27:20,4
We had no alcohol no diet. No dogs and cats.

222
00:27:20,4 --> 00:27:28,89
And things that we still hold to social alcohol you know but we also had things like not driving on to the community

223
00:27:28,89 --> 00:27:30,4
and nish absolutely had to.

224
00:27:30,4 --> 00:27:36,18
So that it would be a caffre space all around the house which is lovely but which meant that some people ended up.

225
00:27:36,18 --> 00:27:42,89
You know. Wheel bearing huge wide back and forth along the rides. To their place and.

226
00:27:42,89 --> 00:27:50,08
You know really taking the brunt of a decision. And they were.

227
00:27:50,08 --> 00:27:59,57
There was also unspoken agreements like for some reason in the early days no one had a radio and. We just sort of.

228
00:27:59,57 --> 00:28:04,64
We were so inward looking. So we just want to. To get the same together.

229
00:28:04,73 --> 00:28:09,41
We didn't really want to strike scenes from the outside world i think.

230
00:28:09,41 --> 00:28:14,42
And we went finally one family one of the tavi there was a big divide. Which went on for.

231
00:28:15,09 --> 00:28:20,57
Months until the people wanting the t.v. Got very frustrated and just got one anyway.

232
00:28:20,57 --> 00:28:25,76
And that caused a fuel because some people very attractive.

233
00:28:25,76 --> 00:28:31,03
Attached to the consensus process well you'll have to agree with or anything it was which is generally wonderful.

234
00:28:32,72 --> 00:28:42,16
The consensus process i mean. Is just really like it. But it can lead to a dogmatism. And.

235
00:28:42,16 --> 00:28:47,43
And i don't think that's healthy. I mean when people feel restricted by that sort of thing.

236
00:28:47,43 --> 00:28:53,16
It'll come out sideways when some other way will come out in the future. And some unhealthy way.

237
00:28:53,16 --> 00:28:55,18
Then when this tool is a little bit of.

238
00:28:55,18 --> 00:28:59,93
Well i don't know i mean some people call it dogmatism other people would still call it common sense you know

239
00:28:59,93 --> 00:29:07,51
vegetarianism. I mean that. One man. Not thinking clearly very clearly or something. Just bored.

240
00:29:07,51 --> 00:29:14,41
Little several lawyers for how did the other day. And that upset really upset quite a few other members because they.

241
00:29:14,41 --> 00:29:21,83
Because vegetarian. Is into them means he's part of a caring for life and. So.

242
00:29:21,83 --> 00:29:26,68
Well that i would eating the meat i really feel like. None of us should. You know. On this community. That's.

243
00:29:26,68 --> 00:29:33,28
That's what all the rules are you know like you know made on the community no diet and so on and.

244
00:29:33,28 --> 00:29:39,6
On the community which means that you know technically you can go off and have your sausage in a joint. You know.

245
00:29:39,6 --> 00:29:55,88
Cross the aisle water if you want to strike back in but it's. You know the rules of. Did they more. I see is more of a.

246
00:29:55,88 --> 00:29:57,68
If i guard lines or.

247
00:29:57,68 --> 00:30:03,21
To give someone especially from his coming to the place for the first time an idea of what i value for them

248
00:30:03,21 --> 00:30:08,32
or a set of values. But we did have. We had five precepts as well which move buddhist in origin.

249
00:30:08,32 --> 00:30:17,18
You know killing them and lying. You know taking what is not given. No six that hurts others. No intoxicants.

250
00:30:17,18 --> 00:30:26,09
Or no things that confuse the mind. And i would more guard lines and. Misbehave a venue.

251
00:30:26,09 --> 00:30:31,62
And they're still there and every one of them's been broken. You know.

252
00:30:31,62 --> 00:30:42,85
Yet really really sure exactly exactly so i think there's a relaxed. Feel around. Rules and agreements these days.

253
00:30:42,85 --> 00:30:47,84
And in growing lawrence and so on. You know they're not spoken of much.

254
00:30:48,64 --> 00:30:54,52
They more or less just set the scene or something. And these days.

255
00:30:54,52 --> 00:31:01,09
We i mean we do have a meditation hole in the property of it's very rarely used. Yet there's no.

256
00:31:01,09 --> 00:31:05,57
Schedule or anything like that so it's just if someone wakes up in the morning and. Decides to go meditate.

257
00:31:06,35 --> 00:31:11,2
Now go down there and bang on the gong outside and there's an invitation for any real food join them and one

258
00:31:11,2 --> 00:31:19,96
or two others might total down. And that's it although we're still involved in running meditation retreats and.

259
00:31:19,96 --> 00:31:24,96
Meditation is still very important in some people's lives here but not everyone. But inquiry.

260
00:31:24,96 --> 00:31:27,44
Is still important i would say.

261
00:31:27,44 --> 00:31:32,79
Doesn't have the same intensity that it did in the with that idea of inquiry being important doesn't have the same

262
00:31:32,79 --> 00:31:40,88
intensity as it did. That's still there. And i really value that. Personally.
