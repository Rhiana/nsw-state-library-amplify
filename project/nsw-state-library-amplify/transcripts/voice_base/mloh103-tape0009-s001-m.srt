00:00:21,65 --> 00:00:29,09
Hello my name is bob hopkins. I'm a long time resident of naman. I've.

2
00:00:30,78 --> 00:00:39,58
Came here primarily as a political gesture and as a consequence i continue that these lines of interest within him

3
00:00:39,58 --> 00:00:48,53
and i've been involved in the years with. Name in news. Very active within the newman community school.

4
00:00:49,21 --> 00:00:59,03
In him and a whole committee. Currently. Secretary and public officer of the name and environment center.

5
00:00:59,03 --> 00:01:08,3
Plus a few others. Various organizations associated with it. And presently i'm working at the newman recycling center.

6
00:01:14,82 --> 00:01:18,67
Now look there have been times when i possibly could have fitted that bill but.

7
00:01:18,67 --> 00:01:27,15
One doesn't mind tiny's particular title for terry law.

8
00:01:29,66 --> 00:01:33,8
Well i first came to him in here the year before the festival happened so i knew him

9
00:01:33,8 --> 00:01:42,34
and tended to stand in my mind i was working for a chap in sydney who wanted to set up a primal therapy center in the

10
00:01:42,34 --> 00:01:53,53
country. He was looking for. Undeveloped land. In the real estate agents in leeds moral said undeveloped land the land.

11
00:01:53,53 --> 00:02:02,91
You one named and. So i came to nimbin here in nineteen seventy two. He was very much just a really.

12
00:02:02,91 --> 00:02:09,89
Forgotten little town it was a tan in the middle of a rural decline. Most of the shops are rather empty or.

13
00:02:09,89 --> 00:02:22,18
Being lived in his residence. The. Community was very poor. Run them and people living on not a great deal of income.

14
00:02:22,18 --> 00:02:24,67
They were found societal over the place.

15
00:02:25,42 --> 00:02:35,65
I travelled on from there and returned to lose more the next year's student of the teachers college. And.

16
00:02:35,65 --> 00:02:41,75
As fate would have it i was right on the spot. When the festival happened.

17
00:02:48,8 --> 00:02:57,2
Well yeah it's interesting in a sort of historical perspective. We. My wife and myself were both pretty young.

18
00:02:57,2 --> 00:03:09,22
At right. My son was born on the second day of the festival and.

19
00:03:09,22 --> 00:03:19,45
My wife and i were both pretty young at that time pretty unsure about doing it by ourselves. We.

20
00:03:19,45 --> 00:03:25,41
From the point of view of the fact that birth and beyond is a home birth organizations existed now.

21
00:03:25,41 --> 00:03:37,66
In name been for the last seventeen years. It's interesting to makes it an interesting. Time capsule.

22
00:03:37,66 --> 00:03:44,87
We tried to get a doctor or a midwife at that time to attend. The.

23
00:03:44,87 --> 00:03:51,62
But found it very difficult so we went to the northern star and advertised for a doctor a midwife

24
00:03:51,62 --> 00:03:56,03
and at that stage they wouldn't accept the ad because it was considered to be

25
00:03:56,03 --> 00:04:04,55
and i was saying it's interesting in light of all the changes that are going on around the area that these.

26
00:04:04,55 --> 00:04:13,04
It gives an interesting. Sense of the passing of time and the changes that have been wrought by this is saudi.

27
00:04:19,08 --> 00:04:21,18
The first of all the fact that the tanning.

28
00:04:21,18 --> 00:04:30,15
A pretty fundamental way because what it meant was that the people at lot of the people who came here decided to stay.

29
00:04:30,15 --> 00:04:39,64
It's a beautiful area land was cheap land was plentiful. And the feeling was so good at the festival that.

30
00:04:39,64 --> 00:04:49,87
A lot of people wish to maintain that sense of satisfaction. The festival itself was also. Can see.

31
00:04:49,87 --> 00:05:02,2
As an ongoing festival it wasn't it. It was part of a series of biennials festivals that.

32
00:05:02,2 --> 00:05:08,9
Were run by the national union of union of history and university students. And were story into.

33
00:05:09,62 --> 00:05:12,58
What had happened in the past was that festivals.

34
00:05:12,58 --> 00:05:19,84
Tended to set up for a couple of weeks people would hang their paintings. A few drama or activities would go on.

35
00:05:19,84 --> 00:05:20,48
But this one.

36
00:05:20,48 --> 00:05:23,02
And then at the end everyone would pack up and go away

37
00:05:23,02 --> 00:05:27,49
but with this one it was conceived as an ongoing festival of lifestyle.

38
00:05:29,09 --> 00:05:34,77
And that's exactly what happened in the why i see it is that the festival. Has never really stopped.

39
00:05:34,77 --> 00:05:45,4
It's been an ongoing. Twenty year. Exercise in people seeking to bring about a fundamental change in the law stalls.

40
00:05:45,4 --> 00:05:57,86
Community politics. The why that people relate to each other and to the environment particularly. And it still goes on.

41
00:05:57,86 --> 00:06:06,92
It's still happening all the time it's got a remarkable sort of history of. Achievements behind it now.

42
00:06:06,92 --> 00:06:16,86
In things as diverse as. Well birth and beyond popularizing home birth. And empowering women along the why.

43
00:06:16,86 --> 00:06:25,91
The changes in the multiple occupancy laws that were one of the first changes in ten years for very long time.

44
00:06:25,91 --> 00:06:36,3
Environmental political thrust that came from here that started and. Culminated in the terai forest.

45
00:06:36,3 --> 00:06:45,87
Protests the man in the forest protests that just went on to other areas as people realize the environmental.

46
00:06:45,87 --> 00:06:57,83
Imperatives. The alternative energy. Lobby has been particularly persistent here.

47
00:06:57,83 --> 00:07:10,9
Which is resulted in the formation of the rainbow power company. The music that is coming out of here has been a times.

48
00:07:10,9 --> 00:07:24,24
Most particularly name been. Which is again reflected the attitudes. In the last star through the music.

49
00:07:24,24 --> 00:07:49,6
Do you know what else happened. The last twenty. What is particularly bad naman. Is a larry can.

50
00:07:49,6 --> 00:07:51,77
A particularly larry king a straggly

51
00:07:51,77 --> 00:08:05,02
and tendency to seek to go through what people consider to be appropriate within themselves.

52
00:08:05,02 --> 00:08:31,09
You know why that's full of a combination of humor. Political confrontation. That are reflected a creative.

53
00:08:31,09 --> 00:08:39,4
That was most manifest in the culture through the music. In the nineteen seventies music.

54
00:08:39,4 --> 00:08:46,51
Was a real powerful cultural force it's become absorbed more and more by the industry over the years.

55
00:08:46,51 --> 00:09:07,8
But the music in women is remind. There's always been within within him been a tendency to express the un ings for.

56
00:09:07,8 --> 00:09:20,73
Community. For the in the magic of the life and earth by spirituality through the music. Yeah it's not really my forte.

57
00:09:20,73 --> 00:09:43,15
But. A lot of people have moved on.

58
00:09:43,15 --> 00:09:45,52
For a lot of different reasons out of frustration

59
00:09:45,52 --> 00:09:52,17
and maybe that they haven't achieved what they thought they were going to or maybe the fan that their.

60
00:09:52,17 --> 00:09:58,44
Their actual life. Doesn't necessarily correspond with the original dream.

61
00:09:58,44 --> 00:10:05,96
But a lot of people have studied the communities of continue to grow and strengthen and expand and developing and.

62
00:10:07,28 --> 00:10:18,84
Unwise that serve a particular nade of the people who are here. For me. Nimbin was a political possibility.

63
00:10:18,84 --> 00:10:24,72
Or it offered the opportunity for a political possibility that we touched upon.

64
00:10:24,97 --> 00:10:35,31
I guess in the sixty's during the times of the viet nam conflict. And all that was associated with that.

65
00:10:35,31 --> 00:10:42,34
And it seemed as though naman was a place where it was possible to actually create some sort of new society which was

66
00:10:42,34 --> 00:10:49,94
based upon this new alternative way of thinking. And it does.

67
00:10:49,94 --> 00:11:00,26
It offers these possibilities it continues to offer these possibilities. Because naman is a media. Nine. Nationally.

68
00:11:00,26 --> 00:11:06,92
People will notice things that come out of the name and. The initiatives.

69
00:11:06,92 --> 00:11:11,26
In all realms of sort of political and community life.

70
00:11:13,22 --> 00:11:21,56
The ability to make people who are interested in working in the same areas as you are out of the particular and they.

71
00:11:21,56 --> 00:11:30,79
For instance through the community school. In other areas it was difficult to establish. Systems of alternative.

72
00:11:30,79 --> 00:11:43,17
Schooling because of the. Small numbers of people in name than. With the prevailing social situation which.

73
00:11:43,17 --> 00:11:48,87
Didn't allow a great deal for the children of the new settlers.

74
00:11:48,87 --> 00:11:56,55
The tendency to want to create an expression of an alternative education system.

75
00:11:56,55 --> 00:12:06,69
Was able to succeed simply because of the. Large numbers of people who were in the area. And who desired this.

76
00:12:06,69 --> 00:12:13,04
Like a lot of other things. Societies chinese diver the. Since then and a lot of the initiatives that was.

77
00:12:13,19 --> 00:12:20,24
Out of that the community school have now been absorbed into the central school system.

78
00:12:22,15 --> 00:12:28,68
And while the community school still manages to exist it doesn't have the same.

79
00:12:32,04 --> 00:12:42,75
Support that it once did have this could be a combination of providing a lot changes in people's attitude towards

80
00:12:42,75 --> 00:12:44,87
schooling.

81
00:12:44,87 --> 00:12:59,74
But i think to a large extent it is it's kemah bad as a consequence to the chinese that have been forged by comparison

82
00:12:59,74 --> 00:13:03,97
with the providing system. Or by this. The providing system.

83
00:13:03,97 --> 00:13:10,42
Looking at what we were doing at the community school and altering their approach in order to accommodate more.

84
00:13:10,42 --> 00:13:23,91
The alternative came up the alternative education thrust.

85
00:13:34,08 --> 00:13:39,41
Twenty's is a long time a lot of changes happen in twenty years twenty years ago women weren't allowed in public

86
00:13:39,41 --> 00:13:49,94
but society has undergone a huge transformation during that period of time.

87
00:13:49,94 --> 00:13:57,97
Organic agriculture is now being recognised as being an almost imperative for australian farmers.

88
00:13:57,97 --> 00:14:23,27
The senses of environmental. Imperatives of also chinese. Niman is almost bought about. I mean mina's.

89
00:14:23,27 --> 00:14:28,82
Newman has manifested. What it said have to do. In the sense of.

90
00:14:28,82 --> 00:14:36,21
Putting a series of particular issues into the public consciousness. This is where the challenge laws the name and.

91
00:14:36,21 --> 00:14:48,00
To be able to look at the next twenty years. And lie down a vision that will hold for that will. In twenty years time.

92
00:14:48,00 --> 00:15:00,76
Be considered as being pertinent. And fundamental to nature of society. But there is also a longer.

93
00:15:00,76 --> 00:15:06,1
I'm that is there the original. Aquarius festival.

94
00:15:06,1 --> 00:15:11,76
Concentrated on a sense of tribes and community in relation to the environment.

95
00:15:11,76 --> 00:15:15,29
And this is one of the things that continues to attract me here and.

96
00:15:15,29 --> 00:15:20,27
And what i see is happening is that there is a particular culture being formed.

97
00:15:20,27 --> 00:15:25,29
For the earth to be sustainable that needs a sense of. Tribalism.

98
00:15:25,29 --> 00:15:31,27
Of people who have grown up in a particular area who are committed to living in a particular area.

99
00:15:31,27 --> 00:15:43,34
Who get to know the area. Intimately. Who forge an ongoing. Culture. That takes into account.

100
00:15:43,34 --> 00:15:57,65
The area in which you leave. And. I guess the in the long run. The value of name and will be saying.

101
00:15:57,65 --> 00:16:01,94
After a two or three generations and.

102
00:16:01,94 --> 00:16:07,46
It's only then really that naman will be able to be saying whether

103
00:16:07,46 --> 00:16:13,04
or not we've created a society that is equal to the top.

104
00:16:13,29 --> 00:16:27,67
The twenty year periods are useful in so far as that they do provide a measuring point of health. We've come.

105
00:16:27,67 --> 00:16:35,73
But there is still. The challenge there for us to continue to put into effect.

106
00:16:37,5 --> 00:16:42,86
Whatever the vision ease at any one particular point of time so much time is spent.

107
00:16:42,86 --> 00:16:51,67
Just holding ground against the forces that are out there that would potentially overrun.

108
00:16:51,67 --> 00:17:05,05
This point of view that exists here in him and. And so as a consequence. There are a lot of areas of social life that.

109
00:17:05,05 --> 00:17:08,21
A possibly lacking in terms of the vision.

110
00:17:10,87 --> 00:17:21,79
We've currently got the situation in town where people are getting upset about the state of. Street behavior.

111
00:17:21,79 --> 00:17:36,05
And drug related issues. And this is an area where. Which i see is very pertinent to the whole idea of name and.

112
00:17:36,05 --> 00:17:46,91
It seems fundamental to me that. Nima needs to rise to this to confront. The problem of drugs. In this society.

113
00:17:47,3 --> 00:17:53,55
And look at it in a new why. Implement new directions. Rather than resorting to.

114
00:17:55,35 --> 00:18:06,48
The old wise but it's very difficult to step outside. The dominant. Thinking forms in. And actually implement change.

115
00:18:06,48 --> 00:18:23,22
And change that are in relation to the to the drug. Issues in name and. What we need is a. I radical.

116
00:18:23,22 --> 00:18:33,17
Reappraisal of the drug situation how it affects us to look at what it's doing to our society.

117
00:18:33,17 --> 00:18:45,93
And trying to create some new form of. Approach to the whole the issue of drug use. To do this.

118
00:18:45,93 --> 00:19:00,46
We really need to step outside. The whole of the dominant society. And forget the particular lor's.

119
00:19:00,46 --> 00:19:10,66
And create almost in a theatrical form a new scenario a new paradigm for. Possibility.

120
00:19:12,33 --> 00:19:19,84
Marijuana has been associated with naman. Pretty much right from the start.

121
00:19:19,84 --> 00:19:35,58
As it was a substance that was taken out by the early hippies. And it was one of the as. It does become a sacrament.

122
00:19:35,58 --> 00:19:41,32
In those early days. It still does have this aspect about it.

123
00:19:41,32 --> 00:19:49,23
But what's happened over the course of time is that the price for this particular substance. Has risen alarmingly.

124
00:19:51,2 --> 00:19:59,07
And because it has such a cash value. It was one of the first things that people stop sharing.

125
00:19:59,07 --> 00:20:11,11
Where they are able to reenter into the. Consumption by society without having to commit a large slice of your life.

126
00:20:11,11 --> 00:20:16,86
To working in offices or working. For corporations or working in business and call the us.

127
00:20:20,21 --> 00:20:26,17
And although it is seen to be part of the freedom of nimon it is part of the reason.

128
00:20:26,17 --> 00:20:36,37
Why naman is selling the seeds of its destruction and this to me just. Pinpoint even more directly.

129
00:20:37,14 --> 00:20:41,81
The imperative for china in this direction.

130
00:20:50,89 --> 00:21:02,78
Within the drug issue particularly at the moment in niman vast sums of money.

131
00:21:03,46 --> 00:21:15,82
In at the moment in nimbin large amounts of money. Transferred between people in the sile. Of marijuana.

132
00:21:16,83 --> 00:21:28,06
None of this money. Returns itself to the general community it goes always to individual people.

133
00:21:28,06 --> 00:21:36,52
If in name and we could regulate. The silo of marijuana in much the same way that it happens.

134
00:21:36,52 --> 00:21:47,97
The best model for where it is happening is in holland with marijuana has a sort of quasi legal stuff as.

135
00:21:47,97 --> 00:21:58,58
Marijuana in holland has a quasi legal status. Where it's sold in. Coffee shops. It's taxed.

136
00:22:00,14 --> 00:22:13,04
And the responsibility is on the actual seller. To make sure that they have that i take responsibility.

137
00:22:13,5 --> 00:22:19,86
Because the fact that they're involved in selling an intoxicating substance.

138
00:22:20,01 --> 00:22:30,49
If we were able to do the same thing in women. We would have. The people who sorry.

139
00:22:30,9 --> 00:22:39,87
Let's just give a scenario of a possible change. If we had. The run by a cafe for instance. Selling pot.

140
00:22:39,87 --> 00:22:50,96
Over the cantar then. What we could do would be to undercut the street price. Which would eliminate the hustle.

141
00:22:50,96 --> 00:22:55,5
That happens on the street. But eliminates the competitiveness of the volunteers.

142
00:22:55,92 --> 00:23:06,32
He would take away the possibility for the. Sort of parasitical chemical. Heroin's the cocaine sellers that.

143
00:23:06,32 --> 00:23:12,87
Are attracted by the. The large amounts of money. By the illegality.

144
00:23:12,87 --> 00:23:29,8
By the fact that there is an element of opposition to the lords. And these people have been bleeding.

145
00:23:29,8 --> 00:23:45,46
The community drawing. If we had the right back half way. Selling it then i could. It would be.

146
00:23:45,46 --> 00:23:50,4
I conceive of if the rainbow cafe was selling. Part of the cantar.

147
00:23:50,4 --> 00:23:57,48
Then i would take on a responsibility for administering the whole saying it would be up to them. To make sure that the.

148
00:24:01,1 --> 00:24:07,28
On the sort of congestion or that there isn't the sort of congestion. That exists in front of the rind.

149
00:24:07,28 --> 00:24:14,67
Cafe the hustling. The dealing that upsets and out rises to a speech that is. Local the lawyer.

150
00:24:18,53 --> 00:24:29,33
At the moment alcohol is solved without any responsibility being placed on the dispenses of alcohol.

151
00:24:29,33 --> 00:24:41,34
To really look up to the people that. The alcohol the fakes that they sell to. I would say that. Pubs.

152
00:24:41,34 --> 00:24:49,87
Should be able to or should be night to provide childcare centers. Social workers. People who just.

153
00:24:49,87 --> 00:24:54,07
Mingle with the crowds make sure that nobody who is looking like they are becoming drunk

154
00:24:54,07 --> 00:25:05,41
and becoming a problem to themselves and to the society. Should not be allowed to procure any more alcohol.

155
00:25:05,41 --> 00:25:18,13
In the same way. Apply the same line of reasoning to marijuana silos. The people whose dispense. The drugs should be.

156
00:25:18,13 --> 00:25:28,72
My to be. To be held responsible for the consequences of what goes down. Following the marijuana. Silos. At the moment.

157
00:25:28,72 --> 00:25:39,4
Because the whole thing. Has an illegal status. It's outside the realm of society to really regulate. We.

158
00:25:39,4 --> 00:25:44,61
You can have the police come in and pick off a few dealers.

159
00:25:46,43 --> 00:25:52,41
But by the time that they have worked their way through the mountain of pipe or the fingerprinting.

160
00:25:52,41 --> 00:26:01,28
Identification the photo was. Another. Two people could easily have joined the street sellers by that time.

161
00:26:02,3 --> 00:26:08,11
And at the end of the day the people who've been arrested are just back on the streets and dealing again.

162
00:26:08,11 --> 00:26:14,48
It's just that the. The war on drugs approach. Has and would. Can any country in the world.

163
00:26:15,24 --> 00:26:20,34
In fact it's being can a productive in the sime why that is being can a productive here.

164
00:26:21,46 --> 00:26:29,17
There is a disproportionate sense of values. Being put down to the young people.

165
00:26:30,65 --> 00:26:37,61
A week's work can be yielded three hundred dollars banan support can potentially yield you four hundred

166
00:26:37,61 --> 00:26:45,34
or five hundred dollars. It's promoted.

167
00:26:45,34 --> 00:26:57,54
Suspicion between people because all of the fact that your own party is likely to be ripped off. Saul on the streets.

168
00:26:57,54 --> 00:27:04,55
You there's no way you can try said there's no protection that you have. So people tend to be counted suspicious of.

169
00:27:04,55 --> 00:27:12,33
As everyone. Paranoid. Potentially even sort of heading in the direction of.

170
00:27:13,55 --> 00:27:19,92
Taken violent measures to protect their crops these are the drug problems when they. Ripple through a big drug problem.

171
00:27:20,24 --> 00:27:32,52
Not necessarily the. The street saying. Which in a lot of cases. Doesn't necessarily relight. To drugs.

172
00:27:32,52 --> 00:27:41,79
But as i've heard with drugs because of the types of people who come looking for an easy way to make money.

173
00:27:41,79 --> 00:27:48,76
And they see society where things are a bit more open and tolerated.

174
00:27:48,76 --> 00:28:09,69
Than any other parts of a struggle that i've been candid. Nimbin regularly used to haul these. Anti heroin.

175
00:28:09,69 --> 00:28:17,78
Matings as heroin has sort of risen from time to. Time into a state of prominence and.

176
00:28:17,78 --> 00:28:32,03
Pretty widespread use throughout the town. And public meetings have been held at two or three year intervals.

177
00:28:32,65 --> 00:28:42,17
At which time. It was more of an opportunity for people to vent their anger. Their frustration.

178
00:28:42,17 --> 00:28:54,38
Generally to attack the police for not doing enough. Attack. Indiscriminately. Or uses. No matter what they were using.

179
00:28:55,88 --> 00:29:04,06
It did nothing really to bring a bad a sense of progress or harmony.

180
00:29:05,44 --> 00:29:13,47
So myself i started to notice that people started to believe what others said about their particular habits.

181
00:29:13,47 --> 00:29:18,49
Marijuana users tended to actually become to feel that they were somehow

182
00:29:18,49 --> 00:29:27,05
or other the outcast of society that they were a criminal it diminished their own sense of self esteem.

183
00:29:27,05 --> 00:29:39,46
Their own sense of being their own sense of value in law. And so i figured that. The time had come when.

184
00:29:39,46 --> 00:29:51,14
I just had to try and bring about a chinese because the more that people felt victimized by the.

185
00:29:51,14 --> 00:29:53,87
The anti drug feelings.

186
00:29:56,55 --> 00:30:05,39
The the less that are likely to apply an active role in determining the future of their own society that is more.

187
00:30:05,39 --> 00:30:18,29
They were more likely to keep out of society. Try and. God. Sources of income through ground part.

188
00:30:18,29 --> 00:30:28,86
Which really didn't do a great deal to wards. Making this a better society or better community to leaving.

189
00:30:28,86 --> 00:30:44,31
And so i i stepped out from the cover of anonymity. To take on the drug lords.

190
00:30:44,31 --> 00:30:53,01
Which in itself is pretty fascinating because the. The whole nature of drug use in societies.

191
00:30:53,01 --> 00:31:10,06
Has implications and repercussions right throughout. So many structure of law and. I stood for parliament. Last years.

192
00:31:10,06 --> 00:31:25,45
Being on a. I stood. Parliament last year on a drug reform ticket. Ok. Yeah. I nine tined.

193
00:31:31,45 --> 00:31:36,05
Up to the last big heroin meeting which was held in nineteen ninety. I formed a group e.

194
00:31:36,05 --> 00:31:40,28
A cool million normal nimbin which was a bit of a pun based.
