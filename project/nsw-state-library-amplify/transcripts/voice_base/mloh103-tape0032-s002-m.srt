1
00:00:16,46 --> 00:00:22,16
And we must take back the profession of healing.

2
00:00:22,16 --> 00:00:26,47
From science because you see it's medical science is not healing profusion.

3
00:00:26,47 --> 00:00:32,89
It's a profession which manages it seems to me. In the body. And that's not healing and.

4
00:00:32,89 --> 00:00:39,77
I don't believe in healing because they believe in it in the context of. Wounds healing for example. But that.

5
00:00:39,77 --> 00:00:48,13
There is a healing. Intelligence within the body. Which can be a stude by natural me to sins.

6
00:00:48,13 --> 00:00:57,35
Who is totally outside of the science and the realm of experience. But then i feel that because of the.

7
00:00:57,35 --> 00:01:03,14
Orthodoxy of the training. I have the rot. To pass judgment on. A natural clear petes.

8
00:01:03,14 --> 00:01:06,67
It's almost not like you i have a god given right it's not being him

9
00:01:06,67 --> 00:01:12,36
or not you know you have a god given right to rule. Because if you will do in your place in society.

10
00:01:12,36 --> 00:01:19,98
And it i have no qualms about exiting match. Role and. I don't think i will.

11
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:29,93
I don't know that i'm not to speak to you say to you that the doing the right thing by society they certainly are not

12
00:01:29,93 --> 00:01:35,17
supposed to have to justify the. Sixty thousand dollars or whatever it is even.

13
00:01:35,17 --> 00:01:44,15
By continuing to be going into bureaucrats and. Create regulations and need to slash and it's.

14
00:01:44,15 --> 00:02:04,96
I mean what would we do with them. Nor do i think natural medicines would look well.

15
00:02:04,96 --> 00:02:10,68
What people forget is that human beings are part of nature. That really have a goal. On this clangers.

16
00:02:10,68 --> 00:02:20,74
Along with all the plants and all the enemy. And the atmosphere in the water. The minerals. Together and.

17
00:02:20,74 --> 00:02:29,55
Consequently when she laughs you. Still laugh systems and.

18
00:02:29,55 --> 00:02:34,99
It's something that four million news human beings leave on this planet.

19
00:02:34,99 --> 00:02:43,12
And we're not you know coolants with the natural. Cycles of the seasons and the things that grew.

20
00:02:43,12 --> 00:02:51,75
So it has developed us. We haven't developed. And now. We totally cut off from that and we don't leave.

21
00:02:51,75 --> 00:02:59,7
Within a natural cycle. We for example. It seems only ran it should only be in for a short time with you like tomatoes.

22
00:02:59,7 --> 00:03:04,27
Very irritating. To the system and. A lot of people are allergic to them.

23
00:03:04,27 --> 00:03:10,21
And yet we expect them to have them on a table in the dative when test. And often.

24
00:03:10,21 --> 00:03:15,29
We totally out of touch with our bodies we get messages that we completely missing to produce and we ignore.

25
00:03:15,57 --> 00:03:25,8
We don't know what to do. When we get them. Don't know how to heal that's. We've broken away from nature.

26
00:03:25,8 --> 00:03:35,34
And the system which grew us and naresh to us and use the tecate to bring us back to it. A healthy state. We've lost.

27
00:03:35,34 --> 00:03:36,86
Lost it.

28
00:03:36,86 --> 00:03:45,4
And i mean even in the early parts of the century there was a lot of knowledge you cite me to some people couldn't

29
00:03:45,4 --> 00:03:52,56
afford to go to doctors that a lot of people knew how to heal themselves with foods and who raced in.

30
00:03:52,56 --> 00:04:01,09
Things like that that we have lost. And it to me a big part of natural. Pieces the.

31
00:04:01,09 --> 00:04:09,43
Education the read you cation of people in the traditional. Grass roots medicine which is very. I think to even useful.

32
00:04:09,43 --> 00:04:19,61
And people need it. Nowadays people get you.

33
00:04:19,61 --> 00:04:20,73
And i want to go somewhere

34
00:04:20,73 --> 00:04:27,52
and take a pill get a pill that will enable him to stop it we create sample i don't want to take five days off in reste

35
00:04:27,52 --> 00:04:34,96
and maybe faster a couple of days and just hang. Vegetables and fruit and.

36
00:04:34,96 --> 00:04:38,13
Retreating to themselves and think about the.

37
00:04:38,13 --> 00:04:42,17
Stresses in the life direction and why they get in you and things like that.

38
00:04:42,17 --> 00:04:47,07
I just want to ignore that totally and take a pill and have it will go away.

39
00:04:47,07 --> 00:04:54,25
And the medical profession has encouraged the martially. In that response because that's where the health dollar yes.

40
00:04:54,25 --> 00:05:02,28
That's what it's all the bad to the name. They want that responsibility. They want people to come to the complaint.

41
00:05:04,36 --> 00:05:09,98
Online now the health system is getting i well with people who have been conditioned to do exactly that and now.

42
00:05:09,98 --> 00:05:15,84
Just the other day i heard it on the radio that they wanted to encourage people to think before they go to the doctor

43
00:05:15,84 --> 00:05:18,07
about whether the a complaint is really a trivial one

44
00:05:18,07 --> 00:05:23,72
and they might be able to take care of it themselves because the system is getting either way and.

45
00:05:33,88 --> 00:05:43,16
The spiritual side of healing well. You know since theories no spiritual side of healing because if you always do.

46
00:05:43,16 --> 00:05:51,26
Practitioner the reason i do fusion. Mind body and spirit or into it was even through a recent.

47
00:05:51,39 --> 00:06:02,23
And add being so high that you dispute your component you will need that and lodge bell component to your thoughts.

48
00:06:03,73 --> 00:06:07,52
So that people don't for example imagine that you can treat depression.

49
00:06:07,52 --> 00:06:09,46
Three natural medicine

50
00:06:09,46 --> 00:06:17,32
but you can just the same as if you treating physical complaints you often have to get into the emotional i speak till.

51
00:06:17,32 --> 00:06:25,45
Them so they really isn't any division and. But we really stuck with the mind body split.

52
00:06:25,97 --> 00:06:30,11
Which again is sort of developed in the last three hundred years. Through.

53
00:06:30,11 --> 00:06:37,88
County asian philosophy three being really locked into the physical. That stan ye we explode for three hundred years.

54
00:06:37,88 --> 00:06:47,14
And we need just this century studying to explore. The mind without infringe proficiency of psychiatry and psychology.

55
00:06:48,55 --> 00:06:54,14
And even people who are involved in natural medicine don't really realize a lot of the time.

56
00:06:54,14 --> 00:06:58,56
I get clients that come to me who just want people to fix the problem so that it can go away

57
00:06:58,56 --> 00:07:01,59
and they can get back to work and i think that the.

58
00:07:01,59 --> 00:07:09,08
Practicing opportunity of medicine by doing that but they don't realize. Really what holistic medicine. Means.

59
00:07:09,08 --> 00:07:21,94
On a personal level. But getting back to spiritual healing.

60
00:07:23,42 --> 00:07:28,63
They certainly use such thing as spiritual healing in a way people. Achieve healing through.

61
00:07:28,63 --> 00:07:42,05
Lying on of hands through premier through meditation. And really the talk of healing has to suit the pearson you can't.

62
00:07:42,05 --> 00:07:49,39
Force a person to take up a particular approach to healing people have to do what they feel is right for the name.

63
00:07:49,39 --> 00:07:59,45
And then of course they do. So that's why you know and the wonderful thing really about is trying to use that that.

64
00:07:59,45 --> 00:08:06,96
We have pretty much freedom of choice. We think what type of medicine we are in child providing we can afford it.

65
00:08:06,96 --> 00:08:10,1
Is germane to sort of financial discrimination against.

66
00:08:10,1 --> 00:08:15,81
Natural therapies because people have to pay for the math of the package. But the fact is that they do.

67
00:08:16,33 --> 00:08:22,6
I mean they support. A growing. Natural therapies industry.

68
00:08:22,6 --> 00:08:28,19
And of their own pockets and it's now is to my good to be with. I dunno half a billion dollars a year.

69
00:08:28,19 --> 00:08:33,83
She was trying to get that was a figure that the australian natural therapist association came up with.

70
00:08:34,83 --> 00:08:41,13
And that includes. Not any consultations but. When the manufacturing side of it. For example.

71
00:08:41,13 --> 00:08:52,34
Health food store was a huge and growing industry which is beginning to have an impact on our economy. So i think that.

72
00:08:52,34 --> 00:09:01,27
We must retain that choice we have to have all types of healing available to people from spiritual healing to natural

73
00:09:01,27 --> 00:09:11,92
medicine to orthodox. Scientific medicine. And it is a place for all of them. Certainly because of manu singhvi.

74
00:09:11,92 --> 00:09:18,18
Grandon pretty familiar with what orthodox medicine. Can achieve and i would never say. We must not have it.

75
00:09:18,18 --> 00:09:25,44
But it's place really. It's dramatic medicine it's acute medicine it's risk you. Emergency.

76
00:09:25,44 --> 00:09:33,61
It deals with things when they've gotten so out of hand. That the posts not chi nor anyone else. Capable of healing.

77
00:09:33,88 --> 00:09:40,62
And you get stuck to that role that would be great but it strives to state being to situations and. There are so many.

78
00:09:40,62 --> 00:09:46,78
You know chronic in suffolk you complaints which are amenable to healing. But that people when they go to war the dogs.

79
00:09:46,78 --> 00:09:58,82
Me to sing. Don't get healing they get management. Which involves taking drugs. Maybe for the rest of your life.

80
00:09:58,82 --> 00:10:04,95
And while they may sustain you a lot for some time with that they actually take years off your life

81
00:10:04,95 --> 00:10:15,69
and launching into question what the quality of your life is is another mattia and. It also takes that takes. You.

82
00:10:15,69 --> 00:10:24,32
The prospect of healing. Away. Takes responsibility for the individual for the health. Away.

83
00:10:28,49 --> 00:10:35,02
But the face of all kinds of medicine is changing dramatically you know straight in and it's very exciting.

84
00:10:43,37 --> 00:10:51,13
He's mentally onus. Probably the most interesting development in that area would be with the.

85
00:10:51,13 --> 00:10:58,62
Sorry orthomolecular medicine. Which is a branch of. Orthodox medicine. But they only use.

86
00:11:01,95 --> 00:11:06,9
What i described as natural medicines like vitamins and minerals for example.

87
00:11:07,91 --> 00:11:17,17
And they realize that they do rely on science for the. And the foundings. Research.

88
00:11:17,17 --> 00:11:22,37
Said that most of the things they practice could have been backed up by research so that's another interesting

89
00:11:22,37 --> 00:11:32,19
development within the ranks of. Orthodox medicine. As far as natural therapies are consumed.

90
00:11:32,19 --> 00:11:39,16
And then their role in the. It into mental illness. I don't think a lot of natural therapists treat.

91
00:11:39,16 --> 00:11:45,72
Serious mental illnesses. You know that. The sort of groups that have psychotic manifestations.

92
00:11:47,18 --> 00:11:58,09
But certainly amongst the. The neurotic. Therapy used at that sorry. Disorders there's probably a fee.

93
00:11:58,09 --> 00:12:06,58
Representation of natural therapies and by that i would include things like. Psychology which is a natural therapy.

94
00:12:06,58 --> 00:12:15,54
Rebirthing. Various therapies. Apartment and mineral therapy.

95
00:12:15,54 --> 00:12:24,6
A lot of people go to natural therapists for stressed and sleeplessness. Anxieties. Things like bad.

96
00:12:24,86 --> 00:12:29,01
So then we're kind of monday and day to day.

97
00:12:29,01 --> 00:12:47,45
Emotional disorders astute and they approached by natural therapies but the most serious ones. On the home. So.

98
00:12:47,45 --> 00:12:55,73
Yes touch is really important and healing. In a lot of people go to natural therapists who do body would.

99
00:12:55,73 --> 00:13:02,07
On a regular basis because. Often it's the only sort of touching that they get. And this.

100
00:13:02,07 --> 00:13:10,08
This particular theme has really been taken up within the new singh profession. For example say with. Paper.

101
00:13:10,12 --> 00:13:20,3
You know singing hymns and the recognition that they are very deprived of physical contact. So that they you know.

102
00:13:20,3 --> 00:13:25,94
Increasingly with the news sometimes for example there are programs to incorporate message.

103
00:13:27,9 --> 00:13:37,62
Reflexology a rhyme a series things like that that include. That have deiced on touch.

104
00:13:40,9 --> 00:13:46,48
I guess a lot of that just goes back to the sort of society that we live in we have a lot of conflict

105
00:13:46,48 --> 00:13:51,64
and confusion iran and the body. Touch.

106
00:13:51,64 --> 00:14:02,57
Sick surely she said it was natural to be certainly plays a new role in providing match was

107
00:14:02,57 --> 00:14:09,67
and that's been a difficult thing for the message to do because three example you often get confused with people who

108
00:14:09,67 --> 00:14:23,4
provide. Six you'll seuss's. To some people when. You know it. From the public perception. Messages a sexual event.

109
00:14:24,71 --> 00:14:33,69
And yet that's not what most bodywear can see themselves as providing they are honest the way i would look at it is

110
00:14:33,69 --> 00:14:40,73
that there's a big difference between its. Sensuality and touch. And six you ality.

111
00:14:40,73 --> 00:14:49,8
Their different sort of things going on. And and touch. I mean it still can be. Through its sensuality.

112
00:14:49,8 --> 00:14:57,74
Through the magnetic transference of energy. Through its counterfeiting. Can be extremely healing.

113
00:14:57,95 --> 00:15:04,87
And that's a very different thing from the sort of that six woman things that one gets from sitting on the tops of them.

114
00:15:06,47 --> 00:15:08,41
People who provide physical say this is.

115
00:15:11,32 --> 00:15:16,98
We don't differentiate between those sorts of things very easily we haven't talked about it in the neck culture and.

116
00:15:16,98 --> 00:15:20,85
Message wasn't a part of their culture. Prior to a few decades ago.

117
00:15:22,36 --> 00:15:30,89
And i think it's sort of part of that the freeing up of the whole body thing. Basically in a society which.

118
00:15:30,89 --> 00:15:37,55
I think is very important and. It's going through all kinds of. Phases.

119
00:15:37,55 --> 00:15:43,54
In its manifestation some of them quite horrible.

120
00:15:48,97 --> 00:15:54,51
But it's you know i think basically it's really necessary that we free up a lot of area to choose to the body.

121
00:15:55,02 --> 00:16:14,29
They've being making it's on all sorts of levels. Will sink she realities to something we can't sleep or a dash.

122
00:16:14,29 --> 00:16:23,46
You know we have. I mean we've been repressed that it's been taboo for a long time and now it's.

123
00:16:23,46 --> 00:16:38,12
Emerging as a very positive and being in something that we need to explore and heal. And you know.

124
00:16:38,12 --> 00:16:45,11
As i said it's just do. I think it's a nice theory part of the whole kind of taking responsibility for one's healing.

125
00:16:45,11 --> 00:16:52,83
Thing and. For example sexual issues are responsible for a lot of marriage breaks that. Break ups.

126
00:16:52,83 --> 00:16:56,56
Because people go into sexual relationships with so many of knowledge.

127
00:16:56,56 --> 00:17:06,58
That especially when you young sadly experienced and. They can be different state ing people. And we don't do enough.

128
00:17:06,58 --> 00:17:12,71
Teaching of those sorts of things you know nice young people. And all of that.

129
00:17:12,71 --> 00:17:20,94
Those issues are really fruit because they become bound up with moral. Into pretensions of reality.

130
00:17:21,77 --> 00:17:38,1
And we don't have a simple straightforward. Comfortable. Experience without bodies a lot of the town. Rituals.

131
00:17:41,58 --> 00:17:50,71
I mean tombs of. Groups in tombs of which shops. Just relating to sick she reality.

132
00:17:51,82 --> 00:18:02,64
There's some of that sort of healing with it going on in this syria. There are means groups in which shops happening.

133
00:18:02,64 --> 00:18:10,7
Within the context of rebasing. For example as a therapy sexual issues often come up for people with those kind of.

134
00:18:11,28 --> 00:18:17,94
Psychological therapies like that part of the issues they're really fundamental to a lot of people's problems and.

135
00:18:17,94 --> 00:18:19,01
So they can that.

136
00:18:19,01 --> 00:18:25,17
And use theory which she see advertised around from challenging time on a stick she reality and relationships.

137
00:18:25,17 --> 00:18:35,13
It's not my particular area so i don't know a lot about how those which shops around. But c.s. They do a coup.

138
00:18:35,13 --> 00:19:02,18
Whether it's more in this area than in the big cities i don't know maybe not. I think it. I think.

139
00:19:02,18 --> 00:19:12,13
We're certainly kind of dropping out of society. It's very confronting and. The reason a lot of. You know growth.

140
00:19:12,13 --> 00:19:20,66
And exploration. Goes on up here. I mean amongst the people that are there. It's just sort of.

141
00:19:20,66 --> 00:19:27,39
Second nature to be talking about adding a lot of sin. With the challenges that confront us on that level.

142
00:19:27,39 --> 00:19:32,78
And i don't know how much that goes on in wider society i know.

143
00:19:32,78 --> 00:19:38,1
It's certainly increasing i mean you can pick up all sorts of magazines and things like that

144
00:19:38,1 --> 00:19:44,77
and find out it was that reflect that interest the personal growth movement. And that's a very important component.

145
00:19:44,77 --> 00:19:57,34
For example of marriage guidance. Associations. And certainly it's a really important aspect of lesia.

146
00:19:57,34 --> 00:20:03,95
I think that when people it's not men's loz hierarchy of needs once people's basic needs to meet food food shelter.

147
00:20:06,62 --> 00:20:13,58
Security on a move physical level when we become free to explore other issues you can pierce no growth really

148
00:20:13,58 --> 00:20:26,02
when you're stabbing somali. It's not an issue. But up at we people have more time. And certainly i think. Now.

149
00:20:26,02 --> 00:20:35,07
With so many people unemployed. And sam many people are facing issues such as streets.

150
00:20:35,07 --> 00:20:39,12
There was a story on the radio the other day that have many more mena going along.

151
00:20:39,12 --> 00:20:50,82
To council is about stresses in the laws particularly with the recession. And loss of income and things like that and.

152
00:20:50,82 --> 00:20:58,02
So sydney people are tuning in wood and. Looking at themselves in the way they. Act two. Life situations.

153
00:20:58,02 --> 00:21:04,22
And not simply reacting and acting at. And being out of touch with what they doing.

154
00:21:04,22 --> 00:21:09,94
They actually thinking about the way they react to things and questioning them so so that we can all react differently.

155
00:21:11,43 --> 00:21:14,94
Cannot look at the situation in a more positive lot and you know.

156
00:21:14,94 --> 00:21:21,03
Do i have to feel i have a will out of it what can i do you to tune this into a creative situation that.

157
00:21:21,03 --> 00:21:30,87
That kind of thinking. Does happen a lot up here and. There's a lot of innovative small businesses for example.

158
00:21:30,87 --> 00:21:43,33
In mysteria. And that's being encouraged you know. With government money. Desperate times.

159
00:21:43,33 --> 00:21:47,49
You so i think that the whole precipitous no growth no movement.

160
00:21:47,49 --> 00:22:26,72
Is to the forefront he had been certainly also growing in the wider society. Thank you. And would. The rest.

161
00:22:26,72 --> 00:22:35,49
Well random been it's been. Quite a strong tradition for the last twenty. Natural birth and hind shoes.

162
00:22:35,49 --> 00:22:45,29
And that was initiated by mothers the. He could not get anybody to attain the booths at hand. And.

163
00:22:45,29 --> 00:22:51,04
So a group of women who believed that they should have the rotch. To a natural booth.

164
00:22:51,04 --> 00:22:54,74
No one and not have a need to syria intervention.

165
00:22:54,74 --> 00:22:58,02
Saw that the only way they could do that was to try and sue

166
00:22:58,02 --> 00:23:02,12
and provide themselves with that syria this which they need.

167
00:23:02,12 --> 00:23:12,31
And most of those lame midwives are competent and will train and responsible and have very good statistics.

168
00:23:12,31 --> 00:23:19,06
In the care of mothers. The idle to pick up when there's a problem and transfer they have a hard transfer you right.

169
00:23:19,96 --> 00:23:32,13
Then. Qualified midwives. In other words they tend to transfuse suna. Yes they've just been deemed to be illegal.

170
00:23:32,13 --> 00:23:34,84
You new south wales.

171
00:23:34,84 --> 00:23:36,18
And that's very threatening from birth

172
00:23:36,18 --> 00:23:43,24
and beyond in nimbin because they have lodged an organization which has depended upon.

173
00:23:44,6 --> 00:23:51,88
And i need wives and booth assistants to provide kin and support.

174
00:23:51,88 --> 00:23:59,32
And with that them who think beyond itself might be in jeopardy and.

175
00:23:59,32 --> 00:24:06,39
Easiness trainee one of the few examples of successful community development in health.

176
00:24:06,39 --> 00:24:12,37
As in is that as it as an organized. It is the end i deal in timbs of what the world health.

177
00:24:13,63 --> 00:24:22,64
Which is to promote right around the world. We as what they call primary health care and putting health care.

178
00:24:22,64 --> 00:24:27,48
Into the hands of the community. Who think beyond have been doing that before cheney.

179
00:24:27,48 --> 00:24:34,54
And now that send three age because of the new says. We just ration will be new south wales and.

180
00:24:34,54 --> 00:24:43,79
He basically had for magid this is an issue of safety. And yet that can't be proven. And the opposite. Has been shine.

181
00:24:45,53 --> 00:24:54,89
There have been the odd limeade wives to be done. Way at things and have jeopardized. The issue of lying we free for.

182
00:24:54,89 --> 00:25:02,11
Other. More numerous and more responsible people. But the noose is registration fraud.

183
00:25:02,11 --> 00:25:10,29
I'm not sure if i've got the right name of the association a bit. Anyway the professional associations of nooses.

184
00:25:10,29 --> 00:25:16,22
Have totally i've looked to for example the right of women to choose. The health care practitioners.

185
00:25:16,22 --> 00:25:27,05
He not an official health care practitioners. They have totally of a loop which the wood health organizations.

186
00:25:27,05 --> 00:25:31,12
Philosophy. With three guide to traditional medicine and i mean we free.

187
00:25:32,59 --> 00:25:43,09
If these women who are practicing law i mean we exist today in africa india. They would be lauded for the activities.

188
00:25:43,25 --> 00:25:45,92
They would be assisted with government grants.

189
00:25:47,48 --> 00:25:57,9
They would be assisted with educational programs that he had they simply. Denigrated ostracized. Made illegal.

190
00:25:57,9 --> 00:26:28,47
Threatened with jail and fines. Why. No. Yes. It was. It was. Well as. The i made was.

191
00:26:28,47 --> 00:26:38,38
Along with most would say hi i'm booth midwives qualified ones. Very much holistic practitioner. And that really.

192
00:26:39,71 --> 00:26:50,64
Influences. Dramatically the way they approach it as a life event. The path for impact. For the family involved.

193
00:26:52,67 --> 00:26:59,02
And interestingly enough if you look at any new seeing course and.

194
00:26:59,02 --> 00:27:03,89
In fact the nuisance registration board itself defines new thing as a not as well as a science.

195
00:27:04,37 --> 00:27:10,62
They promote holistic nursing and they promote the actual use of inchy we shouldn. Off ones.

196
00:27:10,62 --> 00:27:19,87
You know knowing that develops over time with. Exposure to people in the healing. And health professions.

197
00:27:21,43 --> 00:27:26,2
But in the hospital with this there isn't room. Very much for this to happen. The people who are actually doing it.

198
00:27:27,63 --> 00:27:31,23
Tend to be those holistic nursing.

199
00:27:31,23 --> 00:27:38,36
Practitioners who operate outside the system such as nuisance who move into natural medicine. Nuisance to be county.

200
00:27:38,36 --> 00:27:49,52
Made wives who become practitioners. And women often mothers who take up. And i mean we free.

201
00:27:49,52 --> 00:28:11,59
Being booth assistants they the ones who are truly providing holistic. It's an interesting arni well.

202
00:28:14,31 --> 00:28:17,91
Way that mead was using she was in for example ina booth.

203
00:28:17,94 --> 00:28:23,5
He most often comes that we get situations of delight we mothers seem to get stuck.

204
00:28:23,87 --> 00:28:31,49
Now i know i fear the dilation and civic spirit. An arrow to move. And we the whole process seems to be boiled down.

205
00:28:31,49 --> 00:28:37,01
Now if you were in hospital what would happen would be they'd put up a drip in putting oxytocin to stimulate the user

206
00:28:37,01 --> 00:28:45,47
it's in. Speed the whole process up with a drug membranes they'd probably be the nine approaches.

207
00:28:45,47 --> 00:28:58,19
So it's kitted a very physical. Prices. But. Holistic midwives. Would look at that situation and wonder.

208
00:28:58,19 --> 00:29:05,23
Was this something blocking the person. The mother involved. And i would white. They would talk.

209
00:29:06,57 --> 00:29:18,52
They would use all kinds of. Comforting mages. Everything from say hot towels for physical pain to touch. Message.

210
00:29:20,56 --> 00:29:25,78
Providing a really safe and loving environment for the mother to get into his stuff

211
00:29:25,78 --> 00:29:36,42
and explore on an emotional level what's going on along with standard observation. Of mother in baby you know.

212
00:29:36,42 --> 00:29:41,54
Feel right all of those sorts of things to make sure that things were going well

213
00:29:41,54 --> 00:29:51,78
and were remaining within normal limits. And you get breakthroughs in those situations for example i was at a booth.

214
00:29:51,78 --> 00:30:00,04
Semi's ago we. The woman involved was running a business. And she was the mainstay of that business.

215
00:30:00,04 --> 00:30:06,92
And who knew a bit about it but she was really deep down considering that.

216
00:30:06,92 --> 00:30:13,61
At the conflict between who having to start hearing volved in the business and just be. In the other and.

217
00:30:13,61 --> 00:30:22,2
With that was going to be eye candy and. So she got to transition and she just bought and.

218
00:30:22,2 --> 00:30:33,18
She was very recent educated and anxious and. Crawling around on the beach through a narrow something this went on.

219
00:30:33,18 --> 00:30:39,65
And when we just laid it being we took two and we cuddled there and we. You know.

220
00:30:39,65 --> 00:30:45,07
Tried to help you get down into it and finally she just boost at with it. We think.

221
00:30:45,07 --> 00:30:52,45
The woods is it ok for me to be the mother. And we all said yes.

222
00:30:52,45 --> 00:30:58,99
So it's a can and with that she just went straight into second stage and both did. Well.

223
00:30:58,99 --> 00:31:07,69
She just lit guy then and she started to be a baby and she sat up. You know sort of meditation position and she stayed.

224
00:31:07,69 --> 00:31:13,44
After you know a few more minutes have just come and relax and she said i feel all full of light.

225
00:31:13,44 --> 00:31:20,93
And then nobody came out. And those sort of situations just don't happen. Very really you know hospital.

226
00:31:21,57 --> 00:31:29,54
And that's why we even choose him days. That's why a lot of meat was going to home.

227
00:31:29,54 --> 00:31:36,89
Because they can be real authentic midwives. They can be creative.

228
00:31:36,89 --> 00:31:52,71
Spiritually and emotionally as well as competent responsible. Practitioners taking care of the physical. Want to be.
