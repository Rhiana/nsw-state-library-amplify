1
00:00:16,3 --> 00:00:19,00
Ok i thought. It's not. So they're not they're not.

2
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:38,25
So we're trying to you know you know this country has to be so good. Well. I came to the seri about fourteen years ago.

3
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:48,76
My name's katrina shields. And i came to this area. Fourteen years ago. Originally to live on a community called buddy.

4
00:00:49,24 --> 00:00:59,42
That had about twenty adults and fifteen children. That time. And i had been living in another community. In victoria.

5
00:00:59,42 --> 00:01:03,99
That i'd joined. To coming back from india. Had lived in the case.

6
00:01:03,99 --> 00:01:09,46
And particularly india or new poll for a couple of these and.

7
00:01:09,46 --> 00:01:20,67
I knew i didn't want to go back to being an occupational therapist and. Working as a professional. In the mind stream.

8
00:01:20,67 --> 00:01:28,35
So i guess i chose to drop. Brought out. But i was very much attracted to what was happening in this area. And.

9
00:01:28,35 --> 00:01:34,44
On hearing about body found i came up here and. Originally to do a month long meditation retreat.

10
00:01:34,74 --> 00:01:44,86
And i stayed and joined body firm and lived there for four and a half years and still part of that community. And.

11
00:01:44,86 --> 00:01:58,22
But have since moved to the village nearby. And come and go on that. What you originally. I was drawn to the ethical.

12
00:01:58,22 --> 00:02:06,93
Structure that. The. I was strongly influenced and interested in buddhist meditation practice and.

13
00:02:06,93 --> 00:02:15,87
Had been involved in that very strongly in india and i knew i wanted to live a rural community life. But the community.

14
00:02:15,88 --> 00:02:22,08
I was on had a very loose. Structure and wasn't really working for me. And when i met.

15
00:02:22,08 --> 00:02:29,46
These people i guess i was really struck by the spirit. You know there was something that they had going as a group.

16
00:02:29,46 --> 00:02:35,02
That particularly the men. The way they were together that. They're really soft and are open and sharing.

17
00:02:35,02 --> 00:02:40,22
That was the initial thing that attracted me. And then they told me about the structure of the community.

18
00:02:40,22 --> 00:02:47,73
And the fact that the thought buddhist precepts were the bice's of the community. And that just instantly.

19
00:02:47,73 --> 00:02:51,41
Struck a chord with me. And i wanted to go and find out.

20
00:02:51,41 --> 00:02:59,19
And as soon as i walked in i just had this really strong feeling this is my place. You know. And it.

21
00:02:59,19 --> 00:03:06,16
And i just fell into place it is. And i was very happy being there no still feel very strongly connected to that group.

22
00:03:06,16 --> 00:03:16,89
And feel like they my key in law i have a large extended family. In melbourne. These people.

23
00:03:17,71 --> 00:03:24,21
The would say was to cover. How i feel. You know we don't always like each other but.

24
00:03:24,67 --> 00:03:33,03
But there's a strong commitment to each other and we know. Tapes about it tether and. Yeah. We just you know us.

25
00:03:33,03 --> 00:03:46,5
So the sticking together was. Yeah it was very much motivation. And surely by nina search. Him.

26
00:03:47,7 --> 00:03:57,69
Initially i was motivated by and. In a sort of spiritual inquiry and. Personal growth. That's what initially drew me.

27
00:03:57,69 --> 00:04:00,45
Of wanting to discover more about myself.

28
00:04:00,45 --> 00:04:07,11
Had to grow as a person had to overcome my own hang ups had to explain myself and.

29
00:04:07,11 --> 00:04:14,17
So i was very attracted to old thoughts of personal growth. Stuff and also learning had a buddha and.

30
00:04:14,17 --> 00:04:17,75
Grow vegetables and. Mud bricks and.

31
00:04:17,75 --> 00:04:23,59
You know live very simply because i've been i've lived in india and saw how they lived there

32
00:04:23,59 --> 00:04:30,78
and it really touched me very deeply that i just couldn't go on consuming and. Having as much as i saw.

33
00:04:30,78 --> 00:04:37,42
Around me i see that we couldn't sustain that. So i was very attracted to living very simply and.

34
00:04:37,42 --> 00:04:45,05
Then it sort of grew from there that i asked or a number of years i felt drawn back into the mind string.

35
00:04:45,05 --> 00:04:52,34
That i wanted to to make bridges. Back into water a society that somehow.

36
00:04:52,34 --> 00:04:57,7
Wasn't i wasn't personally being naresh to nothing about the oscillation. Of the community.

37
00:04:57,7 --> 00:05:04,81
But also i wanted to be stretched. I actually stepped up by sitting as.

38
00:05:04,81 --> 00:05:13,64
Sitting up a small business in lismore health food business. But then i was also also a lark i'm spec.

39
00:05:13,64 --> 00:05:18,27
Doing occupational therapy and health promotion which is what i've done before. So that drew me back.

40
00:05:19,69 --> 00:05:22,23
So i wanted to span the two worlds.

41
00:05:22,23 --> 00:05:28,42
And to say ok we've experimented with where the alternatives would and learnt a lot in the process hack

42
00:05:28,42 --> 00:05:35,3
and we use that to sort of naresh what was happening in the mind stream. You know and bring.

43
00:05:35,3 --> 00:05:40,28
Really good things about the mind stream. Back into the alternative. Society.

44
00:05:40,28 --> 00:05:45,83
Hell it was things about time management and being efficient and getting things done and really making things happen.

45
00:05:46,06 --> 00:05:51,63
Then i wanted to also bring back into old end of society with it that it wasn't all about. You know.

46
00:05:52,24 --> 00:05:58,88
Just lies in rent having a good. Ah. Actually we worked really hard.

47
00:05:58,88 --> 00:06:03,25
It's not true that we sat around on the trees contemplating and ovals i think.

48
00:06:03,25 --> 00:06:08,77
I think i probably worked had in those days. You know a six day now a days.

49
00:06:10,08 --> 00:06:17,26
It was making mud bricks or working in the god. So sometimes we're actually workaholic about. We did that.

50
00:06:17,26 --> 00:06:29,5
We had a good time. Yes quite strict. Yeah. And i was probably amongst the. The stricter.

51
00:06:29,5 --> 00:06:36,56
You know i was really on about being audie logically sound and. You know everybody should work really haddad and.

52
00:06:36,56 --> 00:06:39,81
You couldn't have anything but organic vegetables and.

53
00:06:39,81 --> 00:06:49,24
You know alcohol was very to brew and cigarettes were out right just and. You know our calves were morally unsound.

54
00:06:49,24 --> 00:06:50,45
I was pretty strict

55
00:06:50,45 --> 00:06:57,54
and i guess a lot of us were we were very idealistic you know we really wanted to be sound about what we were doing

56
00:06:57,54 --> 00:07:05,39
and we didn't want to be on the dull. Saw that meant. Living on the smell of an oily rag.

57
00:07:05,39 --> 00:07:10,73
And getting by very little because we didn't have many sources of income.

58
00:07:10,73 --> 00:07:17,64
So yeah i think we're pretty hard line of softened up a lot. You know. I don't think it was bad.

59
00:07:17,64 --> 00:07:28,66
To be like that but i don't know if that was so sustainable. So.

60
00:07:28,66 --> 00:07:36,59
I moved back into the mainstream and now working part time as a counselor in a women's health center.

61
00:07:36,59 --> 00:07:43,52
Focusing particularly on older women. But i also do training and development work with community groups.

62
00:07:43,52 --> 00:07:48,13
Run workshops and trainings and take. Conflict resolution.

63
00:07:48,13 --> 00:08:02,99
Working together and have been at strategies and team building things like that. You know. Yeah yeah.

64
00:08:02,99 --> 00:08:11,19
Well look i grew out of it. I think. I ended up writing a book which was a synthesis all the ideas.

65
00:08:11,19 --> 00:08:15,87
And the experiments we've had and learning from each other and living in community.

66
00:08:16,3 --> 00:08:25,01
In vain both in social change campaigns fighting for the rainforests working on pace issues. And also.

67
00:08:25,01 --> 00:08:34,4
Synthesizing the. Personal growth. The counseling the creativity and.

68
00:08:34,92 --> 00:08:42,14
Learning how to be effective in social change work. And bringing in more hot. Politics approach into what we do.

69
00:08:42,14 --> 00:08:49,04
So this. This turned into a menu. Of all those different aspects. With exercises that.

70
00:08:49,04 --> 00:09:00,09
I and others had used to grow and to work together in groups though.

71
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:10,54
Ok well the term hot politics was originally coined by a woman called. Friend pavey. Who happened to be american and.

72
00:09:10,54 --> 00:09:15,3
Yes it means bringing together that. Which is normally sane is a separate.

73
00:09:15,3 --> 00:09:26,78
But the how they are most vulnerable path to a loving caring. And you know most being. Bringing that together with.

74
00:09:26,78 --> 00:09:35,46
Influencing social change having power. The structures that. Bring about. Movement in society and.

75
00:09:35,46 --> 00:09:46,09
We often see how that is being incredibly separate from that that. A lot of the models of power of social change.

76
00:09:46,65 --> 00:09:53,00
Saying is you know you. Corrupt. Just that he's so. Wielding power and not caring about the consequences.

77
00:09:53,00 --> 00:10:01,77
That any means justify the means and all of us feel pretty disgusted by that and. Very unattractive.

78
00:10:01,77 --> 00:10:04,27
To that way of bringing about change.

79
00:10:04,27 --> 00:10:09,84
So we've been experimenting with a whole lot of different bias to bring the two together what.

80
00:10:09,84 --> 00:10:15,87
What does the personal growth. And spiritual movement have to do with nourishing political and.

81
00:10:16,56 --> 00:10:23,75
And sustaining political action. And drawing people in who feel powerless and and involved.

82
00:10:24,2 --> 00:10:32,17
We originally got attracted to this. During the early eighty's when.

83
00:10:32,17 --> 00:10:40,69
Many of us felt incredible despair about the nuclear issue that we had a piece of information about what was.

84
00:10:40,69 --> 00:10:49,06
Lockley to happen what could happen what was happening and. It was pretty had to respond. The threat was so huge and.

85
00:10:49,06 --> 00:10:53,86
You know i felt sickened. An overwhelmed and depressed and.

86
00:10:53,86 --> 00:11:00,28
We came across some methods for transforming those feelings. Into effective action.

87
00:11:00,28 --> 00:11:04,64
And that was to actually grief to validate it to spay

88
00:11:04,64 --> 00:11:11,59
and to recognize that our responses were really a sign reaction to an in science situation.

89
00:11:11,59 --> 00:11:18,82
And that perhaps no other generation of the sysop. Squarely. To the fact of its own extinction. That.

90
00:11:18,82 --> 00:11:23,6
Many of us grew up feeling like. They just wasn't a future where there is an alternative future.

91
00:11:23,6 --> 00:11:31,1
Or whether it was the one mapped out to it by the mainstream. So that's a pretty had thing. To give up.

92
00:11:31,1 --> 00:11:36,91
The feeling like what's the use of having children. You know if we do have children what are we bringing them into.

93
00:11:36,91 --> 00:11:46,5
So we're facing. Pretty strong despair. And so we experimented with methods. Working with grief. Ritual work.

94
00:11:47,9 --> 00:11:48,93
Support groups.

95
00:11:48,93 --> 00:11:53,78
To bring that out and what we found was that by going quite deeply into that despair that

96
00:11:53,78 --> 00:12:02,61
and hopelessness that we felt that actually liberated. A lot of energy and hope that was the amazing thing that.

97
00:12:02,61 --> 00:12:10,15
The more we had knowledge to fully. The mohel passion for life. Came through. And then actually.

98
00:12:10,15 --> 00:12:15,87
We were connecting deeper sources of energy. And realizing that that. Pain came from.

99
00:12:17,65 --> 00:12:23,93
I have a feeling an unknowing a very into connectedness. We hurt. Because we cade. We hurt.

100
00:12:23,93 --> 00:12:29,54
Because we were part of life and life was threatened. We weren't personally necessarily threatened.

101
00:12:29,54 --> 00:12:34,32
But we could see what was happening to other species and. What might happen.

102
00:12:34,8 --> 00:12:42,97
And so it was by validating then interconnection that. The more power. And sense of being able to effect change grew.

103
00:12:42,97 --> 00:12:45,36
But then we also needed to learn skills. You know.

104
00:12:45,36 --> 00:12:51,02
How do you organize how do you run groups how do you conduct meetings how do you get release that really get people

105
00:12:51,02 --> 00:12:56,09
along. Heck and we have fun doing this. We're going to be doing it the rest of our life you know.

106
00:12:56,09 --> 00:13:04,28
So we really want to enjoy it. And so a lot of. What we've learnt in. Living in community. And working on social.

107
00:13:04,28 --> 00:13:17,38
Campaigns you know brought back together with this emotional and spiritual work. You know. Well yeah yeah. That. Ok.

108
00:13:17,38 --> 00:13:24,05
So we're trying to make something positive out of something that was very negative. Like a threat to the future.

109
00:13:24,05 --> 00:13:28,19
The possible loss. Completely of a future. Or at least.

110
00:13:28,19 --> 00:13:34,49
All this beauty and this environment that we could see around us. The extinction of species.

111
00:13:34,49 --> 00:13:42,78
Pollution of the air and water. Had to turn that into a source. But also celebration.

112
00:13:43,45 --> 00:13:51,2
And drawing on inner resources in a selves and in it and see that.

113
00:13:51,2 --> 00:14:01,45
Yes as a cause for celebration that you have this much to do. And that can be done joyfully and. Hopefully effectively.

114
00:14:01,45 --> 00:14:06,58
Because it's not just about having a good time we also want to make effective change. And that's.

115
00:14:06,58 --> 00:14:12,79
That's an ongoing challenge to me but a lot of these people that are very.

116
00:14:12,79 --> 00:14:15,87
Left brain and like we've got no time for fun and. You know.

117
00:14:15,94 --> 00:14:18,89
We've got no time to sit down and work on our relationships.

118
00:14:18,89 --> 00:14:24,68
Because the campaign you know there's this campaign and there's this mating and. Hell is this deadline. Like.

119
00:14:24,68 --> 00:14:31,05
That's that's no more effective. You know so really facing up to the fact that if you burn people out.

120
00:14:31,05 --> 00:14:39,06
And you have such a lousy time. It doesn't work. You know if it's. You know building a social change movement.

121
00:14:39,06 --> 00:14:41,14
So the same that. Building movements.

122
00:14:41,14 --> 00:14:46,96
The change really needed something much more integrated that we knew had lived together

123
00:14:46,96 --> 00:14:55,45
when you had a result of conflicts. When you had to support each other we knew had. Effectively matings.

124
00:14:55,45 --> 00:15:02,88
You know stick to agendas plan. Campaigns and. A lot of the lessons of community came at that.

125
00:15:02,88 --> 00:15:08,7
That if you can live together in bringing a few children together and solve your conflicts. You've got great resources.

126
00:15:08,7 --> 00:15:14,82
Then going out and changing what's happening in newtown or changing what's happening. Why did the newtown.

127
00:15:26,46 --> 00:15:28,59
Well perhaps.

128
00:15:28,59 --> 00:15:34,88
The how politics visit with it was similar i to actually see it as an integration off of mescaline

129
00:15:34,88 --> 00:15:42,06
and the feminine principles. If you lock. If you say traditionally the feminine principle is being about. You know.

130
00:15:42,06 --> 00:15:47,76
Caring and had to nurturing and nurturing and the masculine principle about being.

131
00:15:47,76 --> 00:15:55,58
You know organized in effect to the up front and. Leadership. And exercising power.

132
00:15:56,37 --> 00:16:02,11
I see the hap politics as bringing those two together. They're both necessary. All hat.

133
00:16:03,55 --> 00:16:13,05
You know much feel good but it's not going to bring about change necessarily and ole old head isn't going to last

134
00:16:13,05 --> 00:16:15,87
and people won't want to be part of it. So.

135
00:16:15,94 --> 00:16:23,85
I see how politics is bringing the hate in the you know the spirit in the body. The mescaline and timonen. Together.

136
00:16:23,85 --> 00:16:30,7
And to now. And hopefully have the best of both. Yeah.

137
00:16:30,7 --> 00:16:44,94
That's what you want to give them they're what makes it extremely wise.

138
00:16:45,16 --> 00:16:48,63
So what some of the extremes we went to in the early days.

139
00:16:48,63 --> 00:16:52,83
Well there was extreme hardline and i know i was one of those.

140
00:16:52,83 --> 00:17:03,49
Really trying to stick very rigidly to audiology and to anything from the mind strain that might be you know.

141
00:17:03,49 --> 00:17:12,74
I have alternatives. But i guess we're pretty extreme about. You know with things like..

142
00:17:10,43 --> 00:17:20,7
Experimenting with bio energy to their p. You know. Because we're laces and. And you know nudity and.

143
00:17:20,7 --> 00:17:30,03
Things like rats and. You know i look back and chuckle. Now at some of those things some of the. The the no i even.

144
00:17:30,03 --> 00:17:38,12
Perhaps that we approach. Things. And i was thinking about. You know i saw a set up a small business and.

145
00:17:38,12 --> 00:17:42,84
Selling health foods. And i was incredibly naive about business.

146
00:17:42,84 --> 00:17:47,95
I went in thinking i was just doing it because it was doing good it never occurred to me that would make money

147
00:17:47,95 --> 00:17:52,97
or that it should make money. You know i just didn't think like that. It was just. What's good for the group.

148
00:17:54,5 --> 00:17:59,13
Now i think i'd stop and say well. Is this going to make it because that matters.

149
00:17:59,13 --> 00:18:10,35
So i don't know what other extremes pepsi extremes of sort of polity. That were subjected us. To mean.

150
00:18:10,35 --> 00:18:19,67
I lived for quite a long time in a taint. In the rainforest. And then. You waited on to shades. Without walls.

151
00:18:19,67 --> 00:18:25,18
Amongst the leeches and the ticks and the snakes and the frogs and. I mean that had its real beauty.

152
00:18:25,18 --> 00:18:32,29
But it wasn't that practical and you clouds went moldy and. You know you got sick and.

153
00:18:32,29 --> 00:18:37,63
Got pretty called and damp and wear it and. I don't think you could keep that up and.

154
00:18:37,63 --> 00:18:41,44
You know washing your claws in the crate with cold water and. You know.

155
00:18:42,11 --> 00:18:54,13
Didn't have any electricity because that was very bush. So yeah. It was really good to experience that.

156
00:18:54,13 --> 00:18:58,94
But it wasn't sustainable. You know. I guess i got sick of that and.

157
00:18:58,94 --> 00:19:06,75
I discovered when i wanted to move back into the mainstream and. Hold down a job. Even if it was a pat down job. Well.

158
00:19:06,75 --> 00:19:15,68
I had to turn up looking kind of reasonable. But i wasn't any good if my clothes were covered in mold and. You know.

159
00:19:15,68 --> 00:19:19,77
Hadn't been washed and. Even though i might have really good reasons for that.

160
00:19:19,77 --> 00:19:33,53
It just wasn't going to go out and very well. Yeah. It wasn't deliberate. Yeah. It wasn't deliberate to say you know.

161
00:19:33,53 --> 00:19:40,43
Ok poll we are or whatever. But. But yeah. Aspas who were trying to stretch the limits of house.

162
00:19:40,43 --> 00:19:47,13
And how self-sufficient also. Really strongly about being self-sufficient. That it mattered. That a groom on food.

163
00:19:47,13 --> 00:19:53,00
And if that meant that i was only living on. You know. The vegetables that are they got and then that's what i do.

164
00:19:53,00 --> 00:19:59,95
And i used to feel offended if people went and bought imported. Tofu. Something like that. You know if it offended.

165
00:19:59,95 --> 00:20:06,9
Some really strongly held principle and. You know you could make your own clothes and could recycle and.

166
00:20:06,9 --> 00:20:14,65
You know you could cut down use of the cab and. We didn't need electricity and water was a bit of a luxury and.

167
00:20:14,65 --> 00:20:26,92
Yeah i think i took it a bit. Ronit. Well the book's cold in the target man.

168
00:20:27,48 --> 00:20:33,4
And that grew out of the four time we were joined on the community by.

169
00:20:33,4 --> 00:20:41,71
I put this monk who was a political refugee from thailand. His loss was threatened by his political activities and.

170
00:20:41,71 --> 00:20:51,11
So he lived on the farm and wrote poetry and paintings and. Contemplated and. He gave the painting to each person.

171
00:20:51,11 --> 00:20:57,03
On the community and i came home one day and on the floor of my hat. He'd done this painting.

172
00:20:57,03 --> 00:21:04,52
In very simple brush strokes all. A rampant. Tyga. And the caption was the best place for meditation.

173
00:21:04,52 --> 00:21:06,87
Is in the target man and.

174
00:21:06,87 --> 00:21:14,54
I couldn't make a lot of sense of it at the time but i realized later that then i was very much into withdrawal.

175
00:21:14,54 --> 00:21:25,38
That i wanted to practice meditation and. Be away from the hurly burly. To be quiet and to be with my. My clan.

176
00:21:25,38 --> 00:21:32,49
With my chosen family and perhaps not have to mix it with that. Rather yucky world at the and.

177
00:21:32,49 --> 00:21:36,28
Lighter and when we came involved in campaigns to size the rainforest

178
00:21:36,28 --> 00:21:44,75
and other social issues are realize what he was getting at he was saying hey maybe. Meditation really has.

179
00:21:44,75 --> 00:21:51,31
Through ition. When you can keep an open mind and open hat in the spirit of inquiry. When you're in the thick of it.

180
00:21:51,31 --> 00:22:03,62
You know. And get back out there. So that's been my challenge and. I think that he was. What i was trying to tell me.

181
00:22:03,62 --> 00:22:10,8
Yeah yeah. You know. And surely. I think.

182
00:22:10,8 --> 00:22:17,93
My focus was on my personal growth the now groups personal growth and creating alternative. And now.

183
00:22:17,93 --> 00:22:26,43
I see the movement back into the mainstream. To take. What we've learned. And experimented with. Back in and take.

184
00:22:26,43 --> 00:22:31,08
What's good about it. And then straight back into the alternative that they're not so separate now.

185
00:22:31,08 --> 00:22:36,98
I mean things we were talking about that were considered extremely radical i mean organic a culture.

186
00:22:37,96 --> 00:22:43,83
Or even you know sharing in community or. Things like that. And now just.

187
00:22:43,83 --> 00:22:56,79
Very run of the mill it everybody can talk about it. Which is great. Oh hades. Well the world's.

188
00:22:56,79 --> 00:23:04,22
Still in a pretty bad state and. There's just. I mean it's a worse state than it was fourteen years ago.

189
00:23:04,22 --> 00:23:10,46
Maybe the uniquely clad has lifted. Some water. Although we have still have an enormous threat from nuclear waste.

190
00:23:11,91 --> 00:23:20,95
That it hasn't gone away. So there's lots of challenges. About how we're really going to affect change.

191
00:23:20,95 --> 00:23:28,5
And what to do that we're going to have to work together in wise. Which were than he had glimpses of and.

192
00:23:28,5 --> 00:23:34,06
I think one of the pres the. Legacies of the post aquarius. Was.

193
00:23:34,06 --> 00:23:36,57
You know how can we can't come together and live

194
00:23:36,57 --> 00:23:43,59
and learn from each other in a in a very open way that that lesson still needs to go on.

195
00:23:43,59 --> 00:23:52,98
You know we need to not have have can we actually sustain life on earth. And cooperate and understand each other it's.

196
00:23:52,98 --> 00:24:11,49
I mean it's happening all over the world it's not just the seri are of course. But we need it more than. You ran.

197
00:24:11,49 --> 00:24:21,88
Initially most spiritual. Was focused very much on. Meditation practice. I saw that as being the main vehicle for.

198
00:24:21,88 --> 00:24:28,61
Growth and change. And most. Most sitting practice. To get in contact with.

199
00:24:28,61 --> 00:24:40,44
Deep energies within myself and to understand. My mind and. It's hard to talk. And living as a strong ethical.

200
00:24:40,44 --> 00:24:46,29
Structure of the buddha's precepts. Was important. Now. Us.

201
00:24:46,29 --> 00:24:53,93
Say that is still important i don't meditate as much as i used to us do. Like to have a retreat.

202
00:24:53,93 --> 00:24:58,5
Once see what we can be in silence and get back in contact with myself.

203
00:24:58,5 --> 00:25:06,64
But i try and bring my spiritual practice into everything i do. You know whether it's doing the counseling work.

204
00:25:06,64 --> 00:25:14,65
I do with women oh. Working on a campaign to clean up. You know the local area or.

205
00:25:14,65 --> 00:25:21,03
Working on a committee in the local government. To introduce small community consultation. I say that. As the arraign s.

206
00:25:21,03 --> 00:25:26,28
A spiritual practice hack and i listen to this person that i have incredibly different views.

207
00:25:26,28 --> 00:25:33,2
With and still stay open hatted and. How can i find a way to cooperate.

208
00:25:33,2 --> 00:25:39,98
You know how can i work on my own stuff so that we're not so much in conflict.

209
00:25:39,98 --> 00:25:48,18
Heck going on one time will balance and hack and i keep trusting. You know just trusting that. That is good.

210
00:25:48,18 --> 00:25:54,92
In other people that there's good around me. And that i can draw an energy. That's much bigger and wider than me.

211
00:25:54,92 --> 00:25:59,59
I mean this times. When i'm running workshops and maybe.

212
00:25:59,59 --> 00:26:05,88
I'm facilitating a conflict it happened last week a large group. Thirty three people. Lots of conflict.

213
00:26:05,88 --> 00:26:08,22
And they've brought me into try and you know.

214
00:26:08,22 --> 00:26:12,45
Fix it up and i'm still standing there thinking hell i can't do this you know.

215
00:26:12,45 --> 00:26:15,87
This is too had i'd rather be anywhere that he had this just feel terrible.

216
00:26:16,49 --> 00:26:22,45
But maybe it's just that moment of thinking well. I'm not just me. You know maybe i can i've been myself.

217
00:26:22,45 --> 00:26:30,69
Too wide energies. You know i cannot be a channel here. For having these people appreciate each other you know.

218
00:26:30,69 --> 00:26:37,3
To get back to buy six and. Find some some caring and. Willing to listen. And.

219
00:26:37,3 --> 00:26:48,29
So maybe it's just a moment of reflection and grounding and praying. Really and and when i do that.

220
00:26:48,29 --> 00:26:49,97
Amazing things happen. You know.

221
00:26:49,97 --> 00:26:59,08
And i know that's not just coming from me so i guess that's how some of the ways in which i experience.

222
00:26:59,08 --> 00:27:15,02
Spiritual practice now. Yeah. Are remind optimistic by saying results. Yeah. I actually say that this stuff works.

223
00:27:15,02 --> 00:27:18,95
That people can cooperate. That.

224
00:27:18,95 --> 00:27:24,17
I have experience growth in myself i've experienced enormous growth in the people around me.

225
00:27:24,17 --> 00:27:30,84
I've seen groups turn around from a point of conflict and hug closeness to. Optimism and cooperation.

226
00:27:31,27 --> 00:27:40,36
I've seen campaigns that work. I've seen have said the change in consciousness about rainforests. You know.

227
00:27:40,36 --> 00:27:50,51
In in ten years. It's really turned around. Saw all remain optimistic. By saying the results and.

228
00:27:50,51 --> 00:28:05,26
By having a good time. As ago. That i enjoy what i do. And that. That feeds me and. I work with a lot of loving people.

229
00:28:05,26 --> 00:28:17,23
And that saves me yeah. Yeah i think i am. I think this is the korean ideals i see. Very relevant.

230
00:28:17,7 --> 00:28:26,63
I mean they not know about long hair isn't beads and. You know when pregnant. I mean that externals.

231
00:28:26,63 --> 00:28:37,28
But i say the values of cooperation of living closely to the earth. To being open to night. Voluntary simplicity.

232
00:28:37,28 --> 00:28:41,11
Experimentation. Personal growth. I see them as incredibly relevant.

233
00:28:41,11 --> 00:28:51,77
More relevant now than they were then you know that. Perhaps there was no evil idealism and.

234
00:28:51,77 --> 00:29:10,5
Perhaps it would force the wood. It's self absorption. But that we're good ideals and see the ninety's as being.

235
00:29:10,5 --> 00:29:13,94
You know the place where they hated more than ever. You know they.

236
00:29:13,94 --> 00:29:17,98
The excesses of the eighty's and the greed of the eighty's.

237
00:29:17,98 --> 00:29:27,27
Has really taught us that we need it more than ever

238
00:29:27,27 --> 00:29:35,52
when i say women's issue is being a strong thread that's been running through the growth will change.

239
00:29:35,95 --> 00:29:42,96
I mean for me as a woman but also in the movements. Our member we've made a video of. The struggle for to rainy.

240
00:29:42,96 --> 00:29:52,65
Creek rainforest a bat. Thirteen years ago. And in playing it again. I remember people saying.

241
00:29:52,65 --> 00:29:58,22
Yeah but where are the women. You know. The guys who are getting up and talking. That we're really taking the lead.

242
00:29:58,22 --> 00:30:06,36
We were certainly there. We were doing a lot of work. But we weren't speaking up and. We didn't see that as our place.

243
00:30:06,36 --> 00:30:08,95
You know. So in fact.

244
00:30:08,95 --> 00:30:13,81
There was a hell of a lot of sure going isn't really running through a lot of the alternative communities.

245
00:30:13,81 --> 00:30:18,19
The women were barefoot and pregnant washing the. Well the guys were happy wearing and.

246
00:30:18,19 --> 00:30:25,00
In fact six were also very strong. And i. They were very strong in a lot of social change groups.

247
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:33,07
So it's been really important for women to get together and to in paris so. And to draw on the water women's movement.

248
00:30:33,07 --> 00:30:42,5
To nourish action within the alternative community and. You know peace groups and in community action groups.

249
00:30:42,5 --> 00:30:49,2
To say hey we've got we've got an equivalent. We've got skills. We need to be empowered.

250
00:30:49,36 --> 00:30:54,09
We need to empower each other and. Work together is a cools.

251
00:30:54,09 --> 00:31:00,56
And so that's been that's been an important lesson i think that came quite light. To the alternative movement.

252
00:31:00,81 --> 00:31:07,14
Well things that were acceptable still on communities around here. Wouldn't have been acceptable in that.

253
00:31:07,14 --> 00:31:20,71
In many of the city groups. There was also a difference as well. Yes yes i think the. The shia. Physical reality.

254
00:31:20,71 --> 00:31:28,28
That many of us were living in. Unfortunately. Initially halasz at some of the six rolls. Is a baby on the way.

255
00:31:28,28 --> 00:31:35,03
And this has to be built. You know is this a time for the woman. You know stab at square one learning how to build.

256
00:31:36,12 --> 00:31:39,21
Oh she's got a baby on the hip. I mean who. You know.

257
00:31:39,21 --> 00:31:43,67
Is it going to be quicker for her to wash the nappies and feed the baby and him to get on with building.

258
00:31:43,67 --> 00:31:53,15
And unfortunately. You know. Efficiency. Route. Often and. And it. And it got more and more ingrained in that way.

259
00:31:53,15 --> 00:31:55,29
But many of us said why.
