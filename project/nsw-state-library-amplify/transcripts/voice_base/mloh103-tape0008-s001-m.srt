1
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:38,08
We've been doing a maid leave so. David had left. I i was at university and not in seventy three.

2
00:00:38,08 --> 00:00:44,26
And it was the first term holidays when back when we had three terms rather than four semesters and the friends.

3
00:00:44,26 --> 00:00:47,54
In down my name in the house i was sharing said.

4
00:00:47,54 --> 00:00:52,06
We're all going on the trying to nimbin to not to which i sit and wait.

5
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:59,09
And it was part of the eye us which was destroyed in the student spliced in the university students.

6
00:00:59,09 --> 00:01:04,41
Had arranged to try and call the good times express which went from sydney. Sorry from melbourne.

7
00:01:04,41 --> 00:01:10,67
I think the bus students over from adelaide. And the train went from no been through sydney. And took about.

8
00:01:10,67 --> 00:01:17,66
Seemingly five weeks. To get from sydney to to lose more than was stuck on busses and track down to nimbin.

9
00:01:17,66 --> 00:01:22,85
And it was about eight thousand people here i'd never heard of newman i had never even actually been out of sydney much.

10
00:01:22,85 --> 00:01:30,44
Up to that point and. That was my first real connection there and it's very hard to use lighted to explain the.

11
00:01:30,44 --> 00:01:34,99
Well to illustrate the impact of that festival and.

12
00:01:34,99 --> 00:01:41,77
The crush of the people and just the openness and spiritually just how wonderful it was through all of us boys

13
00:01:41,77 --> 00:01:48,7
and girls who came from the suburbs and the unis. And then of course i went back to uni after that. As we all did.

14
00:01:48,7 --> 00:01:53,24
And i came up at the end of that year. For a couple of weeks holiday.

15
00:01:53,24 --> 00:01:57,7
Staying i've read you car which is just over the hill in the tweed valley.

16
00:01:57,7 --> 00:02:07,3
And but those couple of weeks seems to have turned. Nearly twenty years now. So.

17
00:02:08,66 --> 00:02:14,51
Well it largely was because it was based around the campsites of the people who you know. Formed in groups all of the.

18
00:02:14,64 --> 00:02:22,65
The geography here. This festival was.

19
00:02:22,65 --> 00:02:28,00
It was really interesting because it was sort of like de centralization in that they were camping areas.

20
00:02:28,00 --> 00:02:37,61
All over the geography here in basically. People from their own mini hamlets. Within that within all of that and.

21
00:02:37,61 --> 00:02:42,55
It was unseasonably. Fine and dry and beautiful all through the my.

22
00:02:42,55 --> 00:02:43,69
Every day was hot and fine

23
00:02:43,69 --> 00:02:50,9
and all the knots were were do we clear except for the full moon on which was actually a bit cloudy so for a change the

24
00:02:50,9 --> 00:02:53,73
drop to the ground was dry.

25
00:02:53,73 --> 00:02:59,68
But the town was a great big focus for all of the things that were going on throughout the time.

26
00:02:59,68 --> 00:03:03,3
And i think just the fact of the people sharing in a zone.

27
00:03:03,3 --> 00:03:11,08
And everyone's company on this large scale in a in a sort of a disorganized why we're also used to coming from.

28
00:03:11,08 --> 00:03:16,08
Organized events and sporting events and sites live in certain cities but this was very very different.

29
00:03:16,08 --> 00:03:19,01
And it was very much mike your own festival.

30
00:03:19,01 --> 00:03:23,69
And for all of us had been to pop festivals and sundries and well life isn't things it wasn't.

31
00:03:23,69 --> 00:03:30,41
It wasn't a rock star festival. They had the african. South african paying us dollar brand.

32
00:03:30,41 --> 00:03:38,95
But it was very much an on ego situation in that even he was sitting on a little six inch high stage down in the

33
00:03:38,95 --> 00:03:45,17
theater with a with an all piano want. And the bowls of bengal were there but they weren't. You know.

34
00:03:45,17 --> 00:03:46,33
They weren't i see d.c.

35
00:03:46,33 --> 00:03:53,64
or Ten years after woodstock when you think what was very prominent there i think especially with the religious groups.

36
00:03:53,64 --> 00:04:02,88
All manner of seventy's. Surely this and bobber that who were actually a good deal more organized than.

37
00:04:02,88 --> 00:04:08,52
Many of us who were came over they were sort of open. Open eyes and open hearts and open monster things.

38
00:04:08,52 --> 00:04:16,83
And they were sort of the day within themselves had sort of a theatrical exposition. Musical expedition the singing.

39
00:04:16,83 --> 00:04:18,18
And a performance thing that.

40
00:04:18,18 --> 00:04:23,97
I think strongly touched trayvon as these sort of small professions would coming into town.

41
00:04:23,97 --> 00:04:27,59
After dark and go into the hole and set up with candles and music

42
00:04:27,59 --> 00:04:35,69
and sing this song of which you have a particular generally asen leaning that these religious groups had.

43
00:04:35,69 --> 00:04:43,31
And the theater and the acrobatics of course who came in town and performed every not.

44
00:04:43,31 --> 00:04:48,89
But to be very hard to say the name in festival was this or that all of these events happened

45
00:04:48,89 --> 00:04:52,68
or these people did specific things because it wasn't like that at all.

46
00:04:52,68 --> 00:05:04,12
It was very much this idea of do it yourself first of all it was like an hour of a cross between..

47
00:05:00,67 --> 00:05:20,76
Between a boy scout camp and being on l.s.d. It's really you. Both of them strangely. This is something that struck us.

48
00:05:20,76 --> 00:05:31,17
That i think in nimbin. And i think everyone. Because it has to be admitted the during that time a lot of the.

49
00:05:31,17 --> 00:05:36,95
Solace or the mushrooms were taken. And so the whole. Impact. In.

50
00:05:36,95 --> 00:05:40,09
You know not just visually and all related the team in six

51
00:05:40,09 --> 00:05:45,33
and seven that night since is if you want to count that many was very very strong on people.

52
00:05:45,33 --> 00:05:49,68
But i think the fact was and i've always felt that. And you got to say that mean than.

53
00:05:50,82 --> 00:05:58,37
Even though i didn't know the truth of a den member in is in was the graveyard of one of the greatest forests.

54
00:05:58,37 --> 00:06:03,04
Of red cedar that was ever known and it was called the red sea.

55
00:06:03,04 --> 00:06:06,38
And even when we came here and a lot of these things are gone now.

56
00:06:06,38 --> 00:06:11,59
But all of the hills and many of the messiah have gone. Had these the ring by a tree.

57
00:06:11,59 --> 00:06:16,73
So the reminds quite tall you know fifty one hundred feet high. With you know the remains of what.

58
00:06:17,44 --> 00:06:24,43
What limits they had up the top and of course they've been going on mushrooms. You had this. I did have this graveyard.

59
00:06:24,43 --> 00:06:32,62
Feeling. And you could see a lot of erosion. In the hills around a lot of the slips and slides for him. So even though.

60
00:06:32,62 --> 00:06:37,27
You got the ream of the trees in the forested hills around i mean.

61
00:06:37,27 --> 00:06:44,23
It was obvious that this place had been had been cleared out. Lock stock and barrel. Of all this data.

62
00:06:44,23 --> 00:06:51,45
And it was like it had been repapered with and. Darian and. Bananas and logs and things.

63
00:06:51,45 --> 00:06:57,75
But there was a very much something missing from here and i've always felt that that. We're sort of here.

64
00:06:57,75 --> 00:07:02,64
After the event so to speak. But then again in the twenty years that i've been here.

65
00:07:02,64 --> 00:07:05,7
Many of these old bring back trees it was so apparent then.

66
00:07:05,7 --> 00:07:12,14
Gone now been cleared or knocked out because the dam dangerous anyone. And of course in that time actually.

67
00:07:12,14 --> 00:07:13,84
Because you go back to the time when they were briefed here

68
00:07:13,84 --> 00:07:16,89
and you can actually be fined for having trees on properties

69
00:07:16,89 --> 00:07:20,59
when big has the run of the die you know too many trees you'd be fined

70
00:07:20,59 --> 00:07:27,45
and you wouldn't do well within the industry because it was clear everything as many blades of grass for the cales to

71
00:07:27,45 --> 00:07:31,87
where it was what it was all about but that's changed a lot of a lot of the base has gone by the wind now.

72
00:07:31,87 --> 00:07:37,27
And there are many more trees have grown back up in a lot of the people who've come in the intervening years of course

73
00:07:37,27 --> 00:07:45,91
the plant a lot more. And so i think that's. It's made the place thing a lot a lot nicer. Now than it felt then.

74
00:07:45,91 --> 00:07:50,84
Because there was this strange sort of ripened. Impression of i got from back then.

75
00:07:50,84 --> 00:07:55,76
Much as i love being here and a lot more love to be out in the hills or not being a big boy scout in the carrier

76
00:07:55,76 --> 00:08:01,76
and all those things and i've camped a lot i'm going to leave the bush. But i hadn't been to this area before.

77
00:08:01,76 --> 00:08:06,22
And it you know it has that stripped. Eroded. Thing that.

78
00:08:06,22 --> 00:08:10,75
It's sort of was in a real state of transition then because all the previous industries.

79
00:08:10,75 --> 00:08:22,65
And the reason for their being had sort of folded. Because it's deliberate that you. Used.

80
00:08:22,65 --> 00:08:30,76
Well i sort of kind for hold the die. Back at the end of that. I came to niman for holiday. The end of that.

81
00:08:30,76 --> 00:08:33,71
University year in which the aquarius festival is on.

82
00:08:33,71 --> 00:08:40,72
And i just as the group i was with who were a group of artists and musicians and sculptors.

83
00:08:40,72 --> 00:08:47,95
We just suddenly realized that we were this. To house all this many community. With byelaws and berries and.

84
00:08:47,95 --> 00:08:54,98
Igloos and. Tepees and. We just became this artistic. It wasn't a conscious decision really.

85
00:08:54,98 --> 00:08:59,55
People were there for various reasons a couple had the house all others were visitors and people coming in

86
00:08:59,55 --> 00:09:05,77
but we actually spend most of the year together on that point. And did a large exhibition in the sydney gallery.

87
00:09:05,77 --> 00:09:08,92
And hogarth gallery through that here.

88
00:09:08,92 --> 00:09:11,73
And started doing a lot of performances and and music

89
00:09:11,73 --> 00:09:17,8
and i was a lost all i hadn't got into having been a good catholic boy in sydney and gone through university.

90
00:09:19,92 --> 00:09:22,37
This was just a whole new opening up for me.

91
00:09:22,37 --> 00:09:27,27
I started playing the piano when i was seven years old but most of that was in a formal academic sense

92
00:09:27,27 --> 00:09:31,91
and i hadn't really got two or three or more expressive forms of music to.

93
00:09:31,91 --> 00:09:36,17
Really that the evening that i came out here at the end of non in seventy three

94
00:09:36,17 --> 00:09:51,22
and i haven't really looked back from that point up in musician and performer largely since then i thought. Oh here.

95
00:09:52,51 --> 00:09:55,34
I've been writing poetry now for about eighteen years.

96
00:09:56,45 --> 00:10:01,01
I think it was in the mid seventies i went down to adelaide for the arts festival

97
00:10:01,01 --> 00:10:07,31
and i just was mixing with an old friend richard tipping the adelaide bicester powered.

98
00:10:07,31 --> 00:10:10,7
And i just got involved with all the writers down there and.

99
00:10:10,7 --> 00:10:16,47
I started writing immediately when i left there not through a lot of that time also. I was working in a way and.

100
00:10:16,47 --> 00:10:21,43
That's quite a few of the people from nimbin it was a long period where for about five six years.

101
00:10:21,43 --> 00:10:27,11
The number knots would go off and work the way to harvest that in the northwest of the state. Strangely.

102
00:10:27,11 --> 00:10:33,08
At that time because we were not from the area. Which is why we originally got work out there.

103
00:10:33,08 --> 00:10:38,73
Because there was lots of problems of. Potentials for corruption. With people going to. Grading.

104
00:10:38,73 --> 00:10:44,55
Like a farmer's harley because you live there and it was very hard not to do with our mights the almight your problem.

105
00:10:44,55 --> 00:10:49,09
And also which i found to be a good benefit of the toms a lot of the newman people didn't drink.

106
00:10:49,09 --> 00:10:53,66
And once we stuck it on these are our lines out in a bleeding heart middle of nowhere.

107
00:10:53,66 --> 00:11:00,00
Many of the our tuna workers that had in the past. Took to the drink pretty readily readily and radically and.

108
00:11:00,00 --> 00:11:04,78
There was a problem the whole ship load of weight was turned back from china because it hadn't been properly tested in.

109
00:11:05,8 --> 00:11:11,95
And so the number not so you know fifty or sixty of them would go there each year to work. But also was working.

110
00:11:11,95 --> 00:11:14,05
Cotton harvest and and.

111
00:11:14,05 --> 00:11:19,24
Fruit picking down on the mary and i just got into this of an acura of writing about travels and.

112
00:11:19,24 --> 00:11:22,69
Working in may and then working harvests.

113
00:11:22,69 --> 00:11:26,8
And then getting back home and starting to write more and more about nimble and the changes in the people

114
00:11:26,8 --> 00:11:33,21
and just the color of the lack of color of things happening here as well. And.

115
00:11:33,21 --> 00:11:38,11
In the late seventy's and early eighty's through the folk concerts and the variety concerts

116
00:11:38,11 --> 00:11:44,77
and my classical music concerts and. Just the cafes a rainbow cafe and.

117
00:11:44,77 --> 00:11:49,61
Other sort of event small and large interest of events and annual shows.

118
00:11:49,83 --> 00:11:54,37
I just started performing more and more the power tree that i was doing and also getting in league with two

119
00:11:54,37 --> 00:12:02,77
or three other writers up here. Who were or weren't writing about things local and. It just grew from that point.

120
00:12:02,77 --> 00:12:07,2
To the extent now that we have regular we have shows called the grand piano

121
00:12:07,2 --> 00:12:14,51
and poetry concerts where we'll have six power and six. Paying interests. But also run. Poetry events and all these.

122
00:12:14,71 --> 00:12:22,31
More in bar and buy. And have a touring group as well. But a lot of that comes from. Just my own background i mean i'm.

123
00:12:22,31 --> 00:12:29,65
I did. I did history at school i did. Anthropology at university so i sort of from mind this. This poet.

124
00:12:29,65 --> 00:12:32,16
Anthropologist historian recording and.

125
00:12:32,16 --> 00:12:39,2
Coloring or trying to do justice of the color of the things and the people around me here. So you think. Oh.

126
00:12:55,27 --> 00:13:01,97
Many people came here many artists and performers have come to nimbin. Over the last two decades.

127
00:13:02,68 --> 00:13:08,00
You know for many of the you know sydney brisbane melbourne. The capital cities.

128
00:13:08,00 --> 00:13:13,42
But it's usually been a great diversity to them which i think as the time was gone on. This is.

129
00:13:13,42 --> 00:13:16,62
This is being one of the magical things about the place here.

130
00:13:16,62 --> 00:13:21,35
I think newman would have been very boring if you had you know two thousand people all saying bob dylan

131
00:13:21,35 --> 00:13:29,92
and all cat stevens and not much else. But i think the diversity here. Of things here is that we are a rural community.

132
00:13:30,49 --> 00:13:35,24
Whatever else newman might be it is that. Are slighted just by the geography of it. But it's you know.

133
00:13:35,24 --> 00:13:38,16
Twenty miles to the nearest large town.

134
00:13:38,16 --> 00:13:40,74
And the dumb as the musical

135
00:13:40,74 --> 00:13:45,16
and artistic community here people became thrown together who in other situations in towns

136
00:13:45,16 --> 00:13:51,76
and cities wouldn't have been put together. And that made the. Interesting crossover of. You know.

137
00:13:52,62 --> 00:13:59,49
Indian percussionist playing with western folkies and. Kill to music i was playing with rock people and.

138
00:13:59,49 --> 00:14:05,59
Kill think music is playing with regard. And just. I think the larger events.

139
00:14:05,59 --> 00:14:10,61
And things like the name and all stars and the name and folk lab. Started rapping a lot of the.

140
00:14:10,61 --> 00:14:15,64
The shoulders off the edges between the various performers. Such that. Now.

141
00:14:15,87 --> 00:14:18,79
I mean the differences in the bed chemistries are always there.

142
00:14:18,79 --> 00:14:23,16
And i grow too with the good things but i think it's got to a situation where.

143
00:14:23,16 --> 00:14:29,16
Across the board a lot of these music goes and other people can work together. In situations you wouldn't imagine.

144
00:14:29,16 --> 00:14:31,76
And also in the artistic situation where you can have.

145
00:14:31,76 --> 00:14:35,43
For example had a recent spring arts festival where there was a lot of.

146
00:14:35,43 --> 00:14:42,33
Arts crafts furniture woodwork ceramics jewelry and things on display but that was woven into a performance of.

147
00:14:42,89 --> 00:14:50,68
Of ensembles baroque ensembles classical ensembles jazz pianists. Poetry readings. Everyone garde dance groups.

148
00:14:50,68 --> 00:14:57,95
I mean to me i'm and speaking as the president of the newman school of arts incorporated. Which manages the whole.

149
00:14:57,95 --> 00:15:05,43
I think these are the magic of events the big ones that really have the attraction for the public. And the community.

150
00:15:05,43 --> 00:15:11,13
But also for the performers as well. And for the artist because.

151
00:15:11,13 --> 00:15:14,55
They do these things on a large scar i like to do things on this sort of scale

152
00:15:14,55 --> 00:15:18,42
but i think it it just draws people together on this bigger scale.

153
00:15:18,42 --> 00:15:23,85
And it makes them also for your part larger part of this. Of this larger artistic community.

154
00:15:23,85 --> 00:15:25,12
And gives them more respect.

155
00:15:25,12 --> 00:15:26,76
I think in a lot of wise for what they're doing

156
00:15:26,76 --> 00:15:30,21
and what others are doing because there is a chip on the shoulder bettany been.

157
00:15:30,21 --> 00:15:39,37
There's a lot of clay shows that the media. Readily fall into about anyone and. I think it's very easy to carry that.

158
00:15:39,37 --> 00:15:43,86
Like a clock around you was well rather than to say you were once the ones i'm worth.

159
00:15:44,14 --> 00:15:48,99
I mean it's ludicrous to my mind to point to the village like nimon inside that place has got a drug problem.

160
00:15:48,99 --> 00:15:55,16
When the whole world's got a drug problem. Or that place has got a problem with our tuna and so on and ploy people.

161
00:15:55,16 --> 00:15:59,41
Whereas it just seems to be a bit of a hive into these people and where they are all over the place.

162
00:15:59,41 --> 00:16:03,19
From the coast and land anywise. Just into the finger.

163
00:16:03,19 --> 00:16:10,27
Gets pointed to it in a bad way and i think the media is not helped a lot of the artist to feel.

164
00:16:10,27 --> 00:16:16,94
You know how they step back from that whereas i go back to the outside well now and. On a nimbin performance part.

165
00:16:16,94 --> 00:16:22,45
And that's what i do. And i find that. There's a fascination i go to sydney or melbourne.

166
00:16:22,45 --> 00:16:30,96
And there's an absolute trust and i shouldn. About. Nimbin and. Any anthropologist historian poets. Words about newman.

167
00:16:30,96 --> 00:16:37,74
I don't know what it is it's like. It's like the daytrippers. I mean newman's got a bad reputation in many wise.

168
00:16:37,74 --> 00:16:46,34
And yet. During any holiday period. Devolve hours in the commodore was in the day trippers with their world to do.

169
00:16:46,34 --> 00:16:53,54
White noise on. Reebok to. Jacuzzi families come out here on mass. Every holiday period.

170
00:16:53,54 --> 00:16:57,08
I don't know what they are trying their attraction is i can say why i come here.

171
00:16:57,22 --> 00:17:02,63
I don't know where they come for a bit of a day or i think in a bit of a. A bit of fun.

172
00:17:02,63 --> 00:17:05,07
And it's a bit shocking to some of them but and.

173
00:17:05,07 --> 00:17:10,48
It's somewhere between shock in korea also do you in a man's life cheaper than going to calcutta or or.

174
00:17:10,48 --> 00:17:14,48
If you're staying in byron bay do a day trip to nimbin and. Go back home feeling.

175
00:17:14,75 --> 00:17:18,91
Rest assured in your mortgage and they are spec in sydney or melbourne that you've got.

176
00:17:18,91 --> 00:17:22,48
It's a strange thing some people come here expecting the worst in a very quiet here

177
00:17:22,48 --> 00:17:29,27
and other people come in are actually open minded and. And think it's is wonderful sort of smorgasbord.

178
00:17:29,27 --> 00:17:48,77
Pot pourri of things going on here. Pretty much everywhere from you know.

179
00:17:48,77 --> 00:17:57,52
Doctors are not all or some people within speak badly of nimbin and.

180
00:17:57,52 --> 00:18:01,82
Don't like the clichés about it and some people were very defensive of their town.

181
00:18:01,82 --> 00:18:06,27
But i think most people when someone comes in has only been here for twenty minutes and a cup of coffee and.

182
00:18:06,27 --> 00:18:12,27
And bad mouth the place before they're in their car driving or why. I don't think anyone really likes that.

183
00:18:12,27 --> 00:18:18,34
But i think also we're a bit. World weary. Just with the necessity of. The obvious spare.

184
00:18:18,34 --> 00:18:21,64
Front page headline which just. Points things in one wise.

185
00:18:21,64 --> 00:18:26,48
One why because i think what's really got to be stressed is that newman is a very complicated place.

186
00:18:27,05 --> 00:18:31,68
It's not a one dimensional place at all. It's a very complex place.

187
00:18:31,68 --> 00:18:37,75
And i really think the best and worst of people come here and the best and worst of things happened here.

188
00:18:37,75 --> 00:18:41,09
And it's almost a nightmare of it. There is a certain.

189
00:18:41,09 --> 00:18:45,5
There is more than a certain there's quite a degree of tolerance. Of other things.

190
00:18:45,5 --> 00:18:51,11
But of course within that this great deal of intolerance. But i think that's always been very apparent here.

191
00:18:51,11 --> 00:18:57,05
Is that there's a very diverse. Lot of people of come here just like the y.

192
00:18:57,05 --> 00:19:00,87
Eaves of people have come here the original hippies the whole influx of.

193
00:19:00,87 --> 00:19:05,5
Sort of newcastle lots that came in the light seventy early eighty's and the how.

194
00:19:05,5 --> 00:19:08,55
What you'd have to call sort of yuppie a step bush family.

195
00:19:08,55 --> 00:19:12,16
Four wheel drive people actually came here with money and property and.

196
00:19:12,16 --> 00:19:19,38
And plans even if all those players didn't match their expectations. But there's been many stages of. Of changes.

197
00:19:19,38 --> 00:19:25,83
Just like right now in not in ninety two going to ninety three there's a great deal of china is in development an

198
00:19:25,83 --> 00:19:33,13
expansion systems and recycling the garbage and running but power companies and. Perma culture developments.

199
00:19:33,13 --> 00:19:37,58
The expectations around how all these things will go i think is a bit.

200
00:19:37,58 --> 00:19:42,79
I don't think i think it's a big question mark in many people's eyes about what's going to happen.

201
00:19:42,79 --> 00:19:45,09
But then again i'm going our look around this.

202
00:19:45,09 --> 00:19:47,76
These hills in this bowl shaped valley we're in here

203
00:19:47,76 --> 00:19:51,51
and i see this is going to be quite a city here in twenty years time.

204
00:19:51,51 --> 00:19:55,48
Whether we like it or not just by a crush of population alone.

205
00:19:55,48 --> 00:20:00,08
And by the attraction of the fact that people keep pouring in here.

206
00:20:00,08 --> 00:20:05,2
With their yuppie day trippers with people looking to get out of the city looking for a lane.

207
00:20:05,2 --> 00:20:14,51
Whether they're the german backpackers. You know. It just comes and comes and it comes all the time. Because there's.

208
00:20:14,81 --> 00:20:34,72
It's what you call a person. In some wise a sense we have to prove it.

209
00:20:34,72 --> 00:20:40,22
As souls but of course there isn't any acoustic thing in nimbin other than earth to prove anything.

210
00:20:40,22 --> 00:20:42,66
And the rest of the world's pretty stuff to any why.

211
00:20:42,84 --> 00:20:49,18
So i mean they can't really come around pointing fingers here when everything else is such a mess a messy elsewhere.

212
00:20:49,18 --> 00:20:54,27
But neumann's been very very sort of quintessential even.

213
00:20:54,27 --> 00:21:00,69
In the home builders in the forest actions and many other chinese in hand birthing.

214
00:21:00,69 --> 00:21:04,26
Lots of things that actually stem from that that have had influences in some ways.

215
00:21:04,26 --> 00:21:07,89
A large influence in other areas apart from here.

216
00:21:07,89 --> 00:21:12,53
But even the new perma culture developments if they come out anything like the ideal.

217
00:21:12,53 --> 00:21:17,75
These are really important aspects that. That have a larger effect on australian culture.

218
00:21:26,45 --> 00:21:31,2
Nimbin audiences can be very very tough audiences.

219
00:21:31,2 --> 00:21:41,1
Especially for the fact that so many people have performed here in so many groups from you know. Maybe trippy cosmic.

220
00:21:41,1 --> 00:21:51,05
Religious people. Findhorn people. Slim dusty. All sorts of people have come here. Dance groups overseas groups.

221
00:21:51,05 --> 00:21:53,52
Theatre groups. One man shows.

222
00:21:53,52 --> 00:21:58,56
A lot of people and i think it's a bit of a testing ground for many performers and theatre groups and.

223
00:21:58,56 --> 00:22:01,08
Music those who are on tour.

224
00:22:01,08 --> 00:22:05,34
Going up the eastern coast are heading for brisbane or festivals in queensland or whatever and i think our name

225
00:22:05,34 --> 00:22:09,44
but what we can always do is showing nimbin but neumann's had.

226
00:22:09,44 --> 00:22:14,51
You know there's an attitude in him and you know i've been there seen that done that and.

227
00:22:14,52 --> 00:22:18,83
I mean you've got to promote things already hook into things to attract people to things because so much does happen

228
00:22:18,83 --> 00:22:21,64
here. And human is a bit world weary.

229
00:22:21,64 --> 00:22:25,35
And of course the recession is bodying as deep as anywhere else and there are a lot of.

230
00:22:25,35 --> 00:22:31,62
There are a lot of poor people living in this area. Much as i'd like to be in a time in even coming forward.

231
00:22:31,62 --> 00:22:47,47
To keep the car going to get to the end of time and little loan to pay to get in the door. Around.

232
00:22:47,47 --> 00:22:51,95
This first poem i wrote in the summer of not in seventy seven. And it's called.

233
00:22:51,95 --> 00:23:00,67
It's a tip always a poem is a better name and this is called the holy and the oldie and the oily tao. We are.

234
00:23:00,67 --> 00:23:09,84
But praise and blame. Said stephen. Of the famous found. To know right of reply. Save each day's. Words.

235
00:23:09,84 --> 00:23:19,67
Or love or lack all along this line from. Musically gumboots. To house. Couse the slaughter. Intense.

236
00:23:19,67 --> 00:23:29,51
We reshuffle the deck. Of choice. And chance. Rather ruled by. Meetings and encounter. Then. Would we trust leaders.

237
00:23:29,51 --> 00:23:41,63
For no one could be everyone. Thus. Stalking simplicity. Through complexity. Count. Just count. Contrary to contrary.

238
00:23:42,18 --> 00:23:53,89
For ever diverse our ways we spread out spontaneous. Structure. Survival. Vs creativity. Alone. Versus children.

239
00:23:53,89 --> 00:24:01,65
And what point of balance twixt all this. Never still for long enough of everything rainbow.

240
00:24:01,65 --> 00:24:12,11
And zodiacs do you rush this town along the way side. The real estate sign reads fast food. Country.

241
00:24:12,11 --> 00:24:21,57
So often blind to the song of the slow. Creeks and rivers of moon walking the night sky. And breeze.

242
00:24:21,57 --> 00:24:31,05
Invaders to the land way. Just like the others. And black men gone. And forest gone. And he'll slide away wrinkled.

243
00:24:31,05 --> 00:24:45,77
Fall and fall. And the valleys sing. Of pieces torn or why. We invade. And next of course. We invaded by technology.

244
00:24:45,77 --> 00:24:55,22
Man ploughs. The time. We invade ourselves. We invade ourselves. But all settlers eyes.

245
00:24:55,22 --> 00:25:02,38
Trace only the figures ever walking the one street. So many drifters and buy in arms and barefoot.

246
00:25:02,38 --> 00:25:07,18
The colors in the clothes and the crazies. Wrapped in blankets and.

247
00:25:07,18 --> 00:25:17,55
Mud to for shoes and dreams of guitar blues or heroin do you use the past of the ol shadows.

248
00:25:17,55 --> 00:25:30,28
And which way shall we be in this. Painted. New mythological. Town. And some many yet to come from womb or wheels.

249
00:25:30,28 --> 00:25:41,87
Or wondering why. Open or closed. Which way shall we be wanting to be fair and fine and friendly.

250
00:25:41,87 --> 00:25:49,27
Yet not flooded by the highway. Flow and peace in the valley. And peace at home.

251
00:25:49,27 --> 00:26:03,79
To blend and be in feel freedom not to have icky. Trying this last notion of primitive touch. Of trust and trials.

252
00:26:03,79 --> 00:26:23,23
Of community. Not to ninety five. Fly. Night at rainbow's brained. The one rule. In the town. Is the right to rule.

253
00:26:23,23 --> 00:26:29,96
The moral is let it slide i from pub. To rainbow half. Across the village street.

254
00:26:29,96 --> 00:26:39,8
The bandage hands during tea with a serene and stays the only safe place. And stage type tonight. The d.

255
00:26:39,8 --> 00:26:47,36
Frocked swamis corey haim. Says he is drunk. Dance raging for all out on the floor.

256
00:26:47,36 --> 00:26:54,52
And looking up from the world of east he cries e i guess he flies on the hundred other eyes in the room

257
00:26:54,52 --> 00:27:04,53
and the rush of the show into overload. And number two mad eyes. Unwashed for a week. On the sly.

258
00:27:04,53 --> 00:27:14,29
And none going to even hold his eyes. To ask is nine. So alone and so much pain for all. A word or conned.

259
00:27:14,89 --> 00:27:21,09
Or company again. Melting into the corners. And the night rocks on.

260
00:27:21,09 --> 00:27:29,8
And wrecks some the ben jamming too fast and slow but holds the feel of friends. And the fights tonight.

261
00:27:29,8 --> 00:27:32,38
And the night rocks on to the midnight hour.

262
00:27:32,38 --> 00:27:42,02
Out the door and down the hill into the borrowed veranda bed limb still pumping and mind. Counting on the drums.

263
00:27:43,14 --> 00:27:51,24
Shifting sleepless across the name been i. The town rooster crows on the hour. And from cox chorus.

264
00:27:51,24 --> 00:28:00,36
Up the valley to old sun rise. Where it comes through the sheets. And the village stays back with another face.

265
00:28:00,36 --> 00:28:06,69
For every day. With mother wheat and mother child. Father free. And roof.

266
00:28:06,69 --> 00:28:16,16
Does droop and the fall and people are planted like we. It's in the power. And high. Day.

267
00:28:16,16 --> 00:28:30,87
Out of town and diode is easy. Over the miles. Back to the house. Above the sea. Into sanctuary and slowly.

268
00:28:33,34 --> 00:28:44,34
A potted history. Of a day. In the life of newman. And it came to pass on the eighth moon. Of the seventy second year.

269
00:28:44,34 --> 00:28:55,00
Of the twentieth century of the most. Published. God. That the conservative government. That would not conserve. Fail.

270
00:28:55,00 --> 00:29:04,08
And the house of god did rule the land of milk and wheat and sheep do. And they did give the new year.

271
00:29:04,08 --> 00:29:13,23
To the vietnam war. And they did fly on wein's of. Petrel. Their troubled sons from the jungles of blood and.

272
00:29:13,23 --> 00:29:23,62
Fear and herbicides. Back to the beer. And bosom. Of their suburbs. But for many the bosom had withered on the created.

273
00:29:23,62 --> 00:29:33,94
Card of desire. And the cake. Of ambition and career tasted of toxin. And cason and gin and boredom. Of a sudden.

274
00:29:33,94 --> 00:29:42,66
Did flow from the river. Of the aquarian jug. Scouts and ambassadors of dunster men allen and peter stuyvesant.

275
00:29:42,66 --> 00:29:49,65
Who did come upon the village of nim been in the valley of malcolm in the dark i have shattered trees

276
00:29:49,65 --> 00:29:59,24
and slaughtered beef and banana spray and braved the feudal lords. And the scouts did call. And trumpet.

277
00:29:59,24 --> 00:30:07,55
Through the land. Of this company. Of rainbow power. Of this one alternative why.

278
00:30:07,55 --> 00:30:16,22
That coursed and co all their clans from the towns in the cities smoke. And those are ponderous. Mushroom.

279
00:30:16,22 --> 00:30:22,89
And slept face first in the dark. It was a band of gypsies playing in the rain.

280
00:30:22,89 --> 00:30:29,17
And they gave the see to each other and they filed. The government of papers.

281
00:30:29,17 --> 00:30:40,32
And they moved in cars and vans and sandals and barefoot. And bare breasted. Upon the land. Some came running. Gladly.

282
00:30:40,32 --> 00:30:53,45
Or madly been changing names. And colors. And gods. Changing the gods. Into grass castle kings and herbal flings.

283
00:30:53,45 --> 00:31:05,46
And a free flight of raining forest. A moon dance of market. Days are flood. And fire and frost. The cascade of sleep.

284
00:31:05,46 --> 00:31:15,94
The bursting of by the. Over the hills. Of the far away. Tree. And in the time. They turned to find the tweezers.

285
00:31:15,94 --> 00:31:19,55
To tug at the tick. From the tip of their dick.

286
00:31:19,55 --> 00:31:26,13
They had children and children's children that grow a coat of many colors about them.

287
00:31:26,13 --> 00:31:35,12
That waxed in the old wave of their waning aquarium. Waters. That wash. And feed the.
