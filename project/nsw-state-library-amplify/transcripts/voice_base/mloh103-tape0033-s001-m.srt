1
00:00:11,54 --> 00:00:36,4
Well. Jay and. All of a gentle of a man. And i became involved with the nimbin adventure. When it's early.

2
00:00:36,4 --> 00:00:41,71
And it's nice in stages in sydney when people were beginning to talk about a new.

3
00:00:41,71 --> 00:00:46,42
New form of festival for university and other students.

4
00:00:46,42 --> 00:00:52,87
And i was involved with a mad mob of people who believed that we had in suzy as in spirit an adventure to do things

5
00:00:52,87 --> 00:00:59,98
differently and i guess we really are certain i believe that we really could. Bring about social change.

6
00:01:01,11 --> 00:01:07,17
That would make for a better world for us so was and for. The various offspring that were beginning to appear.

7
00:01:07,17 --> 00:01:12,54
Around their fate at the time and it was a very exciting time for me.

8
00:01:12,54 --> 00:01:17,12
And i still hold a lot of that excitement i still hold a lot a lot of that idealism.

9
00:01:17,12 --> 00:01:23,11
And i'm at now apologize apologies. On that no apologies for being a nimbin hippie.

10
00:01:24,19 --> 00:01:31,91
Ok i live by the bitch bar and i you know. But i am a hippie doughton true. You know. Whatever the expression is.

11
00:01:32,43 --> 00:01:37,83
And i've had a lot of enjoyment. And a lot of learning from those times too in there.

12
00:01:38,98 --> 00:01:46,51
People often say have you got any regrets about the time you spent at noon then i think regretted smart girl.

13
00:01:47,76 --> 00:01:51,68
Nancy asking a question like that i think it's.

14
00:01:51,68 --> 00:01:57,31
It's been a wonderful social experiment it is a wonderful social experiment and i really believe that.

15
00:01:57,31 --> 00:02:00,83
Although lots of the things that we thought my occur.

16
00:02:00,83 --> 00:02:03,06
And some of the social change that we thought my occur

17
00:02:03,06 --> 00:02:06,93
and be more far reaching throughout a strike iran indeed the world.

18
00:02:06,93 --> 00:02:10,82
Even though those things some of those things haven't occurred. I still believe that humans are.

19
00:02:10,97 --> 00:02:13,02
Very influential santa.

20
00:02:13,02 --> 00:02:17,85
And what he does does formulate a lot of creative china on this north coast area

21
00:02:17,85 --> 00:02:31,54
and throughout the east coast of new south wales. Memories of the festival. Memories of the system a beautiful place.

22
00:02:31,54 --> 00:02:42,82
Magnificent weather center tested. Hundreds of little farm was not campsites not spread throughout the valley.

23
00:02:43,6 --> 00:02:54,03
Just directly behind him then it really felt quite tribal. It was very gentle. Wonderful into china's and.

24
00:02:54,03 --> 00:02:57,45
Creative people that were brought in specifically for the festival.

25
00:02:57,45 --> 00:03:00,44
And a lot of wonderful discussions and ideas it was a very a lot of talk

26
00:03:00,44 --> 00:03:05,67
and i mean you could spin from twenty four hours a day. Discussing interesting.

27
00:03:06,57 --> 00:03:16,51
Things with a number of different people. It was very very much of the image of long and. Far out folk.

28
00:03:16,51 --> 00:03:20,69
With women in long dresses and by visit their breasts and things like that.

29
00:03:20,69 --> 00:03:27,82
And of course that's something that i like to talk about lighter. Of demise.

30
00:03:27,82 --> 00:03:33,08
For me it was amazing just to be able to to live out in a beautiful country saudi area.

31
00:03:33,08 --> 00:03:37,63
With so many wonderful people i mean i think there's something like i thousand people so the estimates

32
00:03:37,63 --> 00:03:43,24
and guesstimates of the numbers who came through the system it was certainly a lot for a little term like newman i mean

33
00:03:43,24 --> 00:03:48,82
the streets were just chock a block with people you can barely get a vehicle. Down the the streets.

34
00:03:49,92 --> 00:04:00,58
Are in the silly pretty. Walking between the tomato sauce. And the nimbin pub. Juggling. Burning sticks.

35
00:04:00,58 --> 00:04:07,63
On the top rope that that that was from a part of the problem by the pole viral no this sort of thing.

36
00:04:07,63 --> 00:04:16,93
Dollar brand playing amazing far out. In the jazz piano in the nimbin hole and. I meant.

37
00:04:17,7 --> 00:04:23,28
Philip to take the guy riding his unicycle through the streets of nimbin and towards the showground.

38
00:04:23,28 --> 00:04:29,5
The hari krishna is wandering around singing in the sleigh for hours providing amazing meals. And then.

39
00:04:29,5 --> 00:04:38,01
The hari krishna is being followed by a group of sort of. Far out hippies with gambits going.

40
00:04:38,01 --> 00:04:42,73
Everybody tolerating everybody i mean it really pushed a lot of people's buttons in terms of toleration.

41
00:04:42,73 --> 00:04:49,62
I remember the police attempting to arrest people for drugs. Which always seemed to me from my.

42
00:04:49,62 --> 00:04:56,98
Very close proximity to the event that it was a planned. And by simply the people. Said no. We will control the.

43
00:04:56,98 --> 00:05:04,1
People are not dealing drugs it is not a drugs. And just by sickly.

44
00:05:04,1 --> 00:05:06,77
Issuing the police releasing the people who were arrested.

45
00:05:06,77 --> 00:05:12,23
Or who had been apprehended they weren't arrested and was a very powerful tahn that why.

46
00:05:12,23 --> 00:05:15,76
There was the learning unit where people would put up. Interesting areas that.

47
00:05:15,76 --> 00:05:22,39
On a blackboard that they were interested in discussing. Giving a seminar on a whatever. And it was a very long time.

48
00:05:22,39 --> 00:05:29,69
Lots of wonderful music here there and everywhere and we went to a way out extended family group. From the city.

49
00:05:29,69 --> 00:05:32,96
We had set up a.

50
00:05:32,96 --> 00:05:35,99
Area where we had a communal far communal kitchen

51
00:05:35,99 --> 00:05:42,76
and all our tents all around so any time you want to do a little bit of some comfort you could just want.

52
00:05:42,76 --> 00:05:48,73
There and then be anything from you know. Half a dozen people to maybe thirty at meal time.

53
00:05:48,73 --> 00:05:55,55
Around and basically for many of us who had been rising nuclear families post world war two nuclear families.

54
00:05:55,55 --> 00:06:00,4
And some of us of course it had the experience of living communally that to live in this big.

55
00:06:00,4 --> 00:06:04,5
Expanded family will travel for them it was just wonderful. And it really did.

56
00:06:04,5 --> 00:06:10,82
Did show that people can live together harmoniously and happily and creatively and exotic. Sadly.

57
00:06:10,96 --> 00:06:15,6
It was surely for a short period of time and. Everybody's on good behavior.

58
00:06:15,6 --> 00:06:23,04
On the base the high returns like that but it was a really hopeful time. Due to fool of a name is a t.p.s.

59
00:06:23,04 --> 00:06:30,51
Covered in fat cat from the fields. People wandering around with video cameras and type recorders.

60
00:06:30,51 --> 00:06:40,84
I often wonder what happened to those uk us. Local shopkeepers and local townsfolk who had been very carefully and.

61
00:06:40,84 --> 00:06:44,12
Continually consulted about this process.

62
00:06:44,12 --> 00:06:50,45
I had no idea what that would what we had no idea what we were in for when we started setting it up.

63
00:06:50,45 --> 00:06:56,85
But i was sort of slightly shocked and bemused most of the time incredibly tolerant.

64
00:06:56,85 --> 00:07:02,76
Dieties cafe daisy stuart his somebody. I would hope you have talked with and.

65
00:07:02,76 --> 00:07:05,27
Was one of those examples of she told us. The smiths.

66
00:07:05,68 --> 00:07:09,49
Molly smith molly and tom smith used to live on the one street in town millions myth about.

67
00:07:09,49 --> 00:07:16,87
Molly and tom about did now. That spirit charter's mother and father. And the child is still in town.

68
00:07:16,87 --> 00:07:19,94
With their daughter and running they had was to.

69
00:07:19,94 --> 00:07:25,08
Molly smith and tom smith sitting right in the middle of it their little bent. Is right in the.

70
00:07:25,08 --> 00:07:28,44
The entrance to their once shop now. Then house.

71
00:07:28,44 --> 00:07:32,5
Which is now than in the new gallery known in second hand goods gallery.

72
00:07:32,5 --> 00:07:35,23
That would sit there and i would say things like.

73
00:07:35,23 --> 00:07:42,58
He wants to say this is the best color television in the whole of the world. And i sincerely believed it.

74
00:07:42,58 --> 00:07:50,35
And i went they were happy. I mean a lot of they all thomas as. That were cold. Although bemused shocked.

75
00:07:50,35 --> 00:07:58,13
Scared or whatever we're really delighted to see the. Darling tan. Re. Generating. You know.

76
00:07:58,13 --> 00:08:01,71
So many of those old people's i had seen. Many of their children.

77
00:08:01,71 --> 00:08:06,18
Where they've ended grandchildren moved away from the area because there's nothing holding them in nimbin it was a

78
00:08:06,18 --> 00:08:12,74
daunting rundown. Falling to pieces all wooden buildings town very quiet for the. But to say any.

79
00:08:12,74 --> 00:08:15,5
Teenage kids living there was lucky. There.

80
00:08:15,5 --> 00:08:20,3
And so to say this new energy coming a lot i had no idea what it was about a way it was heading.

81
00:08:20,3 --> 00:08:22,68
Really quite supportive. Because i could remember.

82
00:08:22,68 --> 00:08:28,68
For example where we lived in paradise valley where we have entry we bought land just before the festival.

83
00:08:28,68 --> 00:08:34,08
At the end of craft and rode on the blue no where we live we were the last people along the road.

84
00:08:34,08 --> 00:08:42,15
Now that they were where we believe. Many years ago. Twenty italian families beyond us. Into the valley living.

85
00:08:42,67 --> 00:08:45,74
So the number had seen very populated towns

86
00:08:45,74 --> 00:08:51,29
and then people had wandered away again it was a big part of the dairy industry and a lot of the modeling industry.

87
00:08:55,19 --> 00:09:03,02
We were the new push for sure. And we was probably in many ways as. Many of us was disrespectful as any modern to push.

88
00:09:03,02 --> 00:09:11,39
When there isn't. Another word as we were very respectful. I was really happy to be associated with people.

89
00:09:11,39 --> 00:09:13,63
Paradise valley and.

90
00:09:13,63 --> 00:09:21,12
That was my extended family for many many years and many of those people still are extended family.

91
00:09:21,12 --> 00:09:26,51
Because we always we made a policy of really informing people about what we were about we felt that information was

92
00:09:26,51 --> 00:09:34,72
part of our political ideology that if you have full information then you. You don't get into trouble.

93
00:09:34,72 --> 00:09:38,17
Because if everybody has the full information people afraid to make decisions.

94
00:09:38,17 --> 00:09:42,57
With full information so we decided almost as a policy it was not written policy

95
00:09:42,57 --> 00:09:48,08
or anything like that that we would tell all and i was in local to about who we were and what we were bad.

96
00:09:48,08 --> 00:09:54,49
And we found that bottling asos up. To people like that they were very welcoming totally supportive of us i mean.

97
00:09:54,49 --> 00:10:00,6
The generosity that we received when we first moved to the area was it was almost embarrassing committees and we go

98
00:10:00,6 --> 00:10:05,93
and visit our next door neighbor's lawn dudley harris. You know. Tardily room. You know.

99
00:10:05,93 --> 00:10:13,21
Hippies from the city come to sort of. You know. Survival mode where the typical. Image. And i would give this.

100
00:10:13,21 --> 00:10:20,22
We would walk away with docks and trucks and fresh vegetables from the gardens and preserve and jans and i mean it was.

101
00:10:20,22 --> 00:10:26,00
Was really embarrassing and what could you give these people back i mean you know i raised my first crop of beans.

102
00:10:26,00 --> 00:10:32,65
You know this very exhausted lee and sort of. Was it really appropriate to take them down to somebody.

103
00:10:32,65 --> 00:10:37,24
Not just brains but sort of day. And things like that.

104
00:10:37,24 --> 00:10:42,32
You know and other others all sorts of funny stories come to my mind you know real in the style to stuff like.

105
00:10:43,81 --> 00:10:53,17
Tell about the truck. That you're ok so we decided to raise chooks. Because we wanted to have fresh eggs.

106
00:10:53,17 --> 00:10:55,2
Free range fresh eggs. Chooks to wait.

107
00:10:55,97 --> 00:11:01,93
So we acquired from charlie soured who was the local tip man who's quite a character. You've encountered.

108
00:11:01,93 --> 00:11:09,99
Who was the truck. King by sickly of. The whole region. And we acquired five trucks and.

109
00:11:09,99 --> 00:11:13,43
At that stage we had no record to drive up to a humble dwelling.

110
00:11:13,43 --> 00:11:17,55
So we had to walk up a very steep hill across the creek and off a very steep hill.

111
00:11:17,55 --> 00:11:24,69
And in the haze of summer john and i carried in his bags these chucks you know very close to put trucks in his eyes

112
00:11:24,69 --> 00:11:28,79
but what about them you know. We carried them up the hill and finally got them up there.

113
00:11:28,79 --> 00:11:34,19
And we liberated them into the newly created. Trippin.

114
00:11:34,19 --> 00:11:38,91
With beautiful he touches like you know gold bowls and things like that.

115
00:11:38,91 --> 00:11:44,33
Run those signs out of the door you know i mean we really wanted welcome at us. One of them.

116
00:11:44,33 --> 00:11:47,92
Had god what do you do with the truck.

117
00:11:48,49 --> 00:11:54,76
Well this truck was perfectly all right before we had begun our since i trudged over to

118
00:11:54,76 --> 00:11:57,21
and i was with you know probably that quote of an ad.

119
00:11:57,21 --> 00:12:00,18
But there was something like this it's what do i do with the truck that's dead

120
00:12:00,18 --> 00:12:05,82
and she said well it's alright your pockets. Yes i know but how do you apply.

121
00:12:05,82 --> 00:12:12,6
So she sort of told me how you plucked it and so i then tried to back up the hill and five. Q ok.

122
00:12:12,6 --> 00:12:22,37
With pliers we're playing. It's failing health. It's york. I'm thinking. This is a self sufficient.

123
00:12:22,37 --> 00:12:26,83
She had a missing to tell me that you plan to choke him a lot more.

124
00:12:26,83 --> 00:12:32,18
Assume that i quit this by sixty so eventually i think i'd gone back to ask her again

125
00:12:32,18 --> 00:12:34,59
and so i learned that yes your plans that you can cause

126
00:12:34,59 --> 00:12:40,5
and poured boiling hot water for too long so by the time this feathers were plucked out this chick was killing

127
00:12:40,5 --> 00:12:47,67
and back and then you know had to gothe it which was something i hadn't encountered before.

128
00:12:47,67 --> 00:12:56,31
I mean i can remember john and i laughing hilariously at the top. But also there was a slight element of despair.

129
00:12:58,2 --> 00:13:06,04
So we were very wrong. But very very enthusiastic and we were quite determined that we were going to get.

130
00:13:06,04 --> 00:13:12,63
When it is cut that well i said about it.

131
00:13:12,63 --> 00:13:22,37
With a had thomas living in him than being a hippie and i can come united mean. Of course there were hard times.

132
00:13:22,37 --> 00:13:28,7
It's funny how things were you know like you tend to repress the unpleasant memories i don't think i've done that i

133
00:13:28,7 --> 00:13:37,19
think i just put them into a different kind of perspective. Perhaps we lived communally and the household that.

134
00:13:37,19 --> 00:13:40,38
Harry invests in john and i build the kind the communal household.

135
00:13:40,38 --> 00:13:43,65
And many more and as people built their houses many of them.

136
00:13:43,65 --> 00:13:48,97
Used back each in an bathroom as the kitchen and bathroom all the rest everything there and it was really that.

137
00:13:48,97 --> 00:13:58,53
The communities. One house. So many. Everybody would pass. In and out of it and. It was nothing for us to have.

138
00:13:59,43 --> 00:14:05,86
Twenty people to dinner. It was a frequent event. And that was a very happy event. But it was also a very.

139
00:14:05,86 --> 00:14:10,82
Energy consuming event. We had lots of kids. We had a very good ratio of adults to keep.

140
00:14:10,97 --> 00:14:17,68
That is we had many more adults to kids. Very healthy rich. Relationship i think. In that it meant they were usually.

141
00:14:17,68 --> 00:14:21,64
Every kid always had some adult. Happy to be available to them.

142
00:14:21,64 --> 00:14:26,19
You might be getting on particularly well with your mom. Well you just could avoid.

143
00:14:26,19 --> 00:14:32,07
And go and spend some time with somebody else who. Welcome you with open eyes. So the kids had a good time of it.

144
00:14:32,07 --> 00:14:39,91
And i think we our law think i did too that the had tons will. Working at the spot stresses and the difficulties.

145
00:14:39,91 --> 00:14:48,61
We were very functional i think in terms of avoiding the sorts of stresses a lot of.

146
00:14:48,61 --> 00:14:54,58
Shared households or communal households often encounter. I mean we just had god laws you know.

147
00:14:54,58 --> 00:15:00,41
Wasn't a rule it was just how we accepted. Each other's laws and how it come to live together at the minute.

148
00:15:00,41 --> 00:15:03,89
And that was because we lived together in a city many of us before that.

149
00:15:03,89 --> 00:15:10,22
You didn't leave the washing up on the sink things like that so you never. We just had that is sort of dice.

150
00:15:10,22 --> 00:15:16,93
So we never had that kind of stress so it was a it was a great spirit of generosity with the people that are if we

151
00:15:16,93 --> 00:15:24,3
didn't. And that spirit of generosity was very important. Spirit of generosity towards each other as adults.

152
00:15:24,3 --> 00:15:30,52
Spirit of generosity towards each other's kids. Spirit of generosity towards each other's friends and relatives.

153
00:15:32,26 --> 00:15:40,53
Some of the hard times i think when they were not having enough space to take my space away. My privacy.

154
00:15:40,53 --> 00:15:44,49
And i don't necessarily think that's anybody else's fault of of my own for not wanting to.

155
00:15:44,49 --> 00:15:47,7
I don't want to miss out on any of the action in a way and none of us did.

156
00:15:49,1 --> 00:15:56,22
We had lots of issues to work out of that around money. What sequel. Some of us went out to work.

157
00:15:56,22 --> 00:16:00,44
In philly holly paid jobs others others of us were staying home and building.

158
00:16:01,01 --> 00:16:05,35
Being the home people where is the equity there. We never really fully address those issues.

159
00:16:05,35 --> 00:16:10,82
And i was unfairly had tons. When relationships. Also than many of them. Broke up.

160
00:16:12,12 --> 00:16:18,22
Which is not an on an unusual event for any body in the series oh now even of course you know if you're in a personal

161
00:16:18,22 --> 00:16:24,5
relationship it was in cross of course that affected everybody else and i were some very difficult times for us as.

162
00:16:24,5 --> 00:16:27,34
Community members. It was hard building you know.

163
00:16:27,34 --> 00:16:32,86
Physically getting out there and building fences and bridges and have.

164
00:16:32,86 --> 00:16:41,01
From by a lot of people who bicycling the academics. I think we were academics and continued.

165
00:16:41,01 --> 00:16:46,44
Well that we had a sort of activities that we did many of us have continued to the that sort of.

166
00:16:46,44 --> 00:16:54,35
Lawn that were there originally. So yeah they were had time. There was some very hated.

167
00:16:55,47 --> 00:17:02,83
Times around how do you discipline children. And that was a very interesting thing although it was hard at times.

168
00:17:02,83 --> 00:17:07,26
It was a very again the spirit of generosity was there and.

169
00:17:07,26 --> 00:17:15,05
A lot of people found it difficult to have a logical parent for example. Interact with a young child. In the distant.

170
00:17:15,05 --> 00:17:17,41
Disciplinary or limit setting talk of why.

171
00:17:17,97 --> 00:17:24,29
And i'm not think i learned very quickly i've had the privilege of living with young children before i had my own.

172
00:17:24,29 --> 00:17:29,57
And so i had been in that role of being prepared to be committed to children in that way of setting limits.

173
00:17:29,57 --> 00:17:34,13
Because it is a commitment to be prepared to go through the thick and the thin not just.

174
00:17:34,13 --> 00:17:37,21
If we can in not just being nice friends all the time.

175
00:17:37,21 --> 00:17:42,99
So the time my kids came along i was more experience with that but. To to watch somebody else.

176
00:17:42,99 --> 00:17:49,97
Disciplining old setting limits with your own child which my be a raging battle between i struck a four year old

177
00:17:49,97 --> 00:17:56,31
and a fairly adamant. Adult and trust that process and does to people have a commitment.

178
00:17:56,31 --> 00:17:59,72
Particularly adult to the child commitment. Kids never had any difficulty.

179
00:17:59,72 --> 00:18:03,3
Committing themselves to anybody that would love them. But to watch that.

180
00:18:03,3 --> 00:18:08,39
And now that they had it was so committed to the child that. Even if that were in the eye.

181
00:18:08,39 --> 00:18:11,92
Stressful situation that they would with their own spice. Tom.

182
00:18:11,92 --> 00:18:16,66
Come back to being with that child seeing that child on the in a loving that child

183
00:18:16,66 --> 00:18:22,54
and coming back to the loving relationship. And letting what had passed. Be passed.

184
00:18:22,54 --> 00:18:28,59
So that was all that could be seen as difficult as some about this growing times.

185
00:18:28,59 --> 00:18:34,5
And in light is some people who came to the community with all the children who hadn't had that experience of having

186
00:18:34,5 --> 00:18:40,62
the kids commune. Children from very from birth or from very early on i think found that very difficult.

187
00:18:40,62 --> 00:18:47,04
And i found that more stressful than anything that ever occurred to me with my kids.

188
00:18:47,04 --> 00:18:53,92
And it's really interesting to see has social conditioning. Gets laid down very easily. And very early.

189
00:18:53,92 --> 00:19:01,41
Like i think john has a very good example. And so he's a very good example of kids who were commune kids and.

190
00:19:01,41 --> 00:19:05,41
Really assume that any adults that were around were available to them.

191
00:19:05,41 --> 00:19:13,48
I really would kids who went through that now i want mommy to get me the sort of. Spies. If there was an adult.

192
00:19:13,48 --> 00:19:20,98
Oh at all a pair of legs by sickly around. Who can provide for them that particular night i would ask court and.

193
00:19:22,09 --> 00:19:25,84
So some of those difficulties of people working at their relationships to children

194
00:19:25,84 --> 00:19:28,44
and things like that might have been difficulties but the.

195
00:19:28,44 --> 00:19:33,26
The long term effect was a very positive and a very healthy one adelaide.

196
00:19:49,81 --> 00:19:55,35
Well so may i was prepared to put pretty well everything up for grabs. Theoretically anyway.

197
00:19:55,35 --> 00:20:02,52
And i think it's taken me a long time to even consider some of the areas that i didn't think you needed analysis at the

198
00:20:02,52 --> 00:20:09,36
time and still do. Yeah. And just being. Always an urban dweller. All of my life.

199
00:20:11,58 --> 00:20:17,78
And to move to the country was a very expensive experience for me it is the spice the freedom that that guy. Me.

200
00:20:17,78 --> 00:20:22,19
I could decide what to the old where ever a lot. That was fantastic. So.

201
00:20:22,19 --> 00:20:25,98
On those sorts of physical parameters it was very new

202
00:20:25,98 --> 00:20:31,05
and i could make up anything i wanted to i wanted to build a large house that sort of had separate units too it was

203
00:20:31,05 --> 00:20:36,64
sort of connected by walkways and lots of people could happily ever after live in it. So i decided to do it.

204
00:20:36,64 --> 00:20:40,51
You know i mean i was sort of fairly fearless in that way i thought because will do it.

205
00:20:40,51 --> 00:20:41,83
Now when we went to council

206
00:20:41,83 --> 00:20:45,91
and said that these are all building plans you know we're doing it the right way we're doing it by the letter of the

207
00:20:45,91 --> 00:20:52,45
lore and all that something i don't know you can't do that and i said well we're going to. You know i mean i was.

208
00:20:52,45 --> 00:20:58,72
I wasn't being. Brash or nasty always just. But you know that's what i'm going to do it.

209
00:20:58,72 --> 00:21:03,92
Did you know mark and i saw him in the health inspector wally doctoring.

210
00:21:03,92 --> 00:21:06,51
It was a real problem to him so i learned very quickly.

211
00:21:06,51 --> 00:21:11,91
This man is very good at creating problems perhaps the best thing i can do is offer him the opportunity to solve a

212
00:21:11,91 --> 00:21:17,51
problem for me. So we presented it in that way and. After many many weeks of dollar.

213
00:21:17,51 --> 00:21:23,08
Negotiation he told us that we could actually do exactly what we had on paper. If we called it something else.

214
00:21:23,08 --> 00:21:29,96
And so we had this thing called most special residency. Occupancy buildings. Shrub's is that i've become.

215
00:21:30,75 --> 00:21:38,55
Thank you very much mr crean we said you know very politely we went away and. What we wanted to do. We thought we were.

216
00:21:38,55 --> 00:21:44,93
Well i was new to to create an extended family. Most of us had come from what we consider to be dysfunctional families.

217
00:21:44,93 --> 00:21:50,08
But. Or are there considered to be dysfunctional families and.

218
00:21:50,08 --> 00:21:56,42
We really felt that we could probably do it better together. I didn't seem that difficult a task.

219
00:21:56,42 --> 00:22:02,53
To live with people with gentle spirit generosity and to love each other to lock each other to love each other's kids.

220
00:22:02,53 --> 00:22:06,96
And to give kids the opportunity. Instead of having to be locked in that.

221
00:22:06,96 --> 00:22:14,09
Mom dad or mom just dad or just mama whatever you know sort of. The nuclear family even it was a single parent.

222
00:22:14,09 --> 00:22:20,87
Nuclear family rather than being locked in that. To be giving our kids the opportunity to have a much broader.

223
00:22:22,04 --> 00:22:27,6
Scope of people to choose their relationships from and to form their own form than their own selves from.

224
00:22:27,6 --> 00:22:35,34
You know i mean i was really quite happy to have and still them. To have any adults. Put in input. To the kids.

225
00:22:35,34 --> 00:22:37,18
And i figured that i'd like the.

226
00:22:37,18 --> 00:22:41,1
Intelligent choices along the way as to which were the best bits of everybody or everybody's attitudes and.

227
00:22:41,1 --> 00:22:49,27
As a result but probably come out to be really wonderful people. That's true. But i would i add to that question.

228
00:22:49,27 --> 00:23:04,78
Thriving. How can i pick you up on that. The statement was that it put a lot of strain on relationships.

229
00:23:04,78 --> 00:23:08,56
I don't know that that's true. I think living.

230
00:23:08,56 --> 00:23:21,54
Successfully with any and partner is quite an energy and emotion consuming experience. All of the lot.

231
00:23:21,54 --> 00:23:25,93
From those times. Because i not only was in a relationship.

232
00:23:25,93 --> 00:23:30,43
But out had the opportunity to view it very close quarters either and i should ships.

233
00:23:30,6 --> 00:23:36,09
It's true that many of those relationships most of those relationships no longer exist. But.

234
00:23:36,09 --> 00:23:39,22
Is that statistically different from anywhere else that. You know.

235
00:23:39,22 --> 00:23:44,41
I don't think it is it's not my observation i can remember reading statistics in the seventy's with.

236
00:23:46,61 --> 00:23:53,3
From the north coast area. Which i think. Said that sixty percent of school students.

237
00:23:53,3 --> 00:23:59,94
Think it was early ha school student. Hostel students. Sixty percent of the students kind from separated families.

238
00:23:59,94 --> 00:24:03,25
Now that was at the top on that was from the whole area this wasn't just me

239
00:24:03,25 --> 00:24:09,39
but that was at the time where it was still considered. We've had a marital breakdown.

240
00:24:09,39 --> 00:24:15,51
Or your relationships and it having do you from your from a separated family i you know you poor dear.

241
00:24:15,51 --> 00:24:19,73
You know that kind of attitude was still prevalent. Even the statistics were. To the contrary.

242
00:24:20,23 --> 00:24:23,46
And i can remember i think kerry coming home with that statistic of us discussing it

243
00:24:23,46 --> 00:24:28,1
and having a good ol chuckle knowing that. You know we had many friends and so.

244
00:24:28,1 --> 00:24:32,93
Who were in that category that we were actually in a majority as distinct from monarchy when. Once that because.

245
00:24:33,82 --> 00:24:40,06
So the actual question. Did it put a strain on relationships. Of course it put a strain. And a strain that.

246
00:24:40,06 --> 00:24:46,14
Nuclear families don't have. But it also contributed so much more to us as individuals.

247
00:24:46,14 --> 00:24:50,36
And you know why i think it gave many of us the freedom to move apart from each other

248
00:24:50,36 --> 00:24:56,68
and still try out he was brought to try to maintain civil friendly relationships. You know.

249
00:24:56,68 --> 00:25:04,47
Live with somebody for many many. And then just suddenly stop. And if you. If you.

250
00:25:04,47 --> 00:25:10,9
Born children with somebody you presumably. I mean assuming everybody is fairly. Thoughtful about their choices.

251
00:25:10,9 --> 00:25:14,57
You probably don't have kids with somebody who thinks an absolute idiot.

252
00:25:14,57 --> 00:25:20,18
Well then she will not say you know you actually have some regard and love that person at some stage along the way.

253
00:25:20,35 --> 00:25:21,02
And if that.

254
00:25:21,02 --> 00:25:26,85
No longer is happening it doesn't mean that you don't have to height that not have regard and respect for that person.

255
00:25:26,85 --> 00:25:34,52
So i and i have and i have been a contributing factor. I don't think so and contributing factor in relationships.

256
00:25:34,52 --> 00:25:36,43
Ending.

257
00:25:36,43 --> 00:25:38,89
But i think i was the opportunity to then go on

258
00:25:38,89 --> 00:25:43,78
and have respect for life in ships with their former partners who were often the parents of their children.

259
00:25:53,03 --> 00:25:57,7
Polygamy of this is monogamy. With with those issues of a result.

260
00:25:57,7 --> 00:26:03,94
Yes the add to that that's a yes and i think for some individuals. We've been able to come to.

261
00:26:03,94 --> 00:26:11,26
I mean some may for example i have a fairly clear attitude about my that my stance on that for others is i don't know

262
00:26:11,26 --> 00:26:13,35
whether that ever resolve the mill whether it's even a problem.

263
00:26:15,71 --> 00:26:22,18
We certainly talked about to talk about incest within the not insist. Was it.

264
00:26:22,18 --> 00:26:26,12
Not insist that's another issue to talk about. Which was certainly.

265
00:26:26,12 --> 00:26:32,16
We certainly encountered as some of us had relationships with each other at sort of a primary couple in.

266
00:26:32,16 --> 00:26:38,51
And most of us were primarily coupled on the outside. And that created havoc.

267
00:26:38,51 --> 00:26:41,87
And so there was an agreement that that we would not do that.

268
00:26:41,87 --> 00:26:46,1
This is i'm talking about just at paradise valley i mean there are plenty of other situations where people have done

269
00:26:46,1 --> 00:26:50,65
that they just cause too much stress. And too much lack of trust and breaking down.

270
00:26:50,65 --> 00:26:54,01
Too many of the good things that occurred. And some people never recovered.

271
00:26:54,01 --> 00:27:01,18
Never recovered on i think from some of those events that were too great and were that we didn't.

272
00:27:01,18 --> 00:27:06,64
We talked a lot about that i mean. I think my attitude has always been on the great. Emma goldman.

273
00:27:09,3 --> 00:27:09,5
Said

274
00:27:09,5 --> 00:27:15,97
and emma goldman was a feminist american three minutes from the early to the century right before that in a century

275
00:27:15,97 --> 00:27:21,32
and into. Ids. And she believed in free love.

276
00:27:21,32 --> 00:27:25,00
And people used to say you know hippies and free love and i mean i think i do believe in free love

277
00:27:25,00 --> 00:27:29,71
but i'd like to have the other side what i mean by that. And by that on main.

278
00:27:29,71 --> 00:27:32,07
I think people should be free to love

279
00:27:32,07 --> 00:27:38,3
and have intimate relationships including sexually intimate relationships with anybody that they truly love.

280
00:27:39,02 --> 00:27:45,49
As long as it isn't hurtful to anybody else. And if that. If that relationship is no longer truly loving.

281
00:27:45,59 --> 00:27:53,00
That's presumably appropriate for that kind of intimacy to china. And if that person. Then. Forms another.

282
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:58,15
Really close bond with somebody else. Then i should be free to be i would exercise that.

283
00:27:58,15 --> 00:28:05,87
Leave that relationship to its full flowering. If it. Which my also include. Which might include sexual intimacy.

284
00:28:05,87 --> 00:28:11,2
So that's what i mean by free love. I don't really have any attachment to.

285
00:28:11,2 --> 00:28:16,49
People staying together for the kids for example. I don't think that. Free love.

286
00:28:16,49 --> 00:28:27,09
Means that you don't make those choices without a great deal of thought. Care and consideration. Building my own.

287
00:28:27,09 --> 00:28:34,69
Lot to tell you my. I'd started off my university career as an academic student.

288
00:28:34,69 --> 00:28:39,46
And i decided i didn't want to be a designer of. Ticky tacky little boxes and.

289
00:28:39,46 --> 00:28:46,07
Not be putting kinko grey color schemes rather than blue and brown into government.

290
00:28:46,07 --> 00:28:50,14
Toilets and things like that i mean. I was in i was right in the year over woodson.

291
00:28:50,14 --> 00:28:53,6
And i realize the mess i was spectacular i would just be a very ordinary architect.

292
00:28:53,6 --> 00:28:57,79
I didn't think i was really spectacular in the architecture field.

293
00:28:58,08 --> 00:29:02,08
So i decided not to continue with architecture so i decided i'd really like to be a capital.

294
00:29:02,08 --> 00:29:06,96
And i went along and applied to do carpentry and joinery. Through the type system.

295
00:29:06,96 --> 00:29:14,1
And was told that there weren't enough toilets. Which i didn't exactly understand.

296
00:29:14,1 --> 00:29:16,61
His part of that story is that i thought i was missed. I thought.

297
00:29:16,61 --> 00:29:22,72
I thought i was mrs watson coming along for my dutch speaking husband who couldn't understand english.

298
00:29:22,72 --> 00:29:26,15
When it became clear that i was actually jack all of a.

299
00:29:26,15 --> 00:29:31,57
And i wanted to do it happened to be enjoyed and then i found out that they were not enough toilets. In the college.

300
00:29:31,57 --> 00:29:35,81
And i didn't really think that this particular bureaucratic problem had much to do with me

301
00:29:35,81 --> 00:29:42,57
and then i realised what the message was that we don't want. Women girls doing acca to doing. Catherine jointly.

302
00:29:42,57 --> 00:29:45,49
We don't want girls doing. Happen to enjoy so i sort of.

303
00:29:46,8 --> 00:29:51,1
That was good outcome and i very sheepishly sort of crawled away from that.

304
00:29:51,1 --> 00:29:54,66
So i guess you could say that i had this deep seated desire.

305
00:29:54,66 --> 00:29:59,42
To be involved with the audience from a very early age and.

306
00:29:59,42 --> 00:30:01,95
When i moved to the country was an opportunity to fulfill that.

307
00:30:01,95 --> 00:30:07,52
I went into industrial design after that and psychiatric nursing and all sorts of things.

308
00:30:07,52 --> 00:30:12,01
But when i moved to the country he was my opportunity to become involved in buildings.

309
00:30:12,01 --> 00:30:18,3
So i was very passionately and closely involved with the buildings of office building. And the first house.

310
00:30:18,3 --> 00:30:26,87
Which was a large extended hass. And i found it very tarring and almost impossible to build physically.

311
00:30:26,87 --> 00:30:35,59
While i was pregnant with cell. I suffered a great deal of. Twenty father. Morning north. Surely a mile to him.

312
00:30:35,59 --> 00:30:40,24
And i did a lot of the organization a lot of decision making but i didn't do much hands on stuff.

313
00:30:41,44 --> 00:30:46,96
When sally and john his dad. John and i decided to separate and.

314
00:30:46,96 --> 00:30:54,36
Move further apart from each other the obvious solution kind to me. And that was that i should build my own spice.

315
00:30:54,36 --> 00:30:56,51
And i can relate to the current communal house still.

316
00:30:56,51 --> 00:31:04,04
As long as we had our own spices we were good co-parent the kids underneath the sign sort of under the side hochman.

317
00:31:04,04 --> 00:31:09,79
But you know. But anyway. And so i decided to go myself a half so i may have to go to the family.

318
00:31:09,79 --> 00:31:15,04
But that's what i was going to do and everybody went. Ok. So i did. And i set myself a time limit.

319
00:31:16,22 --> 00:31:23,23
I decided i would build a house in twelve months working three days a week. Which meant. I needed to arrange.

320
00:31:23,23 --> 00:31:26,02
You know three days child free taught to do that so i did.

321
00:31:26,02 --> 00:31:28,82
So it was interesting for me because lots of issues were involved.

322
00:31:29,03 --> 00:31:33,18
It was me as a young mother beginning to negotiate child free tom.

323
00:31:33,18 --> 00:31:40,87
Although we were very committed to the notion of us all being equal. I was discovering that once you had children.

324
00:31:40,87 --> 00:31:44,8
A lot of those ideas sort of slipped out the door a bit.

325
00:31:44,8 --> 00:31:50,08
It was one of the issues for me that i wanted to have that in that respect of the quality.
