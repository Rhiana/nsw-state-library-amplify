1
00:00:14,28 --> 00:00:26,73
Ok let's just hope to have to start again. Well so we had an old man name is dismissed who was about to retire.

2
00:00:26,73 --> 00:00:30,63
And he decided he'd buy the smallest post office he could find and retire.

3
00:00:30,88 --> 00:00:34,66
So of course he bought the neiman post office and ended up here in the heyday.

4
00:00:34,66 --> 00:00:37,11
When the town was starting to brew

5
00:00:37,11 --> 00:00:43,51
and he would get the most ridiculous letters addressed to people like rain in the treehouse tenable falls

6
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:49,47
and he by the end of it he was quite speer he could very high blood pressure. He was really quite betty.

7
00:00:49,47 --> 00:00:53,81
And one morning i remember walking into the post office and he was throwing a tantrum.

8
00:00:53,81 --> 00:00:59,68
And he had hold someone across the counter by the shirt collar and was. You know. Screaming abuse at them.

9
00:00:59,68 --> 00:01:06,21
And he had another man that worked for him and i know who was. He was so mild mannered and me.

10
00:01:06,21 --> 00:01:07,71
Made me just check the wobblies

11
00:01:07,71 --> 00:01:13,24
and all that kind of looks don't face that you know one day i said to know how you deal with it you know i couldn't

12
00:01:13,24 --> 00:01:23,63
stand it. And he said i'll wait until it's no and around i go ahead on to the back step. And not piss me so full of.

13
00:01:23,63 --> 00:01:29,21
The coming days ago it was very going to the post-office and.

14
00:01:29,21 --> 00:01:40,41
Cross the counter and he says them back to mrs smith retired and sold it to another.

15
00:01:40,41 --> 00:01:43,16
Poor unfortunate man who now gets abused.

16
00:01:43,16 --> 00:01:52,36
The other day when i was being abused by some very out of it looking character. And that's quite a while wrist.

17
00:01:52,36 --> 00:01:57,65
It's like at the very center. It seems to be cyclic.

18
00:01:57,65 --> 00:02:05,49
To you know desire is it's just gorgeous and you couldn't ever imagine. She think.

19
00:02:05,49 --> 00:02:26,1
To seriously consider the direction where you can go from here. Especially when your friends got so bored.

20
00:02:26,1 --> 00:02:35,24
It's called the hundred word story. Like.

21
00:02:35,24 --> 00:02:43,73
Oh yes when we first started the rainbow cafe it wasn't as it appears to this day i had little room.

22
00:02:43,73 --> 00:02:47,43
That was still you know had their panties and things.

23
00:02:47,43 --> 00:02:54,29
And every saturday we would have to vacate one of these little rooms at the back in the sky. Coming.

24
00:02:54,29 --> 00:03:00,36
Plug his phone in and go in when we realized what he was jane because he's trying to keep us locked down

25
00:03:00,36 --> 00:03:08,64
but we were just to use him and. I've been don't pretend to own the place but there is no excuse made.

26
00:03:08,64 --> 00:03:09,74
I want to get changed

27
00:03:09,74 --> 00:03:14,83
and things like this because if we store some have to back it from another part of the back door

28
00:03:14,83 --> 00:03:22,35
and then some by the facilities were fairly skin was very good from a local bike and.

29
00:03:22,35 --> 00:03:30,05
He was the local baker who became very very wealthy. From having. A lot of the land around here.

30
00:03:30,05 --> 00:03:35,59
After he was a bakery sell the baker. Bakery and they became a real estate agent cleaned up. And then moved.

31
00:03:35,59 --> 00:03:44,51
Thank you very much kelly. Oh yeah yeah. Well.

32
00:03:44,51 --> 00:03:54,24
We don't know that it was really i think it's like it's hard for me to see that he went to the bakery on here

33
00:03:54,24 --> 00:03:58,86
and baker. Only lived here and so during the increased festival the people from the female foundry.

34
00:03:58,86 --> 00:04:02,17
Gave him a recipe for life which became their careers.

35
00:04:02,17 --> 00:04:10,01
And he liked that and sold it all around the area each time the bakery has been sold. That recipe is part of the deal.

36
00:04:10,01 --> 00:04:15,92
I think they change it every time and change hands that doesn't really resent. Anything like the night.

37
00:04:16,14 --> 00:04:37,77
But it was all made me go you got me. Organic grains and it was very tasty. As it was pretty primitive.

38
00:04:37,77 --> 00:04:47,56
Yeah it was very primitive and closing down at pisa and ensuing the best you could do is for shelter goddess. Here.

39
00:04:47,56 --> 00:04:53,97
I lived in a cabin else that had on one side the front of it was just a garden and.

40
00:04:53,97 --> 00:05:02,37
We had holidays and a big cast on tap outside. No more in the actual house.

41
00:05:02,37 --> 00:05:08,95
And it would start if it was totally an enclosed so it not. In the winter was very cold and.

42
00:05:08,95 --> 00:05:14,66
That was where my second child was born and we lived there for a couple of years before we moved to another community.

43
00:05:14,66 --> 00:05:21,93
And i was not impressed. And was a banshee i think that's a fairly have to scription. Chuck wobblies regularly.

44
00:05:22,14 --> 00:05:28,99
Well the plates. Tell him i don't want to live like this is not what i was cut out for at all.

45
00:05:28,99 --> 00:05:33,71
Having children it wasn't as difficult for me. And i quite enjoyed that.

46
00:05:33,71 --> 00:05:39,78
I mean it's like just continuing the playhouse aspect of my childhood home

47
00:05:39,78 --> 00:05:43,77
and being in north queensland to have a very different climate

48
00:05:43,77 --> 00:05:55,9
and ways to make these amazing ways to call them plastic palaces. With a staple gun builders plastic trays on his age.

49
00:05:55,9 --> 00:06:01,11
In queensland. So that was different when we were here during the festival.

50
00:06:01,11 --> 00:06:07,08
It was often very cold in the only place you could buy it was in the kraken hits the back of bands out the back of the

51
00:06:07,08 --> 00:06:15,67
right. Things like tropical also. Her problem.

52
00:06:15,67 --> 00:06:21,02
A lot of people used to get really really bad tropicals is that basically that was because hygiene was difficult

53
00:06:21,02 --> 00:06:29,71
and change a change of lifestyle tends to bring things in and also the paspalum when it cedes.

54
00:06:29,71 --> 00:06:33,5
I don't know why that is such a sticky standing stuff and it gets stuck to skin

55
00:06:33,5 --> 00:06:38,66
and often if there was a little cattle graze there. And up with a tropical sun and you would say.

56
00:06:38,66 --> 00:06:44,73
And i think partly it was diet as well people maybe going from being made to make purely vegetarian

57
00:06:44,73 --> 00:06:50,04
and not getting the right protein and. Yeah. And often not enough food.

58
00:06:50,04 --> 00:06:51,92
Little and good food

59
00:06:51,92 --> 00:07:04,32
and one of my dear friends was pregnant at the time to this weight on her shoe i think it was six weeks before the

60
00:07:04,32 --> 00:07:10,42
births used to get twenty five dollars a fortnight. And i was a smoker i'm quite a heavy smoker and.

61
00:07:11,14 --> 00:07:13,88
She stood by me a packet of drama out of that money.

62
00:07:13,88 --> 00:07:22,92
Every week every fortnight if she could it wasn't every fortnight actually. And we would go to listen to the you.

63
00:07:23,5 --> 00:07:32,27
I the u.p.i. Rooms. Which was like country women's association food. And we'd have. Corned beef and.

64
00:07:32,27 --> 00:07:35,14
You know what source and.

65
00:07:35,14 --> 00:07:49,38
And putting it was a real civil rights and to see to the table you know with a cloth an offer for the big tree and.

66
00:07:49,38 --> 00:07:53,26
Yeah the single women around here that run pensions for a very popular.

67
00:07:53,26 --> 00:08:00,08
Thing that would be a whole household centered around this not a single parent should have to tell stories of that

68
00:08:00,08 --> 00:08:05,72
other tangible. Did you stay because that you couldn't get social security but there was no.

69
00:08:05,72 --> 00:08:25,25
You know the single mothers would get. I think it was the forth community. That i lived.

70
00:08:25,25 --> 00:08:29,84
Living on a community where there's so many different ways that it can be done. Robert.

71
00:08:29,84 --> 00:08:34,8
I would say one of the most successful ones because the land was already owned by someone.

72
00:08:34,8 --> 00:08:40,03
There was no necessity to just take any camera. To who had money to buy a share.

73
00:08:40,03 --> 00:08:44,26
So we managed to step aside very slowly with.

74
00:08:44,26 --> 00:08:50,65
Extended family often brothers and sisters brothers and brothers mothers and children. So it's friends and friends.

75
00:08:50,65 --> 00:08:59,8
Yeah. You had to sort of. You have to really. And it works. Because we was real strong communication between everybody.

76
00:09:01,33 --> 00:09:13,73
A big extended family. Was from the normal entrepreneurial in the entrepreneurial.

77
00:09:13,73 --> 00:09:19,09
I mean places like which people that live a ton of them i imagine has its ups and downs.

78
00:09:19,43 --> 00:09:23,21
Because you don't get to choose your neighbors but once again tangibles very established

79
00:09:23,21 --> 00:09:26,17
and a lot of those people have known each other for a really really time.

80
00:09:26,17 --> 00:09:34,3
So there's a very strong contingent of old friends that i would say counterbalances the adverse.

81
00:09:34,3 --> 00:09:37,06
Things that happen when you don't have any choice about who you live with.

82
00:09:37,06 --> 00:09:39,12
And i don't think westerns are very good at that.

83
00:09:39,12 --> 00:09:43,78
And i think we're very basic i think we're communal animals we're very territorial and.

84
00:09:43,78 --> 00:09:47,63
So i don't really really feel though i think. Feel economically.

85
00:09:47,63 --> 00:09:55,21
Communities work i don't think in the in the real sense. People tend to isolate themselves and pushing off.

86
00:09:55,21 --> 00:10:04,13
This is mine and. You know if you stop in my vegie patch over here but it's no natural.

87
00:10:04,13 --> 00:10:12,05
It's not that sort of training really. If you don't you know you know you're occasionally is really good.

88
00:10:12,05 --> 00:10:18,31
And communicate. And the indians do it so much better.

89
00:10:18,31 --> 00:10:31,26
Yes better human a man living in close proximity with one another because a lot of the communities they stays out run

90
00:10:31,26 --> 00:10:32,9
in the sense of.

91
00:10:32,9 --> 00:10:36,66
An equal share like i mean people even these days have their own title

92
00:10:36,66 --> 00:10:43,23
and they have a portion of land that is theirs that they can put a fence around if they want to so really they're not

93
00:10:43,23 --> 00:10:53,67
all. Communities some of them are fine subdivisions cost. Rule accommodation for people so. In one sense they're vital.

94
00:10:53,67 --> 00:11:02,04
I don't put them down a tall. Though i wouldn't choose to live like that so.

95
00:11:02,04 --> 00:11:10,96
Because it's come full circle other people's needs to be able to resell. Yeah economically.

96
00:11:10,96 --> 00:11:23,62
Because it is difficult on our community we cannot sell it and we don't you know. Constitution.

97
00:11:23,62 --> 00:11:26,74
It's the company that owns everything.

98
00:11:26,74 --> 00:11:33,03
And so we have that's us to sell it so we have to be sure that our relationships are very good if you want to go

99
00:11:33,03 --> 00:11:39,14
somewhere. You don't go. Living in a screaming hate. You actually leave. Fairly i mean really and.

100
00:11:39,14 --> 00:11:43,54
You have other things that you have to do so you do.

101
00:11:43,54 --> 00:11:46,84
Community organizers who they want to live in your house and that person reimburses you

102
00:11:46,84 --> 00:11:48,99
but your shares are totally nonrefundable

103
00:11:48,99 --> 00:11:55,19
and that's the deal with all of us agreed to that because their shares are incredibly reasonably priced in his own in a

104
00:11:55,19 --> 00:12:05,38
small number of them. Dress. Very much indeed. But we built on trust because we didn't have any tenure told.

105
00:12:05,38 --> 00:12:12,19
In the beginning when we built there. And the woman on the land is one a very extraordinary human being so.

106
00:12:12,19 --> 00:12:24,7
We trusted her. And she trusted. Yes and it's worked really well. But that's just like you really feel like that.

107
00:12:24,7 --> 00:12:39,56
Changes here. My god my god. We don't really need to discuss. The drug problem. Everybody else.

108
00:12:39,56 --> 00:12:51,11
You know that's it said. Changes. The town. Ease. Like we've noticed in the last two years particularly that.

109
00:12:51,11 --> 00:12:56,93
Things are going here it is expanding. I mean to the point where we don't have parking. Anymore.

110
00:12:56,93 --> 00:13:02,41
In the street it's a battle to even. You know.

111
00:13:02,41 --> 00:13:15,63
There's lots of new businesses that have opened and they seem to be sustaining themselves out. Well.

112
00:13:15,63 --> 00:13:21,96
And we are accused of having become more straight. I think and. Whatever that means.

113
00:13:21,96 --> 00:13:30,81
I think that there are many more people who were originally a craze people that have decided to make a livelihood.

114
00:13:30,81 --> 00:13:35,07
But most of those people that i know make it out of something they really enjoy doing.

115
00:13:35,07 --> 00:13:40,55
So i don't necessarily see that as yeah i see it and also i think their value system. They have kept it.

116
00:13:40,55 --> 00:13:48,94
Why back there we tend to throw a few babies that with a head to go and sort of start to sleep bring them back

117
00:13:48,94 --> 00:13:58,86
and say sorry yes you were right mom and dad. Society story behind this. But in the long term.

118
00:13:58,86 --> 00:14:03,47
We did throw a lot of bathwater out that was really good to get rid of.

119
00:14:03,47 --> 00:14:08,58
But we do have to survive you know we do have to leave and we have to face that.

120
00:14:08,58 --> 00:14:23,97
And look at society you think it's ok i would try and feed him. And. As much on the terms as possible.

121
00:14:23,97 --> 00:14:27,3
Was a bit possibly the aquarian ideas were the beginning of the green movement.

122
00:14:27,41 --> 00:14:27,8
I mean

123
00:14:27,8 --> 00:14:33,88
when i talked about in a sense that's the best thing it for a revolution i'm truly believe that the ecological movement.

124
00:14:33,88 --> 00:14:38,76
Is the revolution. I mean. There was no way that society was just going to collapse.

125
00:14:38,76 --> 00:14:44,65
But they an extraordinary amount of waste. That we produce as a race.

126
00:14:44,65 --> 00:14:49,68
If we didn't have the green movement where the heck would we be having me like the watchdog. Taken.

127
00:14:49,68 --> 00:14:56,17
Twenty years for it to get any momentum at all or any training years ago we were sitting down crying about it.

128
00:14:56,17 --> 00:15:02,68
Day in and and totally impotent and didn't know what to do but could see it and.

129
00:15:02,68 --> 00:15:09,24
People were talking about it in real terms back then. If you had these to hear it. And nothing was done and.

130
00:15:09,24 --> 00:15:17,5
Twenty years down the track. And that's why i sometimes catch myself thinking it's too late and crying and.

131
00:15:17,5 --> 00:15:25,16
I think it's really difficult. But it does seem to have a bit of a hold now. It's moving ahead.

132
00:15:25,16 --> 00:15:28,57
And people are becoming conscious of it.

133
00:15:28,57 --> 00:15:35,02
And we've done it again we've done that in a real fun with a friend who dresses up as an old lady who goes to

134
00:15:35,02 --> 00:15:38,39
supermarkets with born to shop bags and. Badges you know.

135
00:15:38,74 --> 00:15:45,33
And she just advise everyone superman what's the best things to ryan has a great time doing it goes off to all the

136
00:15:45,33 --> 00:15:55,46
markets and i'm celeste. She's the only steel shop at best. But i think also that. First protesters.

137
00:15:55,46 --> 00:16:02,59
Protests that we had a really mini area where they were that all money from a lot of. Subsequent movements and.

138
00:16:02,59 --> 00:16:09,42
At the time. There was the biggest uproar about the hippies telling the bloggers what to do. I mean we were.

139
00:16:09,42 --> 00:16:14,32
The confrontations that some of those the terrain one in particular i remember was. Horrible.

140
00:16:14,32 --> 00:16:17,35
I mean you know people being hold of trees and.

141
00:16:17,35 --> 00:16:21,98
It was not that really broke new ground and really dated and it has made a very big.

142
00:16:21,98 --> 00:16:25,22
It's made people more courageous about speaking up for what they believe in

143
00:16:25,22 --> 00:16:28,95
and chaining themselves to trees if they feel that that's necessary.

144
00:16:28,95 --> 00:16:33,83
So i do believe that the aquarius movement not just the aquarius festival but. That whole period in time.

145
00:16:35,2 --> 00:16:37,12
This was the beginning of that.

146
00:16:37,12 --> 00:16:50,13
Of any real changes that was like if you got a little bit on the rear

147
00:16:50,13 --> 00:16:59,74
and a funny one i carry out tell you about being in jail. I can see. This is the being in power. Now.

148
00:17:00,16 --> 00:17:12,87
But it was it was it was fun center. We had this outcome. God can have to tell always awful things.

149
00:17:12,87 --> 00:17:18,49
We have the so can old holden called luigi. Restrained in the time. That.

150
00:17:18,49 --> 00:17:21,89
Jim and i had bought from a friend of us called robbie in sydney.

151
00:17:21,89 --> 00:17:25,62
We're supposed to pay my hundred dollars we paid in twenty.

152
00:17:25,62 --> 00:17:30,45
Neither of us had a license and we left sydney are back to i am so we wouldn't have any traffic

153
00:17:30,45 --> 00:17:39,38
or time we got to hornsby. It would already last second gear. So we went up and we arrived at my parents' place.

154
00:17:39,38 --> 00:17:41,99
On route. To name and were coming to newman to work.

155
00:17:41,99 --> 00:17:53,23
A festival and provided all the questions about the legalities of the space that we had and. Then we came here.

156
00:17:53,23 --> 00:18:01,13
And we were at the story is about. I am driving down to the beach town past bonding with a chord progression hate.

157
00:18:01,13 --> 00:18:07,92
When we went there and there's a caravan park there anyway so we packed luigi there. And we went down to the basij and.

158
00:18:07,92 --> 00:18:13,55
The tide came in so we were able to swim around a couple of beaches. A-y. From the current.

159
00:18:14,63 --> 00:18:19,53
And as we come out of north queensland we've been running naked for a couple of years already off with the clothes

160
00:18:19,53 --> 00:18:21,73
and then we went for a good swim.

161
00:18:22,07 --> 00:18:26,85
And i must tell you joe was nearly nine months pregnant with jean king at this point in time.

162
00:18:26,85 --> 00:18:35,82
So she was for every being round and round these huge breasts is renowned for it. And her blue eyes.

163
00:18:35,82 --> 00:18:45,07
In case this got be close to a day focus from her beautiful blue eyes. Originally. Anyway so.

164
00:18:45,07 --> 00:18:52,33
We'd have a swim and jill and i was sitting on the beach and we could see a gardener and miss campbell fishing and.

165
00:18:52,33 --> 00:18:59,59
And he was he went past and he climbed up was like you got trial over the mountain and back around the cabin.

166
00:18:59,59 --> 00:19:05,88
And then there was nobody you know. And then looked up. And here are two people think sman.

167
00:19:05,88 --> 00:19:09,42
Coming well to maintain her place and coming down over the hill.

168
00:19:09,42 --> 00:19:15,06
So we sort of had a little discussion i want to do and thought of. We'll just stay put it's ok.

169
00:19:15,06 --> 00:19:23,13
Surely if i could handle. We're sitting down you know it's not much to say and. And jewels when seen having swim and.

170
00:19:23,13 --> 00:19:30,45
These men walked right up to us and we thought oh that's really insensitive you know now what. And i said.

171
00:19:30,45 --> 00:19:33,88
My place get your clothes on girlie. You know.

172
00:19:33,88 --> 00:19:38,77
And i'm certain to jewels come out of the water come out of the water

173
00:19:38,77 --> 00:19:46,78
and she's saying you know what was going are you know. Anyway so.

174
00:19:46,78 --> 00:19:51,17
Jill stood up to sort of get it close only just looked at this.

175
00:19:51,17 --> 00:19:55,97
Figure you know up until then they were just looking at mason come on girl you know i get your clothes.

176
00:19:55,97 --> 00:20:01,31
And i said are you pregnant and she said.

177
00:20:01,31 --> 00:20:05,38
Do you think watermelon being really cheeky to them

178
00:20:05,38 --> 00:20:09,95
but i would just sing them my school ludicrous thing which of course of course i mean.

179
00:20:09,95 --> 00:20:14,89
Apparently the fisherman had told the guy at the caravan park and the guy at the caravan. Heighted he peace.

180
00:20:14,89 --> 00:20:17,46
He rang the police thinking this is a good.

181
00:20:17,46 --> 00:20:25,95
You know this is a good one and said i had to walk like a nine kilometer or something over this track to get us anyway.

182
00:20:26,19 --> 00:20:34,13
So i knew i had by this time jules this realize that something's going on so i called and said come and get a close on.

183
00:20:34,13 --> 00:20:44,51
So we did it in a sort of a fashion and. We had to follow them one walked in front and behind and off we went and.

184
00:20:44,51 --> 00:20:51,34
Trying to communicate with each other because we didn't want i didn't want to acknowledge that we had this bloody can't.

185
00:20:51,34 --> 00:20:57,57
Because none of us have that sense right and there's a little bit of something or other in the glove box plus all

186
00:20:57,57 --> 00:21:05,87
and i know sooner or later than. You know i just all asked if our whole life was in bloody luigi poor thing. So drunk.

187
00:21:05,87 --> 00:21:10,66
Clunking our car passed me just of my little wife and we went on

188
00:21:10,66 --> 00:21:16,97
and so they put us in the place come to us to the station. And they actually had to ring up to find out what.

189
00:21:16,97 --> 00:21:26,74
Charge us with. So i went for the criminal charge which was offensive behavior. And we were fingerprinted and searched.

190
00:21:26,74 --> 00:21:33,99
And i had to search out belongings and. I had a certain belonging that. Really i didn't like looking at.

191
00:21:33,99 --> 00:21:38,31
Now i told them they wouldn't. And i had no.

192
00:21:38,31 --> 00:21:40,42
Woman there so you know one of the place

193
00:21:40,42 --> 00:21:46,3
and had together twelve i mean it was just crazy they could have just say no we're not going to answer this call

194
00:21:46,3 --> 00:21:53,61
but they obviously wanted to make a stand and it was something that people were being offended by.

195
00:21:53,61 --> 00:21:54,86
At that point in time.

196
00:21:54,86 --> 00:22:00,4
Most of the people without clothes on no matter how far away you went from everybody it was just an issue.

197
00:22:01,66 --> 00:22:02,99
So we got locked up.

198
00:22:02,99 --> 00:22:10,94
But we still told them that you would be very upset if she was locked in a cell and might bring on her birth.

199
00:22:10,94 --> 00:22:17,93
So i didn't even dare and i looked at some just out. Exercise yard. So went like this not gone.

200
00:22:17,93 --> 00:22:23,66
Like songs with a funny thing about the winter that was really cute i learned that song and.

201
00:22:23,66 --> 00:22:31,01
I bought us some fish and chips because we were vegetarians and. Wholemeal bread fruit.

202
00:22:31,01 --> 00:22:37,27
And by then we rang graham and term. The aquarius foundation by old us.

203
00:22:37,27 --> 00:22:44,6
So later santa may while i can still around the bay. Didn't have a bible. Thank god.

204
00:22:44,6 --> 00:22:49,74
But we had to go to court you know that whole thing. And the whole of name been turned up at the court.

205
00:22:49,74 --> 00:22:57,34
Which of course didn't do any good for us in the morning but it's made it much worse. And the other thing was that.

206
00:22:57,34 --> 00:23:04,13
That morning we had to get to court so we had to steal it.

207
00:23:04,13 --> 00:23:08,32
So we stole his car and left a note on the footpath under a rock sign.

208
00:23:08,32 --> 00:23:13,45
But we just had to take your car to get out because so when we got back in his car the police called us up

209
00:23:13,45 --> 00:23:20,07
and said this coast guard i mean that was ok of course as soon as we found him

210
00:23:20,07 --> 00:23:27,09
and saved our see that we had to go to court and. It was like that you know. It's just it was a funny.

211
00:23:27,53 --> 00:23:36,81
I'm very interested you said. Oh yes. We were guilty.

212
00:23:36,81 --> 00:23:48,46
But i was yes i am and find us were all fined fifty dollars over ten days

213
00:23:48,46 --> 00:24:06,47
and nobody was going to do ten days so we were promised we would give him fifty dollars. Ok. I am just those of us.
