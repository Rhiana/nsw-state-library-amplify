1
00:00:15,71 --> 00:00:29,83
Ok so what is this and this is why. A lot of alleged. Lynage.

2
00:00:29,83 --> 00:00:54,06
You know like a chain saw him in case he said at last you need to see why i didn't come to the aquarius festival.

3
00:00:54,06 --> 00:01:01,87
I was working you saw him on i'm slimness. And i've lived here since. Permanently since seventy nine and.

4
00:01:01,87 --> 00:01:10,66
I heard about him. I guess there must have been a lot of advertising or something like that.

5
00:01:10,66 --> 00:01:17,99
Certainly people were talking about it. And i was working in funky. Vegetarian restaurant and.

6
00:01:17,99 --> 00:01:22,67
We closed down side paper would have the opportunity to come up for the festival

7
00:01:22,67 --> 00:01:27,3
and a mad man turned up with some pink rocks and.

8
00:01:27,3 --> 00:01:32,46
That was that there was no choice i had thank god he charged up because from sydney and.

9
00:01:32,46 --> 00:01:38,4
Camp and so on and i had a lot of mights from school and so on who were who were coming.

10
00:01:38,4 --> 00:01:47,38
Because i'd left school before i think and. I was you know not using drugs. Copious amounts they're all for the.

11
00:01:47,38 --> 00:01:53,2
The time that the restaurant was closed and. Then the restaurant reopened.

12
00:01:53,2 --> 00:01:56,61
So i got the backroom thing and i think it was the first.

13
00:01:56,61 --> 00:02:02,29
The first job that i'd ever had and the first consequences of my addiction.

14
00:02:02,29 --> 00:02:09,41
But everybody else aim to have a really good time at the festival and. I ended up coming up a few years later.

15
00:02:09,41 --> 00:02:19,94
I think god. My kid must have. About i. Months old and i came up traveling north and. And we started tumble.

16
00:02:19,94 --> 00:02:26,8
And i remember trying to buy milk in the morning. Because we'd run out of milk. And i had nothin myself.

17
00:02:26,8 --> 00:02:34,05
And i couldn't get anybody to say i'm not the woman who was in charge of the fucking cows wouldn't sell me an email

18
00:02:34,05 --> 00:02:38,03
because it was about seven o'clock in the morning and she had a shit to do.

19
00:02:38,03 --> 00:02:46,18
And i got so angry i was really pissed off and. I thought this is a really fall place.

20
00:02:46,18 --> 00:02:52,68
And come back for about four years and then i met. Back up and down. But yeah.

21
00:02:53,02 --> 00:03:00,31
My sort of experiences with sort of negative. In one way or another either not coming here or.

22
00:03:00,31 --> 00:03:10,61
Getting pissed off with a lack of couse. Wasn't. Mohnish i'm sobbing.

23
00:03:10,61 --> 00:03:19,71
So i'm cast some of the man like came up while i was. I came up to the fistula when the original.

24
00:03:19,71 --> 00:03:28,42
Aquarius festival was a student at monash university at the time studying economics and politics.

25
00:03:29,49 --> 00:03:30,49
I was really studying

26
00:03:30,49 --> 00:03:38,93
when aleutian that's the miners know i'm going to moan i shall go away i was there was a high dive the mt the a.t.v.

27
00:03:38,93 --> 00:03:47,6
It name and you can see. Depiction. Movements and. The five years of that thought seem to be coming from ornish.

28
00:03:47,6 --> 00:03:57,45
Going to monash and. I hung in there for a couple of years and. When that came to an end.

29
00:03:57,45 --> 00:04:05,52
That came to an end was at university the queerest fist of all our way into my figure by sidwell figured this was the

30
00:04:05,52 --> 00:04:15,93
next direction of the revolutionaries. It was. Was headed into the hills. My. Today maker it was a bit dicey.

31
00:04:15,93 --> 00:04:24,94
My drug consumption was sort of a sky thing off. Is the price for many this is the price health revolution.

32
00:04:25,94 --> 00:04:34,5
And for the good laws and. I came up. Went to the festival. Went back to melbourne.

33
00:04:37,54 --> 00:04:46,36
As well my staff and girlfriend and. And her up to this area headed up to this area and.

34
00:04:46,36 --> 00:04:52,34
Moved in and basically i've been biased in this area of the scenes where you live for our border.

35
00:04:52,34 --> 00:04:55,27
A share of the tunnel.

36
00:04:55,27 --> 00:05:15,29
Lived there for a while or moved around it lived in nice been biased in a series of the scenes and.

37
00:05:15,29 --> 00:05:22,46
It's hard to miss i mean i think if you're an addict manifest drugs. Like i mean a few.

38
00:05:23,05 --> 00:05:31,09
And you have to do it and that's just reality. And so i mean i just did anything that i need to do.

39
00:05:31,09 --> 00:05:34,21
To get drugs and a man in the alley dies.

40
00:05:35,09 --> 00:05:42,35
It wasn't a diet a necessity i didn't have to have drugs on adani by so i could just you know occasionally.

41
00:05:42,35 --> 00:05:50,45
Just this weekend use or you know. Be nice but you know it's more like been issues and.

42
00:05:50,45 --> 00:05:59,15
In latter gys fortunate street culture and grown up enough so that one could arrest signed by susan.

43
00:05:59,15 --> 00:06:03,4
And i could quit you know. So it wasn't. I mean once. That it happened it was.

44
00:06:03,4 --> 00:06:13,12
It was a really easy thing to survive in terms of your addiction. Prior to that i surprised everybody get more rest.

45
00:06:13,19 --> 00:06:21,45
You play or you go off and you get money. Yeah. One of them or.

46
00:06:21,45 --> 00:06:30,47
One of the reasons i came out he was to get a wife from from. Narcotics as well as hard drugs.

47
00:06:30,47 --> 00:06:40,8
And quite a few of my friends and a lot in the hills the sign raising where's their ideology quieted. Psychedelics is.

48
00:06:42,53 --> 00:06:50,88
As cool and acceptable one part of part of the fight against the established while we did pretty early in the police.

49
00:06:50,88 --> 00:07:01,62
To saved narcotics and alcohol and bobby to it's and pills as pretty much. Pool. Uncool as as as methods.

50
00:07:01,62 --> 00:07:04,82
For the establishment. To control people.

51
00:07:04,82 --> 00:07:13,9
And in the eyes died we were pretty one i mean we we knew about the say i smiling heroin out of their name

52
00:07:13,9 --> 00:07:22,2
and we knew all that we knew all the connections and it was pretty to do. And what we're is.

53
00:07:22,2 --> 00:07:29,92
We enjoyed the psychedelics we we didn't really feel comfortable with. Using. Using that colleagues and we did.

54
00:07:30,88 --> 00:07:37,37
But once again that was a different contradiction there what that there wasn't with. The psychedelics and.

55
00:07:37,95 --> 00:07:42,35
Yeah that was one of the reasons. On the doc he was to get a wife and that whole saying.

56
00:07:42,35 --> 00:07:48,26
High street smart decision is an element of that time i want to actually hit on that it was harder

57
00:07:48,26 --> 00:07:53,13
and harder to get the mind expanding drugs in melbourne and more of the hard drugs were coming in

58
00:07:53,13 --> 00:08:04,51
and then we looked upon that is a means of pression a means of of wakening.

59
00:08:04,51 --> 00:08:09,52
The sort of revelation i made and we felt was was happening in that time and.

60
00:08:09,52 --> 00:08:19,77
I think i think it's probably going to be part of the. You know. Colleagues and high standards. History.

61
00:08:19,77 --> 00:08:31,5
Drugs have picked a gentleman to saudi which are most likely to be trying to chime in a lot of people here get a life

62
00:08:31,5 --> 00:08:53,95
from out here. Well a lot of it was that for me personally it's political after all the guy done.

63
00:08:53,95 --> 00:09:04,29
Well for me it was basically trying to build. Become separate to become super economically politically socially.

64
00:09:04,29 --> 00:09:13,18
To be independent. To not be dependent on mindstream society around. From it everything from a bicycle.

65
00:09:13,18 --> 00:09:24,69
Material necessities to add to our cultural to our cultural consumption. Was to build an alternative system. I think.

66
00:09:24,69 --> 00:09:28,6
Where we didn't really want him to say. I didn't perceive.

67
00:09:28,6 --> 00:09:35,00
Any real likelihood of any violent revolution ever happening in a stride but i really thought that we could perhaps.

68
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:43,03
Build an alternative society. Which had a lot of guys that use that.

69
00:09:43,03 --> 00:09:48,04
That i that i thought mainstream society lacked and side by sickly.

70
00:09:48,04 --> 00:09:56,27
What we were about was trying to build a different system. In different schools. Different economy.

71
00:09:57,06 --> 00:10:05,25
You know not plugged into the grid. And i'm not eating the sign food. I mean self-sufficient. And independent from an.

72
00:10:12,95 --> 00:10:28,34
Oh. Again i think. Yeah. I think i think grass. Grass in particular was it was a great help for. A lot of table.

73
00:10:28,34 --> 00:10:38,36
Model play with for a lot of people to get started up here. I mean people didn't have any money. There was no work.

74
00:10:38,36 --> 00:10:47,76
There was no way to get a regular income people would go away and get a bit of a grubstake to get started. After that.

75
00:10:47,76 --> 00:10:55,00
But then again i could do to supplement their income with social security or seasonal work and.

76
00:10:55,00 --> 00:10:57,31
The extra few dollars that.

77
00:10:57,31 --> 00:11:04,07
Little bit of grass boardin to the families was enough to get the cut the car reduced the engine.

78
00:11:04,07 --> 00:11:11,9
The engine rebuild all the team for the roof. And i think the court a few people was a pretty integral part.

79
00:11:11,9 --> 00:11:14,41
And it set that set.

80
00:11:14,41 --> 00:11:22,88
Audiological it set pretty well with table because it was part once again of building a colony outside the mine strain.

81
00:11:40,88 --> 00:11:46,01
I don't believe that. You know. Distinctions become involved or that.

82
00:11:46,01 --> 00:11:49,58
You know any group large quantities of dots

83
00:11:49,58 --> 00:11:55,55
and i don't think there was ever anything not the grass castle syndrome that psi happening with.

84
00:11:55,55 --> 00:12:01,65
Because i think the ideology of the people engaged in the action.

85
00:12:01,65 --> 00:12:09,41
The results in that you know if you want to fucking huge castles anyway. You know.

86
00:12:09,41 --> 00:12:14,78
You want to just some nasty little house in the forest. I wanted good gardens.

87
00:12:14,78 --> 00:12:22,54
Not be one of my next novel you want to have you know take video or anything like that everybody had a notion of.

88
00:12:22,54 --> 00:12:32,53
You know leading a pretty sort of. Soundly principled life by stone. Like a nomics and. Son.

89
00:12:32,53 --> 00:12:38,51
I mean it's somebody did manage to flu. To grow are like you know a few pounds of dog.

90
00:12:38,51 --> 00:12:43,12
I mean nobody knew what to do with it. I probably got half of the wires that night so they.

91
00:12:43,12 --> 00:12:48,52
I mean everybody smoked a lot of paper with sort of. I had apparently. You know i mean.

92
00:12:48,52 --> 00:12:54,75
Welcome it was at that thing exchange to like i don't know anybody that i can think of.

93
00:12:54,75 --> 00:13:00,49
Around here who who you know got heavy or grew a lot of dark

94
00:13:00,49 --> 00:13:06,57
or anything not that my paper model just built really nice houses. But even that. You know a lot.

95
00:13:06,57 --> 00:13:12,96
I did a lot of that themselves. And i'm out of employed and my to do some saw for. Whatever i don't.

96
00:13:12,96 --> 00:13:18,45
You know nobody ever sat around up here. In their patches. With ruffles or.

97
00:13:18,45 --> 00:13:21,24
You know rabbit traps or anything like that it was.

98
00:13:21,24 --> 00:13:25,92
And i mean i think that sort of language is being all that sort of discourse has been engaged in

99
00:13:25,92 --> 00:13:32,23
but i don't believe it i just think that that paper would like to imagine that sort of thing happening up in the hills

100
00:13:32,23 --> 00:13:35,31
but it's certainly not a mark spear in sonoma and.

101
00:13:35,31 --> 00:13:40,75
You know a lot of people growing dark for a lot of years and it just say. The people who were talked about as.

102
00:13:40,75 --> 00:13:45,24
You know inverted commas. Grows are just people living in shacks.

103
00:13:46,09 --> 00:13:57,27
Maybe sit on a pan of dark free here and that's this because the horror. Never perceived as a big growth industry.

104
00:13:57,27 --> 00:13:58,98
Other than you know. A sustainable.

105
00:13:58,98 --> 00:14:08,31
Kind of trip for people to just live on really simply sitting on the savanna which is talk to me in a process that's

106
00:14:08,31 --> 00:14:19,75
for sure. I mean just the home. Night sure of the land up here and the amount of people names that basically.

107
00:14:19,75 --> 00:14:27,46
People can get a wife would lodge with playing time the night of the laying and the amount of people around here and.

108
00:14:27,46 --> 00:14:36,84
People can't get a wyoming. People don't grow crops some in the bag. Like residents have a strong family.

109
00:14:36,84 --> 00:14:45,29
I mean that's. I mean large quantities of news been busted up here on the. Communion dollar drug bust.

110
00:14:45,29 --> 00:14:50,15
Like somebody who's got four tries it's not in something say things like two inches high

111
00:14:50,15 --> 00:14:56,27
and that i never knew that it is a full grown plant. There's never been the plantations that their family.

112
00:14:56,27 --> 00:14:59,81
You know other areas where there's never been the organization i mean.

113
00:14:59,81 --> 00:15:03,74
The people up here all bunch manik is something real in there.

114
00:15:03,74 --> 00:15:09,28
That anything we haven't managed to organize with the defense of the forests and even that was very ad hoc

115
00:15:09,28 --> 00:15:10,97
and of this really had hawken.

116
00:15:10,97 --> 00:15:17,21
And that's what made it work sure you know like we were able to do that so well because everybody could just run around

117
00:15:17,21 --> 00:15:20,16
in the forest and be chrisy by sickly.

118
00:15:20,16 --> 00:15:24,81
I mean there was never that a courtly i sort of crummy not them about any sort of.

119
00:15:24,81 --> 00:15:34,14
Saw him you ever got out he was totally disorganized. You know in a really small on a really small sky.

120
00:15:34,14 --> 00:15:41,29
I mean isn't that the kind of crime that occurs in time like this it would be many.

121
00:15:41,29 --> 00:15:44,5
There are not people running around stealing people's video.

122
00:15:44,5 --> 00:15:45,13
Anything like that

123
00:15:45,13 --> 00:15:51,65
and i mean you could probably argue that because this is a bit of a dive economy you know people can sign terms of

124
00:15:51,65 --> 00:15:56,94
addiction support their habits here and i don't need to sort of go around.

125
00:15:56,94 --> 00:16:13,12
Ripping off people's property or anything like that. It doesn't happen the drug problem is.

126
00:16:13,6 --> 00:16:18,6
Well i guess that's the drug problem as i say that i said i think that the drug problem is you know.

127
00:16:18,6 --> 00:16:29,17
A few sort of really skinny looking ferals and that's. I think people say the drug problem.

128
00:16:29,17 --> 00:16:34,41
As very singular like it's just you know a few skinny girls hanging around outside the right about katherine that's a

129
00:16:34,41 --> 00:16:41,75
really horrific drug problem whereas in fact nobody's being burgled. You know nobody's videos of thing tike and.

130
00:16:41,75 --> 00:16:49,04
It's just that. We have one strange. Collins. With a couple of. Off shoots and.

131
00:16:49,04 --> 00:16:55,27
People sit on the street outside the rhino or outside the museum or outside the tomato sauce.

132
00:16:55,27 --> 00:17:03,46
And sometimes they pissed and sometimes they're on the nod and are not science a pretty much. But it's.

133
00:17:03,46 --> 00:17:08,44
It's a very small time drug problem it's. It's not anything particularly serious and often.

134
00:17:08,44 --> 00:17:12,81
You know i think that the people. Even on the not of peace they're just sitting there looking minutes.

135
00:17:12,81 --> 00:17:15,77
And that will probably give the kids a lot of pleasure to sort of.

136
00:17:15,77 --> 00:17:17,17
Be that many saying

137
00:17:17,17 --> 00:17:22,77
and i know it must be really hard to be a little light in the shopping trolley walking down the street

138
00:17:22,77 --> 00:17:25,85
and having to walk through that little bottleneck in front of the right.

139
00:17:25,85 --> 00:17:31,62
And i've actually recently suggested that we extend the street skype so that.

140
00:17:31,62 --> 00:17:35,26
There's several bottlenecks there rather than just the one and that way people can move.

141
00:17:35,26 --> 00:17:39,98
At random through it and must be really scary because i don't know.

142
00:17:39,98 --> 00:17:43,92
You know this kid's just tonight a new year old and he's just a good.

143
00:17:43,92 --> 00:17:52,4
Whatever you know i just see him as a as a dirty threatening. And it must be really hard. And they're not they're not.

144
00:17:52,4 --> 00:18:01,04
It's not king's cross. You know. And also i think the dye problem is is this cat fries used to describe.

145
00:18:01,04 --> 00:18:11,12
Run a white kids. Homelessness poverty. Sauk patients who are being kicked out of half why hasn't got nowhere to go.

146
00:18:11,75 --> 00:18:16,1
It's people we don't like it's. Drug problem is a drug problem. The other.

147
00:18:16,1 --> 00:18:22,35
That is the drug problem marginalized and who haven't got any way to go and that we don't want here in our nice town.

148
00:18:22,35 --> 00:18:29,75
We want. Town to be a fairly senate treetop. Plies. And i wrecked the landscape architecture.

149
00:18:29,75 --> 00:18:36,11
Simply wouldn't say in terms of economics over poverty and homelessness i said in terms of the drug problem.

150
00:18:36,11 --> 00:18:39,02
You know whereas a lot of those people haven't got a drug problem

151
00:18:39,02 --> 00:18:44,28
and i just sitting there because they've got nowhere else to bloody sit and nowhere else to go and they've got.

152
00:18:44,28 --> 00:18:47,66
I mean i don't have much in their lives. From our perspective.

153
00:18:47,66 --> 00:18:52,72
But you know like you don't have to have much in your life when you're writing you just want to hang out

154
00:18:52,72 --> 00:18:53,72
and hang around

155
00:18:53,72 --> 00:19:00,44
and people say oh we'll say all latin rather than looking at the real issue is the fundamental issue is because of all

156
00:19:00,44 --> 00:19:07,7
the media heart. Because of. Because of. You know the issue is that the best interests.

157
00:19:07,7 --> 00:19:10,25
The vested interests are pushing in this town.

158
00:19:10,25 --> 00:19:15,97
Always these complex social issues that are occurring everywhere out of the whole west and east

159
00:19:15,97 --> 00:19:22,74
and well there is not just women. Has come under that the tardy problem of. The toddy hitting of the drug problem.

160
00:19:23,44 --> 00:19:29,13
And i mean i think that's the hardest thing because people do. Do say niman as separate.

161
00:19:29,13 --> 00:19:35,86
As a different place and that we shouldn't have these sort of problems here we should have some kind of. Idyllic.

162
00:19:35,86 --> 00:19:39,66
Kind of recently and model of sucking.

163
00:19:39,66 --> 00:19:46,79
Pastoral larf you know and it's ridiculous like we have this sign kind of problems that. Every you know.

164
00:19:47,8 --> 00:19:52,86
Western capitalist nation has and i mean we're just we're just a microcosm of the kind of problems.

165
00:19:52,86 --> 00:19:55,79
That other places have and i mean washroom.

166
00:19:55,79 --> 00:20:01,79
Human being any different when that something that really irritates me actually. One of our private. Pit heights.

167
00:20:01,79 --> 00:20:10,8
Is that people have this notion that. Newman. Is this fucking wonderful place and should be this sort of dream.

168
00:20:10,8 --> 00:20:16,11
And that we're not we're just really ordinary people and. And the problems that we have a ordinary problems lot.

169
00:20:16,11 --> 00:20:22,64
You know things like alcoholism and drug addiction and i have been everywhere the happening on a cholera

170
00:20:22,64 --> 00:20:24,93
and the happening column straight and.

171
00:20:25,59 --> 00:20:29,82
That's just the way it is and i mean i think there are really positive things that we can do about it.

172
00:20:29,82 --> 00:20:33,22
You know such as you know halfway houses and.

173
00:20:33,22 --> 00:20:39,06
Drug education i think it's really important to have drug education for tonight and.

174
00:20:39,06 --> 00:20:46,31
You know workshops for them and i think it's important to have a lot of other things for our kids were a society here.

175
00:20:46,31 --> 00:20:52,58
That is. Is going to have to buy. You know a lot of markets i chain. Hasten the although i can't agree.

176
00:20:52,58 --> 00:20:57,99
My brother's girlfriend's. Twenty two. She's one of the first set of kids that went through and.

177
00:20:57,99 --> 00:21:02,08
More and more like around the fourteen year old age group where my nephew.

178
00:21:02,08 --> 00:21:08,3
We have a lot of a lot of kids coming up and i think that we need to sort of provide facilities for them.

179
00:21:08,3 --> 00:21:10,95
Not just you know. In regard to sort of.

180
00:21:10,95 --> 00:21:15,12
Drug and alcohol education or anything like that but i mean like we've got the youth club

181
00:21:15,12 --> 00:21:22,00
and that needs funding i mean kids. In any country town. Night a lot of things to do and. Again. You know.

182
00:21:22,00 --> 00:21:22,75
Different in that and.

183
00:21:22,75 --> 00:21:28,62
Perhaps we can address things in a more creative mannah than other country townsmen we can give them better things this

184
00:21:28,62 --> 00:21:33,69
new titles you know. But it's certainly something we're going to have to look at.

185
00:21:33,69 --> 00:21:40,41
And i don't think you know that our kids are going to be any different must be kids are going to win lee.

186
00:21:40,41 --> 00:21:45,93
Most of our kids want to get a gun and want to you know live in the cities and. Do the things that city kids do.

187
00:21:45,93 --> 00:22:01,27
My sickly. So. Yeah i think that the nimbin miss is one that is carried in the hearts of many australians.

188
00:22:01,27 --> 00:22:04,97
The post seventy's generation i mean. The call went out.

189
00:22:04,97 --> 00:22:13,12
Didn't if we called it that those of us who'd grown up in the sixty's and.

190
00:22:13,32 --> 00:22:18,85
And many answered that call you know people kind of in common i think ryan

191
00:22:18,85 --> 00:22:22,59
and joined do a pretty good job of public publicize and.

192
00:22:22,59 --> 00:22:29,57
I mean armistead unfortunately but that was my choice probably. And i mean people kind. And.

193
00:22:29,57 --> 00:22:31,75
And i think people had a fucking good party.

194
00:22:31,75 --> 00:22:37,2
They had a great party and that's probably all it was and i don't think that this is this.

195
00:22:37,2 --> 00:22:44,6
Self-importance that takes place in the you know in people's minds with i well i have to sort of build up they used to

196
00:22:44,6 --> 00:22:52,74
mike. Maining for something like that and and particularly who left. Does he just kind of the party.

197
00:22:53,41 --> 00:22:59,82
I went to why and i wanted to say that i took place in something meaningful for once in their damn lives and.

198
00:22:59,82 --> 00:23:06,63
And so you know this myth about newman grew up as. As you know the repository of file dreams or not you know and.

199
00:23:06,63 --> 00:23:11,72
I mean i think it's really difficult for those of us who actually live here because people expect us to sort of the

200
00:23:11,72 --> 00:23:21,46
hiving. In a certain why. You know to be some kind of. You know. Visionary society. To live out.

201
00:23:21,46 --> 00:23:23,12
Does the ideals of the seventy's

202
00:23:23,12 --> 00:23:28,42
and i mean basically it's the noughties i don't i don't see why i should have to live that anybody's vision.

203
00:23:28,42 --> 00:23:32,92
Other than my own and you know my own vision news is you know i feel a small tomine personal

204
00:23:32,92 --> 00:23:36,84
and i want living here it's a great place to live. But also. I don't see it in any.

205
00:23:37,28 --> 00:23:44,68
In any novel terms and i don't say it in any particular idealistic terms and i do think that.

206
00:23:44,68 --> 00:23:50,34
I do think that the personal is political and that you know you live out your politics in your logs and.

207
00:23:50,34 --> 00:23:53,45
You can only do that in a really really small why in effect.

208
00:23:54,48 --> 00:24:00,97
Those that are really close to you and i don't know i mean i think something really weird went on in him

209
00:24:00,97 --> 00:24:08,83
and people who were probably really good at publicist

210
00:24:08,83 --> 00:24:13,12
and i mean we've all got sort of fairly public skills you know people who sort of were trying to.

211
00:24:13,3 --> 00:24:18,09
In the seventy's and i guess we've got the numbers.

212
00:24:19,65 --> 00:24:26,99
I think that the paper kind of did develop a myth about what newman was and.

213
00:24:26,99 --> 00:24:35,77
And its price and i think that it occupies a large amount. Then than it could possibly ever condon's.

214
00:24:35,77 --> 00:24:42,59
I think that it looms large in people's minds. Really unnecessarily you know like it's just a place where people live.

215
00:24:42,59 --> 00:24:47,38
It's a country town. And i mean most of us a fairly well educated who lives here.

216
00:24:47,38 --> 00:24:53,4
And there was you know a real element of people who were very broad and very middle class.

217
00:24:53,4 --> 00:24:59,61
Lives and so we probably got high in terms of brines a top heavy town. But you know that.

218
00:24:59,61 --> 00:25:03,15
That's about it i don't think there's anything else going on here. Other than.

219
00:25:03,15 --> 00:25:08,94
You know a few brought people sitting around having fun and living their lives and. There's still that focus.

220
00:25:09,47 --> 00:25:14,98
I guess it's you know it's good for publishers it was good for the pay are in the seventy's when it happened in that.

221
00:25:14,98 --> 00:25:21,07
You know there were a few nike tits and bottoms around and. You know we're still burying asked so.

222
00:25:21,07 --> 00:25:35,25
To the national sarky a very high angle that people have to fucking listen to people about me when it's a story

223
00:25:35,25 --> 00:25:39,23
but i think it's part of the human myth because basically a lot of people come here.

224
00:25:39,23 --> 00:25:43,51
They've taken in the myth to heart and i come here would always expect tyson's.

225
00:25:43,51 --> 00:25:48,67
About what i expected to them when it doesn't live up to their.

226
00:25:48,67 --> 00:25:56,77
Their expectations to their dreams or their allusions by a blind man than by blind liminal by blind.

227
00:25:56,77 --> 00:26:04,37
Driving a sideline or this whole thing that happens with people you know cycles for example move to the country

228
00:26:04,37 --> 00:26:11,09
and think again the going to have this you know reselling model for a start they have to spend twenty four hours a day

229
00:26:11,09 --> 00:26:16,12
together their kids are at home. With them often. You know the six or the vision of life.

230
00:26:16,12 --> 00:26:23,54
Comes into play and then they last fall and. I split up. And then he's back to this. Having had a ghastly tell on and.

231
00:26:23,54 --> 00:26:32,47
And again that line. What he thought. I mean we've lived here with ideals and i was on deals of chinese domain.

232
00:26:32,47 --> 00:26:37,23
We came here with a lot of those original ideals and we have had to put those ideals in the practice

233
00:26:37,23 --> 00:26:44,84
and what we've come up with a man twenty years down the line is. As a result of putting was.

234
00:26:44,84 --> 00:26:51,45
Ideals into practice and they've chinese considerably and reality and. The reality of living here.

235
00:26:51,45 --> 00:26:59,4
The reality of the chinese economic times and social tang's and growing alder and children. We don't use tobacco lives.

236
00:26:59,4 --> 00:27:06,00
Toilet paper anymore than the chinese i mean you know we kind he we had these ideals originally as well

237
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:12,57
and i mean we just adapted to reality and. I'm in love guys on the menu just gotta live a normal life and.

238
00:27:12,57 --> 00:27:17,85
I mean you can do that. You know with the praxis of china and yeah.

239
00:27:17,85 --> 00:27:22,64
And just because just because the why we live these guys doesn't.

240
00:27:22,64 --> 00:27:30,87
Doesn't come in saw it with a lot of people's sort of seventy's allusions about what alternative law should be and.

241
00:27:30,87 --> 00:27:39,04
Because i say. You know. Feral savages and not noble savages on a sunday morning.

242
00:27:39,04 --> 00:27:44,79
By then by then i think that the whole dream is filed and the whole thing is a disaster

243
00:27:44,79 --> 00:27:50,47
but really it's just it's just china's not think of the fact that it's gone on and has adapted

244
00:27:50,47 --> 00:27:56,86
and has adapted by simply prove that it's still a lot of unwell. And it's still growing. You know.

245
00:27:56,86 --> 00:28:05,11
It's that time to fashion because seventy specially in flowing locks is really what people are used to in their peril

246
00:28:05,11 --> 00:28:11,91
several. Comforts that people find that really confronting somebody the other day i got a lot of that some.

247
00:28:11,91 --> 00:28:19,93
Some go had a. In this it was just like. I was so horrified that a really profound thought and again it's just like.

248
00:28:19,93 --> 00:28:27,38
That is exactly the son's we were twenty min that's cool i love that that that. You know life can evolve and that.

249
00:28:27,38 --> 00:28:51,09
Kids. I mean our kids have got something new to do rather than wearing you know. Born children. Less is that. I think.

250
00:28:51,09 --> 00:29:00,96
Yeah. Stein. Yeah. Yeah well. Drugs were very large part of my life.

251
00:29:00,96 --> 00:29:10,12
The thing for the first twelve or thirteen years that i lived here. And on every level.

252
00:29:10,12 --> 00:29:24,31
You know a socially economically. But i was i were a large power and and. I think. I think on a good.

253
00:29:24,31 --> 00:29:32,19
You know i don't regret those dies. I think that was good tons of those bad hons in those. Tragic tones but.

254
00:29:32,19 --> 00:29:40,3
I think that was what i needed to get through to two. To spiritually grotty to evolve or maim.

255
00:29:40,3 --> 00:29:45,69
That whole drug thing something that i needed to go through and come out the other end and then really.

256
00:29:45,69 --> 00:29:52,7
There's something that i had to experience and it's. It was not good. You know. Cancel.

257
00:29:52,7 --> 00:29:59,52
Judges all parents or anyone telling me. What was right and what was wrong and what was going to happen. By sickly.

258
00:29:59,85 --> 00:30:09,55
Oh i had to go through it and went through it and coming out the other in probably a lot stronger and better off for.

259
00:30:09,55 --> 00:30:15,41
Other people have and i mean other people dawdle on the one i was lucky. I think. I think.

260
00:30:15,41 --> 00:30:22,5
Compared to a lot of my friends who stayed in the city. I think living in. Leading this involvement.

261
00:30:22,5 --> 00:30:28,66
And in this community where the shoes were a lot more than and then discussed and.

262
00:30:31,64 --> 00:30:34,22
Yeah i think on the i'll probably survive.

263
00:30:34,22 --> 00:30:39,36
My addiction a lot better than a lot of my friends in the city did and i think.

264
00:30:39,36 --> 00:30:48,41
You know on all levels on particularly health wise. I'm alison leigh. I wasn't as.

265
00:30:48,41 --> 00:30:52,92
I wasn't as oscillated in the community here because of my diction.

266
00:30:53,41 --> 00:31:01,62
I was always taken for who i was and what i did not the fact that i was just and that it was. This time and.

267
00:31:01,62 --> 00:31:10,06
Not like now. You know attics of bill thaw and. Pretty much. And in the general society but i'm. In the alternative.

268
00:31:10,06 --> 00:31:17,67
Community over the years when i was using. Not so much you're basically. If you're an addict i mean that that that.

269
00:31:17,67 --> 00:31:24,96
That came second. To who you were and had your way in and. Yeah i think.

270
00:31:26,38 --> 00:31:31,09
Oh i think i was definitely better off being an addict in the country than i was in the city.
