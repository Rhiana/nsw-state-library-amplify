1
00:00:25,83 --> 00:00:36,97
I am c. C. A b. My name's pauline mccabe and. On the net your past.

2
00:00:37,72 --> 00:00:48,71
I work in a small business called the neiman apothecary and. I've been living in this area for about five years now.

3
00:00:50,9 --> 00:01:00,39
I first came up here about six or seven years ago to visit friends who had bought into a multiple occupancy up here.

4
00:01:00,39 --> 00:01:09,24
And. I really love the area and. Realized at the time that i could buy.

5
00:01:09,24 --> 00:01:16,38
A hassle land up here for much less money than it would cost me in melbourne. Which was definitely an attraction but.

6
00:01:16,38 --> 00:01:23,48
I suppose chiefly it was really the natural beauty all these areas. That drew me and still does.

7
00:01:23,48 --> 00:01:36,26
Apart from the alternative culture. With alternative medicine in nimbin probably started.

8
00:01:36,26 --> 00:01:40,67
At the aquarius festival i think they were i wasn't there but they were.

9
00:01:40,67 --> 00:01:49,09
Healing storms and message and all of that sort of thing. Occurring at the time in nineteen seventy three and then.

10
00:01:49,09 --> 00:01:59,48
Amongst the people who say that he is following that they were quite a number of natural therapists and.

11
00:01:59,48 --> 00:02:07,08
I suppose one of the this dangerous activities iran which this. Which became a sort of cool.

12
00:02:07,08 --> 00:02:16,98
And magnet phonetical healing was based on beyond. You know that booth and beyond. So booth and beyond.

13
00:02:16,98 --> 00:02:24,58
Catering for pregnant women and and booths it had. Were also very much involved in natural therapy. Yes and.

14
00:02:24,58 --> 00:02:32,96
They actually taught themselves some of them. The midwives things like cable me to sit in homeopathy.

15
00:02:32,96 --> 00:02:41,03
They were a couple of trained. Acupuncturists. And. They kind of stayed up healing. Center in name been which.

16
00:02:41,03 --> 00:02:47,85
Revolved around booth and beyond. And i think that was the beginning of ish and.

17
00:02:47,85 --> 00:02:54,73
With a was at the twenty's ago car pressure release more they might have been but apart from the edge.

18
00:02:54,73 --> 00:03:03,35
My understanding is that there was no other sort of natural medicine. And since that time.

19
00:03:03,35 --> 00:03:12,67
I mean both and beyond is still going it's been a very successful. Case of community development in health katie.

20
00:03:12,67 --> 00:03:18,17
Run by. Equally by trying midwives limeade wives and mothers.

21
00:03:18,17 --> 00:03:32,45
And fourteen years down the track it's to quote a vaudeville and father and organization. So simply.

22
00:03:32,45 --> 00:03:38,01
With all the new state was that kind of the area where a significant number of natural therapists of all kinds

23
00:03:38,01 --> 00:03:39,23
and it's become.

24
00:03:39,23 --> 00:03:47,86
The whole area has become very well known for all kinds of natural medicine and that has spread from name been.

25
00:03:47,86 --> 00:04:07,94
Chile's more annoy other surrounding towns. So this. Will only major modellers he's represented which.

26
00:04:07,94 --> 00:04:15,91
Car practical now is to york to see. Jaimie up with the. Hable medicine. Net you up with the and.

27
00:04:15,91 --> 00:04:25,25
Traditional chinese medicine which bicycling clude seche puncher and. Chinese have a medicine and. From that they read.

28
00:04:25,25 --> 00:04:33,86
Many other lease unknown sorts of theory piece such as. Polarity therapy reflexology.

29
00:04:33,86 --> 00:04:50,55
All cons of alternative psychological therapies such as rebirthing. Chop theory piece. In el pais just to name a few.

30
00:04:50,55 --> 00:05:09,44
There are many many off them. Was. It was. So was i knew it. Well i think that healing is an instinct that.

31
00:05:09,44 --> 00:05:23,56
Everybody has and. It's a very creative. Activity. And think that. There's generally throughout society a growing.

32
00:05:23,56 --> 00:05:26,22
Move to take responsibility for one's own health

33
00:05:26,22 --> 00:05:34,56
and a lot of the people that get involved in healing start off by healing the illnesses. Be the name on it.

34
00:05:34,56 --> 00:05:42,27
And through that they develop an interest in the natural medicine so that list unless these people go to doctors

35
00:05:42,27 --> 00:05:44,56
and type drugs and.

36
00:05:44,56 --> 00:05:47,11
Resort to suit your and they try all sorts of on the mains

37
00:05:47,11 --> 00:05:52,83
and then they might be going to get some for some training

38
00:05:52,83 --> 00:05:58,36
and become qualified natural therapists in some field that interests them. Well maybe they don't.

39
00:05:58,36 --> 00:06:08,86
Maybe they just continue to practice. As unqualified therapists in areas of the listen modalities such as.

40
00:06:08,86 --> 00:06:12,87
You know message and crystal therapy and things not bad.

41
00:06:12,87 --> 00:06:14,48
Could basically i see it is

42
00:06:14,48 --> 00:06:23,54
and is sort of part of the wide a social movement towards taking responsibility for one's own health. Taking it at.

43
00:06:23,59 --> 00:06:31,49
Of the hands of other people and. Learning hatch to improve your health and be healthy.

44
00:06:31,49 --> 00:06:35,75
Not waiting until you get sick and then going to see a so called experience.

45
00:06:39,49 --> 00:07:00,46
Attempts to manage your situation with drugs was sued yuri. Fringe was. This one.

46
00:07:14,2 --> 00:07:18,8
Well basically i think there's growing acceptance of natural therapies simply because they would.

47
00:07:19,55 --> 00:07:23,11
That's why they right away and and.

48
00:07:23,11 --> 00:07:29,6
The ones that stick with us and the ones that are becoming gradually mainstream set. Such as car practic which you now.

49
00:07:29,6 --> 00:07:30,97
Go to university to live in

50
00:07:30,97 --> 00:07:37,38
and you become qualified is it as a doctor of car practic that's happened because it's valid in it

51
00:07:37,38 --> 00:07:47,21
when it's better than. You with a doc's medical approach to lots of complaints and that's been proven now by. Research.

52
00:07:47,21 --> 00:07:48,3
And of course there'd be no

53
00:07:48,3 --> 00:07:53,58
and natural therapies which haven't attracted much interest haven't been particularly successful

54
00:07:53,58 --> 00:08:09,65
and they have fooling away. When i'm trying to think of as an example we know i've lost count think of it. And.

55
00:08:09,65 --> 00:08:12,85
But the mainstream theory piece you know such as him medicine.

56
00:08:12,85 --> 00:08:18,27
And acupuncture and tie me up with you and started with this new day growing because they're effective.

57
00:08:19,1 --> 00:08:26,11
And even within the ranks of the medical profession itself now we have a growing numbers of young doctors who are

58
00:08:26,11 --> 00:08:34,13
taking up these therapies. And taking up the concept also of holistic medicine which is to treat the whole person.

59
00:08:34,13 --> 00:08:42,74
To interact with the whole puce and during the process of the theory of huge consultation and.

60
00:08:43,58 --> 00:08:51,99
Along with that has come the advent of the multi-disciplinary clinic way you get medical doctors working alongside.

61
00:08:51,99 --> 00:08:55,24
Natural therapists and psychologists for example.

62
00:08:55,24 --> 00:09:03,32
You know group practice in referring clients to each other according to what would be the most suitable upright ch.

63
00:09:04,87 --> 00:09:21,32
So those things. I think you know straining it. It's fairly unique in tombs in the womb. You know struggle.

64
00:09:21,44 --> 00:09:23,75
We have developed.

65
00:09:23,75 --> 00:09:26,57
Well i'm a net your pet so that's the field that i know the based

66
00:09:26,57 --> 00:09:33,88
but we have developed a kind of synthesis of various natural syria piece which hasn't occurred widely elsewhere in the

67
00:09:33,88 --> 00:09:41,59
wood. In natural with the study table me to sin homeopathy nutrition vitamin and mineral therapy. And so you have.

68
00:09:41,59 --> 00:09:52,1
I combined upright. And it's very effective and. Because of that we have. I mean there have been a number of studies.

69
00:09:52,1 --> 00:09:59,34
Particularly in victoria and inquiries i should say government inquiries. And some research. Which is proven that that.

70
00:09:59,45 --> 00:10:05,68
The outcomes of natural therapies that patients are very happy with the manette chapin's have the least number of

71
00:10:05,68 --> 00:10:25,25
compliance to the consumer. Complaint department and. Must be trained. You have to get me gaghan.

72
00:10:25,25 --> 00:10:31,04
Fringe elements we're talking about. Plus.

73
00:10:39,32 --> 00:10:47,88
Apart from the imagine that adela he switched to bet there are lots of sort of other good spirit piece that kind of on

74
00:10:47,88 --> 00:10:52,28
the fringe of natural need to sin. Such as crystal healing and.

75
00:10:54,3 --> 00:11:01,92
Rebirthing and all of those sorts of things that are abandoned in the sea area.

76
00:11:03,33 --> 00:11:09,84
Personally i think that that healing is a very sort of individual and creative in

77
00:11:09,84 --> 00:11:23,17
when i speak at one end of it speak german and. That ad of the community at a grassroots level who periodically spring..

78
00:11:19,79 --> 00:11:25,43
Through some individual and you theory p. And for an example of that used p.

79
00:11:25,43 --> 00:11:29,3
Which was developed by a man called tom bowman dan engine long.

80
00:11:29,3 --> 00:11:36,67
He was just a very in she would have body wicked and jet. Developed a sort of soft tissue chock of.

81
00:11:36,67 --> 00:11:43,83
Approach to all sorts of. You back. Muscular and joint problems. And he's approach is now being too.

82
00:11:43,83 --> 00:11:54,05
And it's very successful. So that's just an example and. I think that we. We always have to remain open to.

83
00:11:54,61 --> 00:12:03,38
The big scene a sense of new therapies. Into the wound and. Those that are not valid. For the way and those that.

84
00:12:04,51 --> 00:12:13,19
Develop and grow and. Eventually become a widely practiced therapy i mean this was the case with car practic.

85
00:12:13,19 --> 00:12:24,68
For example in america. Developed by a man called palm up. And he was not a trained medical practitioner.

86
00:12:27,57 --> 00:12:31,82
And spies over thousands of years that all sorts of therapies have initially.

87
00:12:31,82 --> 00:12:37,86
Began with one individual who was fascinated by healing and somehow the vision kind of them.

88
00:12:39,03 --> 00:12:55,91
Suddenly you will gradually if you go about your life being a particular approach. And then other people. You can say.

89
00:12:55,91 --> 00:13:03,12
Ok. You get a lot of different himself a natural therapy such as complementary medicine.

90
00:13:03,12 --> 00:13:11,99
Which is the tune that's increasingly being used for the six major my delicate he's also on to medicine

91
00:13:11,99 --> 00:13:13,52
but that's becoming.

92
00:13:13,61 --> 00:13:20,36
Kind of least popular because it's sort of divisive another chinese holistic medicine

93
00:13:20,36 --> 00:13:27,35
and that's a particular tune that has been taken up with the medical profession and news seeing.

94
00:13:27,35 --> 00:13:34,41
And there certainly is a growing group within those orthodox professions. A kind of.

95
00:13:34,41 --> 00:13:36,61
Breakaway group which is developing.

96
00:13:36,61 --> 00:13:44,11
What they call holistic medicine and we need a friend of reference holistic medicine. Is the way you approach.

97
00:13:44,11 --> 00:13:47,76
The client the kind of interaction that you have that.

98
00:13:47,76 --> 00:13:52,35
Instead of just the doctor sitting across the disk from a patient who is just a physical entity.

99
00:13:52,35 --> 00:13:55,3
A machine made up of running pats.

100
00:13:55,3 --> 00:14:01,64
That chet the holistic doctor recognizes that he's talking to pierce and with you my spiritual

101
00:14:01,64 --> 00:14:12,29
and main two components zero energy fields you could say. And so the holistic. Practitioner. Not any doctors but.

102
00:14:12,29 --> 00:14:20,68
Yet your therapist says well. Interacts with the client in that way and sometimes when you.

103
00:14:20,68 --> 00:14:33,03
When you open up a consultation. To include all those other levels of being then it allows a safe place for food.

104
00:14:33,03 --> 00:14:36,78
For example for expression of stress

105
00:14:36,78 --> 00:14:41,96
and emotional difficulties which have been contributing to physical disorders so that.

106
00:14:41,96 --> 00:14:51,49
Sometimes one doesn't even need to prescribe anything. And healing can.

107
00:14:51,49 --> 00:14:58,62
At the very least be helped along on a new label by the person being allowed to express the full spectrum of these

108
00:14:58,62 --> 00:15:07,58
symptoms not just the physical ones but all the other things that are a patent passing. The whole sale.

109
00:15:13,05 --> 00:15:19,81
Extremely differ. Because. Holistic medicine is very different from the traditional.

110
00:15:19,81 --> 00:15:27,48
Orthodox medical approach because orthodox made its news by stone reductionist science and that.

111
00:15:27,48 --> 00:15:35,57
Developed out of the cottage in philosophy. Of analysis. We have by any.

112
00:15:35,57 --> 00:15:44,42
Believed what could absolutely and irrefutably be proven and. With a net context. We that science has a d.s.

113
00:15:44,42 --> 00:15:50,26
We have largely been able to prove things within the physical realm.

114
00:15:53,15 --> 00:15:55,68
Particularly within medical science physics is a whole different matter

115
00:15:55,68 --> 00:16:05,65
and the new physics is starting to affect us at how society really. In different ways but that's a whole different.

116
00:16:05,65 --> 00:16:11,45
Masha. So the traditional doctor i need to build on the physical because that was the area.

117
00:16:11,45 --> 00:16:21,75
Which was in which he's made a sin is proven. Can be proven to have predictable. Effects and. So he can watch.

118
00:16:21,75 --> 00:16:33,32
A sickly move at side of that physical area. He's banned by it. According to the tenets of scientific medicine.

119
00:16:33,32 --> 00:16:39,78
Of course you get individual doctors to. Real human beings. With healing.

120
00:16:39,78 --> 00:16:44,16
Ability who do me that side of that room who spend time talking to people.

121
00:16:44,16 --> 00:16:49,37
Particularly within the holistic medical movement but it was said there are other good.

122
00:16:49,37 --> 00:16:52,68
Doctors who relate to people more widely now.

123
00:16:52,68 --> 00:16:57,53
Particularly because people demand that and shop around for doctors who will treat them as paypal.

124
00:17:00,35 --> 00:17:20,23
So it is extremely different holistic medicine. Use. So this is almost. So first. Yes ok.

125
00:17:22,06 --> 00:17:31,93
The basis of all systems of medicine. Really is shamanic medicine which is right across the world in every continent.

126
00:17:31,93 --> 00:17:46,37
Continent. By sickly seeming that. The shah. Is a sort of combination who blissed and psychologist and. Priest and.

127
00:17:46,37 --> 00:17:54,94
We all started off like that thousands of years ago. And then. In areas of civilization such as greece. China india.

128
00:17:54,94 --> 00:18:03,89
More sophisticated. Types of medicine came into being gradually which is. For example with her properties.

129
00:18:03,89 --> 00:18:12,61
Approached healing through. Diet should have been made assumes climate change. Exercise.

130
00:18:12,61 --> 00:18:23,15
Those sorts of areas and that was the western tradition of medicine food. About fifteen thousand knees probably.

131
00:18:28,72 --> 00:18:37,87
Until it was i have a tune by the development of science particularly with di catchin his method of analysis.

132
00:18:39,25 --> 00:18:44,2
So we have in the west and we have a history of conflict between it with the docs

133
00:18:44,2 --> 00:18:48,31
and the new with doc's medicine which didn't happen in india and china.

134
00:18:48,31 --> 00:18:54,00
In china they had five thousand years of an interrupt to development of the natural medicine

135
00:18:54,00 --> 00:19:02,55
and it's a very sophisticated model in the western world. We had. Well. Probably the conflict started to bet.

136
00:19:02,55 --> 00:19:03,44
Round about the u.

137
00:19:03,44 --> 00:19:05,83
Twelve hundred when the first universities came into being

138
00:19:05,83 --> 00:19:12,51
and medicine shifted into the study of medicine she fit into the university system and. There was the elite.

139
00:19:12,51 --> 00:19:20,83
Medical system practiced. By those who were university trained and they will feed people who could patronize than.

140
00:19:20,83 --> 00:19:29,96
Which was a minority of people and. Other than that they was just grassroots folk. Medicine and.

141
00:19:29,96 --> 00:19:38,61
The situation we do along fool. The last eight hundred years with the sort of vilification of commuters to new guy.

142
00:19:38,61 --> 00:19:42,59
University trying to paper when you have to bear in mind that.

143
00:19:42,59 --> 00:19:47,28
Scientific medicine i knew began about three hundred years ago it's a project that for hundreds of years we had

144
00:19:47,28 --> 00:19:54,7
vilification of folk medicine because it was practiced by unlimited people who didn't know anything about philosophy.

145
00:19:55,42 --> 00:20:03,36
Didn't speak latin. Didn't know the theories of the guy human. It's a trap. So it's interesting.

146
00:20:03,36 --> 00:20:10,04
A sociological thing that there's been that speech. It hasn't. Wristed on science to do science.

147
00:20:10,04 --> 00:20:17,22
Was it useful to for them to race to pond. Through the d.n.a. Great natural medicine.

148
00:20:18,18 --> 00:20:32,68
But that's changing too gradually. That's coming.

149
00:20:33,25 --> 00:20:39,38
Well in this area and at least move because of the wide community interest in.

150
00:20:39,38 --> 00:20:43,09
Natural medicine and because we have a university he which is.

151
00:20:43,09 --> 00:20:53,7
The any entrepreneurial and interested in reflecting community interests. They have approved a three year curriculum.

152
00:20:53,7 --> 00:20:59,62
For a bachelor's degree and next year up the. And also similar i think in traditional chinese medicine.

153
00:20:59,62 --> 00:21:07,81
So those courses are actually approved but not yet funded and. Funding could be some ease away.

154
00:21:07,81 --> 00:21:13,52
But it's really a fascinating development and if it. If we get net europe at the into the university here it will be.

155
00:21:13,67 --> 00:21:25,56
To my knowledge of first in the western world. And it will mean that for the first time a night hundred years is.

156
00:21:25,56 --> 00:21:35,01
The traditional media soon. We will move much closer to a place of equality with elite with adox medicine.

157
00:21:35,01 --> 00:21:54,94
And that is it. A fascinating development. And so much potential. Possible because things. It's it's because.

158
00:21:54,94 --> 00:22:08,26
You know strata. I think name has been very important in the development of natural therapies in the sea area.

159
00:22:08,26 --> 00:22:17,06
I don't think that it's been an impetus astronomy wide because people who qualified natural therapist in this area have

160
00:22:17,06 --> 00:22:18,71
try and elsewhere.

161
00:22:18,71 --> 00:22:26,68
And there are very advanced stages of natural medicine in melbourne and sydney and brisbane particularly

162
00:22:26,68 --> 00:22:33,86
but all of the chinese private in private colleges. No that's not true. They are now.

163
00:22:33,86 --> 00:22:35,9
University courses in acupuncture.

164
00:22:36,33 --> 00:22:44,35
You know melbourne and pierce i think and possibly sydney in-car practic in austria with the melbourne.

165
00:22:44,35 --> 00:22:51,6
These are of course starting up in brisbane college next year in homeopathy. Classical hammy up with these.

166
00:22:51,6 --> 00:22:59,96
So it certainly on the move in a strain yeah and i think that's why we're getting a backlash if legislation. Happening.

167
00:22:59,96 --> 00:23:03,6
Particularly straight the therapeutic goods act.

168
00:23:03,6 --> 00:23:08,51
Nimbin is interesting because of the numbers of people who practice in.

169
00:23:08,51 --> 00:23:15,01
Not only nieman but the whole know with an area. That's a real sort of hotbed of natural medicine and.

170
00:23:17,26 --> 00:23:24,91
So it has the potential to become a very important say into. If we get the university. Course here.

171
00:23:51,04 --> 00:23:55,96
Well the politics of health are really fascinating and very complex but. It's by sickly.

172
00:23:55,96 --> 00:24:02,31
Comes down to a palate struggle. Health care in this countries with billions and.

173
00:24:02,31 --> 00:24:05,64
It's a vosh who compiled into that entire economy.

174
00:24:07,51 --> 00:24:13,33
And if suddenly i have a nod to all the people who could benefit from my stream natural medicine was shifted out of

175
00:24:13,33 --> 00:24:19,41
that system probably our economy would collapse. Because of it. Of course that's a hypothetical situation that.

176
00:24:19,41 --> 00:24:24,52
I just wanted to rise that point to show you how important it is to our economy and.

177
00:24:24,52 --> 00:24:30,69
Consequently the control of it is extremely important. And.

178
00:24:30,69 --> 00:24:36,59
And the fact dissidents try to get people voting with a fit and.

179
00:24:36,59 --> 00:24:41,55
Moving in the thousands every year it towards natural medicine.

180
00:24:41,55 --> 00:24:47,28
These johnny natural therapies dissociation estimates now that there is something like ten million consultations with.

181
00:24:47,28 --> 00:24:53,61
Natural therapists. You know who you are and that in fact. This is actually saving x.

182
00:24:53,61 --> 00:24:57,00
Country a lot of money into hands of the health dollar.

183
00:24:57,00 --> 00:25:00,68
Because it's all paid for out of the private pocket

184
00:25:00,68 --> 00:25:07,5
and that it probably sized people surgery for example it saves hospital days it gets people back to work weekends.

185
00:25:07,5 --> 00:25:11,36
And that's really a one on the right sort of. Estimates made of.

186
00:25:11,36 --> 00:25:25,22
What that is really with but you know good research on it says control of the health dolla. He's in niger issue.

187
00:25:25,22 --> 00:25:37,63
And because of the growing interest in natural therapies you know even within the medical profession. Is a backlash.

188
00:25:37,63 --> 00:25:39,67
Developing.

189
00:25:39,67 --> 00:25:45,93
Ever since i've been involved in natural medicine in the last twenty years we've had one to change dr another to show.

190
00:25:45,93 --> 00:25:47,65
To replace natural needed.

191
00:25:47,73 --> 00:25:54,4
And i mean back in the seventy's in victoria they wanted to ban us along with scientologists they put us into the same

192
00:25:54,4 --> 00:25:59,48
category. And they've been numerous inquiries into.

193
00:25:59,48 --> 00:26:09,9
Again in victoria where there's been the most activity there was one attempt to control. Vitamin and mineral therapy.

194
00:26:09,9 --> 00:26:13,54
And put it more substantially into the hands of the medical profession

195
00:26:13,54 --> 00:26:21,82
and that provoked an enormous public at cry they got more on the ages of that issue than any other issue. Politically.

196
00:26:21,82 --> 00:26:27,3
And so. Eventually they realised that they weren't going to succeed by trying to squash.

197
00:26:27,3 --> 00:26:31,61
The therapists themselves there was too much public support.

198
00:26:32,14 --> 00:26:38,41
And also with each inquiry they got least boston actually more open more interested in finding out what was really

199
00:26:38,41 --> 00:26:47,19
going on and so the best one so far has been the victorian social development committee. An all party inquiry.

200
00:26:47,19 --> 00:26:56,88
And i actually did some good research into things like as standard of education. Patient satisfaction.

201
00:26:58,31 --> 00:27:05,45
Reasons why people got a natural fear based on those sorts of things and it was a very fishy and. With while report.

202
00:27:05,59 --> 00:27:13,65
And interestingly. They came up with the. Finding that we didn't need to be registered because we do you know.

203
00:27:15,88 --> 00:27:17,45
And that was a real disappointment.

204
00:27:17,45 --> 00:27:24,61
To the natural fear because we wanted to be registered because we needed the protection of a registration system.

205
00:27:24,61 --> 00:27:33,54
To protect us from with a doc's medicine. But that. The inquiry into tory didn't perceive that as.

206
00:27:33,54 --> 00:27:39,28
They were they would look into that. So the tactics of shifted.

207
00:27:40,15 --> 00:27:44,16
We've now got the therapeutic goods department which used to be different in each state

208
00:27:44,16 --> 00:27:50,53
and because of that it was the rules and regulations would you. And you know each state it was a bit of a. Shemozzle.

209
00:27:50,53 --> 00:27:56,74
Really made. Into stage. Tried for example in. Natural therapies in the manufacture of difficult.

210
00:27:57,62 --> 00:28:00,94
Different libeling requirements new of that sort of thing.

211
00:28:00,94 --> 00:28:08,53
So they decided to make it a federal department by state can grant which in lots of respects was a good idea.

212
00:28:08,53 --> 00:28:14,45
It meant that everything could be sort of standardized from one central area about.

213
00:28:14,45 --> 00:28:24,54
Having got the passed into law as to who can read itin commenced to look at the contents of all sorts of medicines and.

214
00:28:24,54 --> 00:28:31,17
Anything that they could band on the sort of slightest pretext. For example comfrey that if you.

215
00:28:31,58 --> 00:28:41,37
Fog bucketfuls of comfrey a day you would get. Anything they can possibly banned is being banned.

216
00:28:41,37 --> 00:28:51,46
And it's an ongoing price it's not complete by any means and.

217
00:28:51,46 --> 00:29:00,7
The tenets that they're using the reasoning that they're using to ban these medicines is by stone. The k.

218
00:29:00,7 --> 00:29:05,8
Mystery of hoops according to the reductionist model. You break them down.

219
00:29:05,8 --> 00:29:12,48
Into component paths you found out which parts act even which parts are not which only depends on what they can prove

220
00:29:12,48 --> 00:29:16,72
in the in the bara trees. And if you find a particular ingredient.

221
00:29:16,72 --> 00:29:22,23
Which is usually the alkaloids which may be dangerous in large quantities that justifies its banning.

222
00:29:24,04 --> 00:29:37,3
But have lists that. Because of the seen. Action by that. Meaning the combined action of all of its different paths.

223
00:29:38,00 --> 00:29:47,53
In other words the holies greater than the sum of its parts in that when you put the alkaloids. Back into the.

224
00:29:47,53 --> 00:29:51,83
Contacts. Of the leaving plant with its components. That there are checks and balances.

225
00:29:51,83 --> 00:30:03,19
We mean that you made a sin and. That the taj plant has a healing. Path which is not being received.

226
00:30:03,19 --> 00:30:14,79
They don't know why. Comfrey wix why. Goldenseal wicks. Why most other humans weeks there has been some research. Now.

227
00:30:14,79 --> 00:30:20,79
To show that things do with for example st mary's thiessen which is a wonderful. Regenerative the liva.

228
00:30:22,48 --> 00:30:29,81
But the complexities of have those who actually got a bat. Creating these healing is not understood to do.

229
00:30:29,81 --> 00:30:33,86
So to ban them because when you break them down into paths and.

230
00:30:33,86 --> 00:30:41,76
If you would mean is to simply the alkaloids in large quantities in a person would get you to have a list is a nonsense.

231
00:30:42,42 --> 00:30:50,66
And we simply don't prescribe comfrey by the bucketful. And you. And him zero.

232
00:30:50,66 --> 00:30:55,65
Prescribed in combinations with each other you really give one who want it science so. If you give it here.

233
00:30:55,65 --> 00:31:02,31
Makes you without him seen it. The complex of varying active ingredients you know i need the alkaloids.

234
00:31:02,31 --> 00:31:08,8
The essential oils. The proteins that are all sorts of complex. Ingredients.

235
00:31:10,16 --> 00:31:20,13
The synergies to healing if it can be perceived as an outcome but how it works we don't know. So you have a medicine.

236
00:31:20,13 --> 00:31:27,81
And homeopathy has forward into the hands of a group of candor scientists who are using the method to determine what we

237
00:31:27,81 --> 00:31:33,93
are led to use in what we are knowledge as i see it as on trying to people you see.

238
00:31:33,93 --> 00:31:38,27
Because we don't have reduced ration because we don't have university education.

239
00:31:38,27 --> 00:31:43,83
That i can see to that we are not to be trusted. And the sane she reserve who. Tradition.

240
00:31:43,83 --> 00:31:49,19
Which we live in is meaningless. Within the context of the science.

241
00:31:50,55 --> 00:31:54,99
And so we think it's very important for us to keep fighting through university education and.
