1
00:00:12,84 --> 00:00:34,56
This is civil servant. That i was immediately. In a small town there in northern italy.

2
00:00:34,56 --> 00:00:37,08
To out of the wife or minister

3
00:00:37,08 --> 00:01:00,47
or do you what the actual town was called a battle for you here preaching from your parents. On the twenty seven.

4
00:01:00,47 --> 00:01:04,47
January diet until its winter in january.

5
00:01:04,47 --> 00:01:08,79
And i was very sickly and i don't expect me to really reflect

6
00:01:08,79 --> 00:01:13,25
but mr came downstairs to greet me because my mother told me.

7
00:01:13,25 --> 00:01:20,3
And when i was in italy my knowledge to tell me that you remember when i was born.

8
00:01:20,3 --> 00:01:30,48
And my father came down that morning. And he said not yet. And this is true because.

9
00:01:30,48 --> 00:01:44,58
Well as a private haven't showed him to have all together. Actually servants a lot of them. And i saw.

10
00:01:44,58 --> 00:01:50,43
One of the eyes of the nun. Actually she would have been my oldest children.

11
00:01:50,43 --> 00:02:02,9
To raise or she was a man she darted twenty yards in the corner and. Now i don't remember in utah.

12
00:02:05,67 --> 00:02:10,57
What perspective they had in the family. That is firing me remembering.

13
00:02:10,77 --> 00:02:31,89
If i can remember my mother sort of sighing and i have very strict catholic church was. To avoid morris.

14
00:02:31,89 --> 00:02:40,82
Well i had enough for about coming out to.

15
00:02:40,82 --> 00:02:50,81
My sister to tell me that the other guy or been trying and i don't remember anything about the trip.

16
00:02:50,81 --> 00:03:07,79
But our remembers me and my brother jack. That of course my mom was having a little bag. In my hand and some.

17
00:03:07,79 --> 00:03:22,47
And she said you only two weeks. So he was already. Twenty seven.

18
00:03:27,05 --> 00:03:45,06
My father came out of that we had no idea what was the attraction. Did he have the traction. To get out immediately.

19
00:03:45,06 --> 00:03:56,21
Because a lot. Was very high the younger brothers and sisters coming on so that the. Two boys really.

20
00:03:56,21 --> 00:04:20,43
Because they were the ones that were great and i think immigration to us from what. Do you think that.

21
00:04:20,43 --> 00:04:31,01
Just imagine a mother with two weeks out by one of her oldest son. But i think you could condition.

22
00:04:31,01 --> 00:04:46,42
Another why was probably late school or twelve. And i would be put out. To a magical place.

23
00:04:46,42 --> 00:04:55,45
Or to a friend supplies and from and. Probably for we're lucky to get a change of pliers.

24
00:04:56,28 --> 00:05:08,6
But that meant that the family didn't have faith in them. That's what they need. Now instead of better in mind right.

25
00:05:08,6 --> 00:05:29,04
Kind of attractive. With the intention to bring. To bring the whole family. That's how they planned it.

26
00:05:29,04 --> 00:05:57,69
At the time he had been working on mostly. You know. We have a wonderful. Creek or he was in sydney.

27
00:05:57,69 --> 00:06:10,57
And he came straight to me. And that's what brought you yesterday. He was the original one.

28
00:06:10,94 --> 00:06:25,44
Very very hard to get to you know i hope to learn from. Quickly so that when we come out.

29
00:06:26,5 --> 00:06:50,88
It's great that your daughter. Very much. Except that he had to go.

30
00:06:50,88 --> 00:07:16,84
Which was very very very hard work to do for the series and he went doing them for.

31
00:07:16,84 --> 00:07:49,82
Kind of iraq and actually had to get back to italy. And the family actually. Which will accept.

32
00:08:06,57 --> 00:08:26,48
My brother and my sister. And your mother. You know.

33
00:08:26,48 --> 00:08:48,76
My sister's or i can remember having that when when the very same brother. Do you remember your grandparents. You know.

34
00:08:48,76 --> 00:09:08,38
Not at all possible. I wouldn't. Couldn't you do you know much about them through. My brother. My father.

35
00:09:08,38 --> 00:09:14,7
Like that or there were only two in the family. He had one brother which was a very very small family.

36
00:09:17,19 --> 00:09:21,55
I don't think they use contraceptives. By the way. I just think i have them but.

37
00:09:21,55 --> 00:09:29,51
My grandmother didn't produce any more. So there were really world. Sort of.

38
00:09:29,51 --> 00:09:36,79
And they had to and my uncle and he had two boys come to my mother.

39
00:09:36,79 --> 00:09:45,03
My mother was a very good grace nightgown hair she kept the family going along the line dressmaking.

40
00:09:45,03 --> 00:09:56,79
What she would do nicely. She would for the rich people of this. And there were a few around. There will be.

41
00:09:56,79 --> 00:10:10,57
That woman to leave and she would go into the. Interest might take him. But she was breastfeeding. And the others were.

42
00:10:11,22 --> 00:10:26,49
With a sister in law. Because the family. Common to have forty people in the one house. That is the.

43
00:10:26,49 --> 00:10:31,95
Grandmother grandfather mother married son married sons

44
00:10:31,95 --> 00:10:55,95
and their children will be having the time of one this particular one. Had triplets. Life was very hard.

45
00:10:55,95 --> 00:11:04,09
And of course you wouldn't think of the children.

46
00:11:04,09 --> 00:11:05,69
So she was just at the end of the terrace

47
00:11:05,69 --> 00:11:13,72
or she went to the priest to ask for a company which is what they are you know that gave me a nice chat phrase that

48
00:11:13,72 --> 00:11:33,28
they have to carry the cross. And she was trying his cross van and.

49
00:11:33,28 --> 00:11:52,1
She got the count but wanted to have come from very close.

50
00:11:52,1 --> 00:12:06,55
Quite with a very young woman that i suppose i'm going to get back on going back now

51
00:12:06,55 --> 00:12:40,34
and i should get back to where we were hearing this. They want to go on. She was very young. She never thought.

52
00:12:40,34 --> 00:13:09,13
They were very short. Two weeks. Just about the last one of them. I was on the gun nuts. Which was cool.

53
00:13:09,13 --> 00:13:42,08
The coffee the coffee grounds and coffee. When i can remember my mother because we had children. Jack.

54
00:13:42,08 --> 00:13:54,58
Winter not like them could we have some some right now how hard can we having to separate the dairy farmers

55
00:13:54,58 --> 00:14:21,24
and taunt the. Coming. Country from. Rather and more dragging. Material. To build a house on the whole.

56
00:14:21,24 --> 00:14:45,58
Because there was no right to live this way that was being put on this law and that. From.

57
00:14:45,58 --> 00:15:06,63
Quite a few try and contact with military. So this country really comes to come to me and.

58
00:15:06,63 --> 00:15:57,2
So that must be a problem for me because i'm going to help build a house was my dream that would just one top of the.

59
00:15:57,2 --> 00:16:10,57
There was no law and of course. We had one. Which was not attached to the hair that. We had to carry the.

60
00:16:12,15 --> 00:16:58,85
Into the bathroom and cool. It was cool that we had to actually go into the house and really going to kitchen bathroom.

61
00:16:58,85 --> 00:17:04,41
It was a washed out of town and.

62
00:17:04,41 --> 00:18:10,57
Some rather got married and he took my life my lawyer saw for a long time on something.

63
00:18:12,97 --> 00:18:52,48
And because she has it all down larisa just pointed out in a bottle tea kettle that i can come up with some must drive.

64
00:18:53,45 --> 00:19:50,81
The car. Critters. Such a. Lot of time and. So i got the tour. That night. Of our. Country called.

65
00:19:55,45 --> 00:20:18,91
The last night which was running a lot better. That. Comply now i think that life was so much easier here.

66
00:20:18,91 --> 00:20:30,18
Life is so much easier for the poor people in australia because i don't have a major crisis

67
00:20:30,18 --> 00:20:38,91
and i don't think any of us. Actually had until we came to a strike me we're always in my power to mike.

68
00:20:38,91 --> 00:20:43,47
A lot of guys are still have the implements that i've been out here

69
00:20:43,47 --> 00:20:47,65
or in here that are probably asking for it no one else interested.

70
00:20:47,65 --> 00:21:21,37
He wouldn't try and clone the pram dressed like children dressed in a beautiful red dress and become you know the boys.

71
00:21:22,8 --> 00:21:35,42
And we all know. Except for mike you just do it so much on the very much what she looks right.

72
00:21:35,66 --> 00:22:06,35
I kind of remember a fact that she lost in stride why she didn't tell you that we took our question.

73
00:22:06,35 --> 00:22:13,1
In the word a really lot of italians here at the time because. The second family.

74
00:22:13,1 --> 00:22:24,42
Has a family here kind of the first one was bad that they had come to yet. Actually through.

75
00:22:24,42 --> 00:22:30,29
My last year in the family life. We have not had a close knit. Italian community with sort of brain.

76
00:22:30,29 --> 00:22:41,92
Because we have a nominee for a why. We sort of haven't had a lot. With italian. When we first wind up.

77
00:22:41,92 --> 00:22:53,24
We didn't have right or wrong. Having a family the kind that was interesting.

78
00:22:53,24 --> 00:23:01,61
And that's my no you certainly am marrying one of your own son. But not very far away there was a kind.

79
00:23:01,61 --> 00:23:12,77
And there was a local carrier there used to take them. But come to light on them but they were on your stride.

80
00:23:13,97 --> 00:23:19,87
It was dr. What kind of business.

81
00:23:19,87 --> 00:23:29,51
Well i'm sure i just remember the first day that my brother and my father would have had a vegetable garden. I'm sure.

82
00:23:29,51 --> 00:23:43,94
Some thought might want to chill out and would have very little made such that we would have had chicken chicken.

83
00:23:43,94 --> 00:23:54,62
We would have might have nothing right. That called out and this is a very good level of care.

84
00:23:54,62 --> 00:23:59,28
Within my life so much simpler for us because it was really a lot of lawn.

85
00:23:59,28 --> 00:24:05,64
That would probably would have been there but having gone doing them.

86
00:24:05,64 --> 00:24:10,57
You would that we got a little bit of money that way and. Having a side that. Have it.

87
00:24:11,24 --> 00:24:28,06
And if you go with the back of course what you did was put the lads be sure to do. Much with. When the crane kind of.

88
00:24:28,06 --> 00:24:38,22
Top you would skim some of the cream out but not all that matter. Where you would mix a cherry.

89
00:24:38,22 --> 00:24:58,33
And i have that with my. What was left with my recorder and very it was claimed that it was them.

90
00:24:58,33 --> 00:25:08,08
We have would you call them. Droids you had the much.

91
00:25:08,08 --> 00:25:19,76
You that work when there were nothing bad would suddenly have pressure you and the rest were to go with this.

92
00:25:21,69 --> 00:25:37,42
That would last all year then when i called some of them. Some of them being near the salad. And the rest.

93
00:25:37,42 --> 00:25:51,35
So that the individual that grew. It was really a tasty meal. And also full of vitamin. Much needed vitamins.

94
00:25:51,35 --> 00:26:07,83
Yes we have a machine which is the one. I have now actually turned them around. My sister and. I have made next to you.

95
00:26:07,83 --> 00:26:24,61
And we also. And tonight the brave are used and i get at them a kulak. If you get something from a contemporary jacket.

96
00:26:26,14 --> 00:26:32,92
I should know more about that but i guess. From what i've seen.

97
00:26:32,92 --> 00:26:43,76
I want to know what would you probably read

98
00:26:43,76 --> 00:26:54,79
when you hit me you'll probably agree which you would not embrace that isn't good enough. But that wasn't half of the.

99
00:26:54,79 --> 00:27:01,17
What we had to do which annoyed me that it was that when i was ready to need.

100
00:27:01,17 --> 00:27:05,6
Having we were big family and we used to probably end you might get every two or three day.

101
00:27:05,6 --> 00:27:15,19
You know that we had a two three clear. And i met. One i mean. Would be to create.

102
00:27:15,19 --> 00:27:20,16
With about three of them and or through a long. Handle.

103
00:27:20,16 --> 00:27:25,14
And it took two people one person would turn the dow up and one person would go up

104
00:27:25,14 --> 00:27:31,91
and down with a handled that way that was pushing the very man and the handle kind. It would need it.

105
00:27:31,91 --> 00:27:40,13
And i don't mind job. With that handle and i live with it working hard work but it just annoyed me and.

106
00:27:40,13 --> 00:27:46,58
I don't i why i just hated that differ actually i don't know if you are going to hide it it was probably later on

107
00:27:46,58 --> 00:27:55,01
because i was young. Or that we had to take home. My brain just grew and. I wanted to be like everybody else.

108
00:27:55,01 --> 00:28:04,81
I hated my. Very endearing. I'm a male. That's a little knew what was that. But i really like that my brain.

109
00:28:04,81 --> 00:28:14,02
That's what you try to school. Oh yeah. That's what we had we used to buy the tree the flag. Much that.

110
00:28:14,02 --> 00:28:25,12
Should go it's kind of cool. You have that have to be brought up by the carrier and gone and picked up with two.

111
00:28:33,06 --> 00:28:50,47
Better. Kind actually. You know it's coming into my. I think that's already out. When they're calling.

112
00:28:50,47 --> 00:28:56,04
But you haven't read the lot. That's what they call them.

113
00:28:57,06 --> 00:29:04,6
She knew all about that because it was very much larger than what they used in my political career.

114
00:29:04,6 --> 00:29:17,95
That we do a lot of you know with a lot of. Years just a lot.

115
00:29:17,95 --> 00:29:50,29
And if you want to turn it into a member you just might have something that will just. Race. To to. Remember the brain.

116
00:29:58,18 --> 00:30:15,89
Can. Would have been phrased. How that would have probably gotten a good living. Praise the kind. Really cool.

117
00:30:15,89 --> 00:30:25,69
The problem. A lot we have learned from this trying to create the barack who used to write.

118
00:30:28,35 --> 00:30:46,65
Or how you put up with the top of that name and did. That work with a batter like that to actually turn a corner.

119
00:30:53,27 --> 00:31:18,41
Did you have to. Actually google this one on how much not affect on you. But. I have a lot. But help. In the cheap.

120
00:31:19,7 --> 00:31:42,58
Rascals. When you write at all. Little boy and all. I had to help. And the life that. I think i would have been a week.

121
00:31:42,58 --> 00:31:55,65
And went up the hill. People that my brother knew. Right now. Because he came. And i'll never forget it.

122
00:31:55,65 --> 00:32:00,23
Because the club.
