1
00:00:12,39 --> 00:00:46,11
So six seven. Last year. Yeah yeah yeah. J.k. Mcfarlane mc. If a r a n g. If you can. My name is jan.

2
00:00:46,11 --> 00:00:51,62
I worked during the aquarius testable. For the aquarius foundation. I went away for five years.

3
00:00:51,62 --> 00:00:57,83
And then i came back and had children. And haven't really gone anywhere. I now manage a local business.

4
00:00:58,52 --> 00:01:04,93
My name's jay and. I also worked on a query yes first of all.

5
00:01:07,31 --> 00:01:12,59
At the end of the first i want to run away as far as a coup.

6
00:01:12,59 --> 00:01:26,69
Somehow ended up back here again and i have my own business. Within the terms. Golly.

7
00:01:26,69 --> 00:01:40,38
The truth the whole truth and nothing. But i can write. Accidentally accidentally.

8
00:01:40,38 --> 00:01:45,23
If things are merely accidents and if that's the case.

9
00:01:45,23 --> 00:01:52,88
But i had already been in north queensland for about eighteen months after dropping out of sydney.

10
00:01:52,88 --> 00:02:00,2
And came back to sydney because at first when you leave the city you don't know how to survive really.

11
00:02:00,2 --> 00:02:05,2
And my skills were coming quite slowly and so i had to do a couple of four eyes back to the city.

12
00:02:05,2 --> 00:02:08,87
And i'm one of them are running to my friend precious who said.

13
00:02:09,1 --> 00:02:18,2
We're going to name of course for you what for so he explained about the festival and. What was likely to happen and.

14
00:02:18,2 --> 00:02:25,48
We want to come and work our source and sitting with a friend of mine. And so we said yes and.

15
00:02:25,48 --> 00:02:31,79
We again went back to queens and then came. Specially to work on the first. In the january.

16
00:02:31,79 --> 00:02:45,92
So just we were we were very idealistic then incredibly idealistic as well as. Fairly footloose and fancy for a no.

17
00:02:45,92 --> 00:02:54,59
If something sounds exciting. Because we weren't employed. We could just go there and.

18
00:02:54,59 --> 00:03:03,91
Fairly feel a sense both in those ties to a lot of carriage around. Well i had just returned home from india and.

19
00:03:03,91 --> 00:03:12,31
I was in a spot of trouble i suppose you could say. And it was a way out. And i had friends that were living here and.

20
00:03:12,31 --> 00:03:25,81
So i disappeared. And made myself very scarce. I was there i came here and.

21
00:03:25,81 --> 00:03:29,89
Moved into a band with a number of people being one of them.

22
00:03:29,89 --> 00:03:35,59
And we worked on setting up the rainbow cafe which was really good fun. We did used to spend a lot of time.

23
00:03:35,59 --> 00:03:40,43
Culling one another. Playing you cooking and cuddling priorities.

24
00:03:40,43 --> 00:03:44,4
Was one of the biggest features of the festival was the amount of cuddling and.

25
00:03:44,4 --> 00:03:47,74
It was definitely in the days of flower power.

26
00:03:47,74 --> 00:03:55,62
And end of life solution we went to lasting each other because everybody would catch it straightaway.

27
00:03:55,62 --> 00:04:04,74
And i really truly. I saw it for the truck to come in from brisbane and. The truck driver who was a little bit.

28
00:04:04,74 --> 00:04:11,88
Sly used to call out in the middle of the street hive. You want to go running.

29
00:04:11,88 --> 00:04:14,75
But everyone would be infected again like i think.

30
00:04:14,75 --> 00:04:18,3
I traveled all over india and never caught me and i couldn't play

31
00:04:18,3 --> 00:04:22,79
but they would be virtually jumping off a name for being so i mean really there were gross.

32
00:04:22,79 --> 00:04:32,56
You know you experienced them before the recent brushes and you know. They were using here with me.

33
00:04:32,56 --> 00:04:43,2
Funky i think you can see. Well everyone was very into hair which. Your bones. Was a terrible example.

34
00:04:43,2 --> 00:04:51,82
But it was a great deal of fun. There's a lot of. Lovely sharing lots of campfires and. Music and.

35
00:04:51,82 --> 00:04:58,18
Management was it right from going because most of us come out of. Nuclear family isolation.

36
00:04:58,39 --> 00:05:03,87
So this was where it was really at. And it was around the time when actually it was discovery.

37
00:05:03,87 --> 00:05:09,07
Being discovered on a large scale with young people and so there was an enormous amount of heart opening.

38
00:05:09,07 --> 00:05:13,17
And people thought that this was the best thing that ever happened and. Turned in.

39
00:05:13,17 --> 00:05:16,82
I think a lot of people have said to me that it was a turning point in their lives.

40
00:05:16,82 --> 00:05:22,05
And that their attitudes changed at that point in time and massively related.

41
00:05:22,05 --> 00:05:33,93
New attitudes that maybe they have used as a basis for how they've conducted themselves from here on in a lot of group

42
00:05:33,93 --> 00:05:38,95
a lot of things done in circles. A lot of sharing.

43
00:05:38,95 --> 00:05:45,83
I think also taking my friends together and story telling lots of story telling and

44
00:05:45,83 --> 00:05:48,38
and finding value in your own story.

45
00:05:48,38 --> 00:05:54,72
Which i think what's so great about what you're doing because it does it gives value to people's lives to hear their

46
00:05:54,72 --> 00:06:03,7
own stories. And it also gives value to your life when you stop and look at why you've done. Things or not may.

47
00:06:03,7 --> 00:06:14,35
Makes a special focus think it's great stuff. I am so very much.

48
00:06:14,35 --> 00:06:20,01
And there were a lot of evenings held at the rainbow cafe were with people who were involved in the setting up of the

49
00:06:20,01 --> 00:06:24,9
festival who would get up and sing. And encourage others to sing so there was a lot of that sort of.

50
00:06:24,9 --> 00:06:26,5
Group sharing that.

51
00:06:26,5 --> 00:06:33,56
Maybe people hadn't really experienced that we first i said we came out of new families i mean obviously a lot of

52
00:06:33,56 --> 00:06:35,63
people had experience before they came here.

53
00:06:35,63 --> 00:06:41,54
But by and large i think we were city people with very little experience of that extended sharing we had.

54
00:06:41,54 --> 00:06:46,72
Maybe communal households in sydney but you didn't tend to meet in really large groups of people

55
00:06:46,72 --> 00:06:53,16
and was a big part of a lot of people getting stoned together and taking mushrooms and.

56
00:06:53,16 --> 00:07:01,73
I suppose mind expansion in a sense. Before it became. Dreary and it was a real space where you could play.

57
00:07:01,73 --> 00:07:09,84
Yeah you know i could it was like. Revisiting childhood we've often talked about this and realize the value.

58
00:07:09,84 --> 00:07:17,87
There was great worth in that because we did have a we took the time we were given the time just to reconnect with all

59
00:07:17,87 --> 00:07:26,75
my friends. Over a period of months and basically we just played. We had the best firm. Even if. Yeah.

60
00:07:26,75 --> 00:07:32,9
New skills because we set up the right. We set up the craft center.

61
00:07:32,9 --> 00:07:37,35
And then on wind who worked on the offset printing press which i'd never considered before.

62
00:07:37,35 --> 00:07:47,62
You know and had a fight with mentor. Which we were paid a dollar a day which is just to print the money.

63
00:07:47,62 --> 00:07:52,74
And if you've been given to you could base everybody and now.

64
00:07:52,74 --> 00:07:59,31
I remember one day buying nothing to feed fifty thousand rice. Spread dollars. And i thought you know.

65
00:07:59,31 --> 00:08:08,87
You got a dollar a day for working on the festival. But we printed. And you know. I don't even have one. You know.

66
00:08:09,12 --> 00:08:14,85
Michael was asking. Oh i've never even heard of them.

67
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:20,23
We never even got to keep them you know i mean that's all the money we had we had no social you know this is now you're

68
00:08:20,23 --> 00:08:28,06
actually cured and we have you know i don't want to die i was really viable. And so you never got to.

69
00:08:28,06 --> 00:08:36,72
If you want yeah we did something we had a truck a big truck that we got to brisbane and bought by the market.

70
00:08:36,72 --> 00:08:41,66
So that was the convention that a number of the said with the truckie his name is harry.

71
00:08:41,66 --> 00:08:47,5
Who had grown up in an old people's home and used to tell the most amazing stories he was very old man himself and.

72
00:08:47,5 --> 00:08:50,22
He was a young man but he talked like a really old man.

73
00:08:50,22 --> 00:08:55,12
And he would talk literally from the moment you left him into the until he got to prison and all the way back.

74
00:08:55,12 --> 00:09:11,37
So we would jockey for position. And we took frightfully slow. And if you was still me time to go.

75
00:09:13,64 --> 00:09:17,99
I think one of them just died the other day a man named dudley who was a fairly old man to talk me down

76
00:09:17,99 --> 00:09:26,31
and roger the man that runs this guy i mean. Yeah no no no no no no don't look at an old man with white hair that.

77
00:09:26,31 --> 00:09:37,91
Time. I mean. Roger came after the first one hundred years in the back you know he started yeah he studied the craft.

78
00:09:37,91 --> 00:09:52,8
After scrying. So by the time the festival came around we had a stablished. Quite a strong bond between people.

79
00:09:52,8 --> 00:09:56,88
Considering how many people worked on the setting up of it i think and.

80
00:09:56,88 --> 00:10:00,63
The arguments were very minimal really that was pretty good feeling amongst them.

81
00:10:00,63 --> 00:10:05,88
Was a feeling like an extended family the bond that we lived in i guess there would have been fifteen.

82
00:10:05,88 --> 00:10:12,04
Maybe even more some of. They were little tiny piece sheds and.

83
00:10:12,04 --> 00:10:18,72
Own cow bells which we had all turned into homes and people had put up tents and things and.

84
00:10:18,72 --> 00:10:25,02
That was just one portion of it there were a lot of i sort of was it like to call the magic circle. On my.

85
00:10:25,02 --> 00:10:32,61
Given the job of sewing. A dozen i think take a piece out of canvas. For the chorus foundation which we did.

86
00:10:32,61 --> 00:10:38,97
And for doing that to keep the center. Down in the magic circle we actually moved out of this.

87
00:10:38,97 --> 00:10:46,09
Hut that we stand shooting and. So there are lots of. You know looked into. Term housing and.

88
00:10:46,09 --> 00:10:53,74
Lots of alternative healing. You know hollow tree down in the paddock down here.

89
00:10:53,74 --> 00:10:57,55
And they went they have moved away from there they're going to live in.

90
00:10:57,55 --> 00:11:01,79
And she eventually started the bath and beyond and.

91
00:11:01,79 --> 00:11:12,07
Their beginnings were as acupuncturists this holiday tree was pretty airy fairy very cosmic it much of the time you

92
00:11:12,07 --> 00:11:22,55
know it's make. Yes mostly night. And loaded. Like a risk. It will never come again.

93
00:11:23,14 --> 00:11:29,5
I mean even the children who i see in the street now who are trying to recreate it through their dress and.

94
00:11:29,5 --> 00:11:36,49
And maybe some of their ideals. I don't think it can ever be like that again because there's a certain.

95
00:11:36,49 --> 00:11:47,81
Innocence is lost in that we have game show for the children. I do it's well. I think it's great for.

96
00:11:47,81 --> 00:11:52,65
I feel at that point in our lives and. We were very optimistic.

97
00:11:52,65 --> 00:11:56,24
And there was a heart that things would get better because it was.

98
00:11:56,24 --> 00:12:01,54
As i said the flower power days and people were out i'm an optimistic that. Society would.

99
00:12:01,54 --> 00:12:07,68
As we knew it would break down and out of that would come a new order and possibly a much better attitude towards.

100
00:12:07,68 --> 00:12:25,00
Planet and towards one another as. People and. In england it's a question i want science to apes.

101
00:12:25,00 --> 00:12:29,7
I just think we're a bit slow on the uptake i'm just saying. Great need.

102
00:12:29,7 --> 00:12:33,92
Not so much now for the tourism which people have been really focusing on.

103
00:12:33,92 --> 00:12:38,84
But for the children things for the children to foxes for them and.

104
00:12:38,84 --> 00:12:47,67
Fun for them because right around advanced down the human ground and. We have a great time together.

105
00:12:47,67 --> 00:12:59,18
One hundred fifty children pass through their week. Maybe preschool. Classes ones. And that's from two used to sixteen.

106
00:12:59,18 --> 00:13:15,09
So we have time. I would say. I feel that there's a lot of. Rich a sense about celebrating aquarius.

107
00:13:15,09 --> 00:13:22,31
In a state the town is in which is sad because it's such a worry. To most of the people that live here that.

108
00:13:22,31 --> 00:13:23,8
I don't feel helpless.

109
00:13:23,8 --> 00:13:29,69
Because we basically have this tended to see tolerance as sort of like a catch phrase

110
00:13:29,69 --> 00:13:31,69
and it always has been since the days

111
00:13:31,69 --> 00:13:35,68
when we first came here because if you think about the old settlers that lived here.

112
00:13:35,68 --> 00:13:42,08
In this very quiet area and a bunch of crazy hippies with the banner hanging out their trousers literally.

113
00:13:42,08 --> 00:13:45,23
Moved in on them and i am a very tolerant of us and.

114
00:13:45,23 --> 00:13:49,02
A lot of those people have stayed and have become long time residents and.

115
00:13:49,02 --> 00:13:51,87
Have a good relationship with the old residents in the town.

116
00:13:51,87 --> 00:13:58,22
But the new young kids there or the new wave of paper that is new and with the ass hanging out of their trousers.

117
00:13:58,22 --> 00:14:08,87
Who are using drugs and selling them on the streets. Residents really out there terrified. At that and not.

118
00:14:09,01 --> 00:14:14,65
Under whether or not the streets safe and that's not nice. I mean. That's out tolerance gone haywire.

119
00:14:14,65 --> 00:14:20,43
But basically we don't know what to do about and i certainly don't know any such thing as many suggested today.

120
00:14:20,43 --> 00:14:24,62
Doesn't sound right like the police coming in dealing with it mcadam aloft and you think well.

121
00:14:24,62 --> 00:14:32,48
Where are they going to go for them. But i don't i mean i come here because of the tongue. Front. But it's.

122
00:14:32,48 --> 00:14:37,19
It's kind of turned against us really innocence which is very sad. And that's why i think it's sad.

123
00:14:37,19 --> 00:14:41,91
Altogether is that lack of. Loss of innocence because that's been the outcome of that state.

124
00:14:41,91 --> 00:14:52,5
Well again it could come back to a focus on facilities for these people if they're going to be here to do with in some

125
00:14:52,5 --> 00:14:59,41
way that helps. And. It's just cast them out further. Just gets harder and harder.

126
00:14:59,41 --> 00:15:05,34
Maybe a little creative approach to it but. Once again. You know that would take some body of.

127
00:15:05,34 --> 00:15:17,55
Responsible people to take that and funding. And from the funding. Because we're not much richer. And financially.

128
00:15:17,55 --> 00:15:30,46
Richer in spirit but still you know.

129
00:15:30,46 --> 00:15:37,1
It's still a pocket of idealism when it comes to that because i mean a lot of people ended up on communities

130
00:15:37,1 --> 00:15:42,78
and built their own homes and live fairly low cost lives yes we do. We certainly do and.

131
00:15:42,78 --> 00:15:45,69
We know lots of people like that. Yeah. And that feels great.

132
00:15:45,69 --> 00:15:51,42
And that's the way that we do with being able to settle for a much lower income.

133
00:15:51,42 --> 00:16:02,97
Is because we've got a much less costly. Wakely you know i mean it's just we've set up. That sort of lifestyle.

134
00:16:04,92 --> 00:16:24,51
So we don't draw on. Too much resource and the planet. You know it's true that when they were i have of being.

135
00:16:24,51 --> 00:16:27,44
Making breakfast in the rain one morning i was making on letts

136
00:16:27,44 --> 00:16:33,8
and a friend of mine came in with a box of a hat full of freshly picked gold tops which he then put into my own let me

137
00:16:33,8 --> 00:16:43,29
stand. Which we all i hate and we were in the process of making him graffitti or at the back. Spinning it was me me me.

138
00:16:43,29 --> 00:16:44,13
And i got him.

139
00:16:44,13 --> 00:16:52,63
I was speeding and i was so i larded i couldn't by the end of it i can be a scrap i think i'm going to go home ok.

140
00:16:52,63 --> 00:17:07,81
But i can say long you got to do but it grows. Blowing the puntland back to something. That was good for him.

141
00:17:07,81 --> 00:17:14,27
Also i remember a friend of ours who was pregnant this might just be after aquarius. And she was very pregnant and.

142
00:17:14,27 --> 00:17:20,69
She was playing in the creek down the bottom of the magic circle down the creek and she stood on a stone. Fish.

143
00:17:20,69 --> 00:17:30,27
And you know what if you know that he does pull round. And she screws rein in the sector to treat effect on.

144
00:17:30,27 --> 00:17:35,84
And she was carried by friend of mine as is about six foot three the whole length the road

145
00:17:35,84 --> 00:17:45,43
and up to ten to the hospital. Screaming headlines at one point to him her nearly had a big fat blubbery woman scream.

146
00:17:45,43 --> 00:17:53,33
Yeah that was fun remember that. I also remember. Going with a whole bunch of us in the truck.

147
00:17:53,33 --> 00:17:58,35
To a country dance right out in the middle of nowhere i wouldn't to this day know where i was.

148
00:17:58,35 --> 00:18:02,05
And it was all the old timers having abandoned said we were invited and.

149
00:18:02,05 --> 00:18:08,87
It was the most beautiful night they danced and sang dances and then gave us all scones and. He and i was just.

150
00:18:08,97 --> 00:18:12,57
Well i've never seen anything quite like it but we have actually.

151
00:18:12,57 --> 00:18:18,13
Through the connections in the past some very good friends of the older residents in the town.

152
00:18:18,13 --> 00:18:21,43
Because they weren't such a great many of us.

153
00:18:21,43 --> 00:18:32,31
At the beginning and members of the horsemen and i remember going to the rices with jewels and precious and.

154
00:18:32,31 --> 00:18:36,8
Before we went to the races we thought we better get some good clothes into something nice.

155
00:18:36,8 --> 00:18:45,84
And we found these three a match and we'd all at that point in time cut her hair off like short.

156
00:18:45,84 --> 00:18:52,54
And we all called ourselves bruce and when. Pinstripes ships.

157
00:18:53,41 --> 00:19:01,66
I just thought it was great these are always cry to introduce us to everybody in boston had the best time.

158
00:19:01,66 --> 00:19:08,44
We didn't even on the roll call bruce. That's really funny. But used to be. Music in the pub.

159
00:19:08,44 --> 00:19:12,3
In the front by the pub here and we did used to dance. We often.

160
00:19:12,3 --> 00:19:18,56
Been dry so it's kind of a uniform and they were all blotched with paint and embroider things and.

161
00:19:18,56 --> 00:19:27,46
We would dance with the local fellas and i thought that was great i thought all the christmas is coming.

162
00:19:27,46 --> 00:19:32,08
Nationally that you could have really good concerts in the town.

163
00:19:32,08 --> 00:19:40,63
Because it was the one company that was right from place to just come up with all sorts of amazing things.

164
00:19:40,63 --> 00:19:52,15
Breaking new ground in her and. So that was excellent. We still have some very nice time.

165
00:19:52,61 --> 00:20:03,66
But it was just on the part of the crazy right. The magic circle. Was just this very beautiful bend in the creek.

166
00:20:03,66 --> 00:20:11,6
And it my quarter. Like a semicircle. And then meandered on so when. Put there.

167
00:20:11,6 --> 00:20:17,59
It was like a little circle and in the center was a big. Trench for the. Cooking finance and.

168
00:20:17,59 --> 00:20:20,84
You just used the water from the creek it was just very nice place

169
00:20:20,84 --> 00:20:29,38
and of course everyone would see transplanted willingness and was just it was a magic so.

170
00:20:29,38 --> 00:20:32,87
There was a sauna down there and.

171
00:20:32,87 --> 00:20:42,88
So we would have hot sun as and then making the creek and that's when we were doing something like that.

172
00:20:42,88 --> 00:20:49,29
And again just everywhere there was music. I remember in my it was quite cold and the mists would come up.

173
00:20:49,29 --> 00:20:53,33
Because there's lots of creeks through here. At the back.

174
00:20:53,33 --> 00:20:54,45
And the miss would come off

175
00:20:54,45 --> 00:21:00,14
and you'd be stumbling because hardly anybody even owned a torch you know we didn't know you know anything much at all.

176
00:21:00,14 --> 00:21:03,74
And you'd be stumbling through the mist.

177
00:21:03,74 --> 00:21:11,57
Just missing the creek or falling over somebody would fall and how it was very funny. And you coming to these.

178
00:21:11,57 --> 00:21:16,84
Tense situations or just you know however people had saved up some sort of shelter.

179
00:21:16,84 --> 00:21:21,17
And little tiny lights and then you discover all the faces and maybe music happening

180
00:21:21,17 --> 00:21:30,00
and i remember there was one lovely one over there and that guy was there who had made all these musical instruments.

181
00:21:30,00 --> 00:21:36,79
The craziest musical instruments you know where you sort of have to stretch the necks of things. And wonderful.

182
00:21:36,79 --> 00:21:43,55
That was one of the best places to go out knife. It was really fun.

183
00:21:43,55 --> 00:21:54,86
So the first record stayed on for us and after a short period of time and then i went to northern queensland. Yeah.

184
00:21:54,86 --> 00:22:08,87
That we started to help the club. I started to log a stall so my friend joel was having a baby. He was born in july.

185
00:22:10,53 --> 00:22:29,52
She was for me and. We waited until. Big enough to travel back to queensland. When you returned.

186
00:22:29,52 --> 00:22:44,77
About sixteen years ago. Maybe fifteen years ago. And i had been living in tunisia and. America and japan and.

187
00:22:44,77 --> 00:22:49,75
I came back to a strange you know wanting to settle and have children and.

188
00:22:49,75 --> 00:22:55,83
The only place i thought that was going was named because the midwife who i spoke about that lived in the hollow tree.

189
00:22:55,83 --> 00:22:58,95
Had since become a midwife and i knew that's what i wanted to do.

190
00:22:58,95 --> 00:23:06,23
So i came back and headed straight for naman and they were friends of mine and we lived in and. One of the original.

191
00:23:06,23 --> 00:23:09,73
Five houses in newman. I don't know how rich smith road.

192
00:23:09,73 --> 00:23:16,89
Belonged to one of the original settlers and in many areas the most magnificent old scow and we came back.

193
00:23:16,89 --> 00:23:25,67
And i taught about a coyote and about take studio for the. Very fast since then i go.

194
00:23:25,67 --> 00:23:44,04
Every now and again they are just children children and. To microsoft you know we built a house.

195
00:23:44,04 --> 00:23:53,25
We live in the community. So.

196
00:23:53,25 --> 00:23:54,9
I think my husband

197
00:23:54,9 --> 00:24:01,66
and i lived in about seven places around in a number of them one of them was on a community with graeme dunstan

198
00:24:01,66 --> 00:24:04,63
and at the time his wife died. And their children.

199
00:24:04,63 --> 00:24:09,82
So that was the early days when people were beginning to have their babies at home there was a very. Being.

200
00:24:09,82 --> 00:24:16,81
Well once again i think that idealist. Attitude towards. Having babies at home building homes.

201
00:24:16,81 --> 00:24:21,9
Going veggie gardens and orchards. That was very viable thing to do.

202
00:24:21,9 --> 00:24:28,21
And i think there was something like two hundred babies born in the area that we would often attend one another's

203
00:24:28,21 --> 00:24:34,17
births sometimes i would go with carol. Climbing mountains in the middle of the night as her birthing assistance.

204
00:24:34,17 --> 00:24:39,28
There was a still even in those days who was most fantastic failing in this town. We had it.

205
00:24:39,28 --> 00:24:44,72
A folk club that people would come from far and wide to be a paddle. And it was just wonderful.

206
00:24:44,72 --> 00:24:50,36
Because to dollar to get in and people who you wouldn't even know where performance would get up

207
00:24:50,36 --> 00:24:54,74
and just surprise you with my spew. Is really good fun.

208
00:24:54,74 --> 00:25:00,64
And even in those days i think it was still very hard to get sense of social security so there was a lot of sharing

209
00:25:00,64 --> 00:25:08,94
people would share. You know they was. There was a lot of sharing. That took place.

210
00:25:12,86 --> 00:25:18,32
Well the start of the hunger movement. Carol elliott who was a trained acupuncturist.

211
00:25:18,32 --> 00:25:20,77
And very interested in homeopathy.

212
00:25:20,77 --> 00:25:30,07
Who had had four children has so i think she's since a qualified midwife and she went to london

213
00:25:30,07 --> 00:25:33,81
and got her qualifications but at the time she was and i midwife.

214
00:25:33,81 --> 00:25:37,53
And she would go to people whose place is very inaccessible.

215
00:25:37,53 --> 00:25:41,83
Like i mean i remember one birth she went to right at the end of the guard's valley.

216
00:25:41,83 --> 00:25:48,94
And it was during a whip season and the lady couldn't get out. And so carolyn. And then norman waded the creek and.

217
00:25:48,94 --> 00:25:55,68
It was one of those extended labors and so basically they would just go to people's homes and i would set up camp and.

218
00:25:55,68 --> 00:26:02,29
Sometimes i'd be there for days and. You know people would have their babies the way they wanted to.

219
00:26:02,29 --> 00:26:09,63
Which was very soft lighting. Ambience that you weren't harried. My first child was born. That it.

220
00:26:09,63 --> 00:26:16,42
Explained in the fam has a carolyn moment and i lived in the labor was very easy. Six hours.

221
00:26:16,42 --> 00:26:19,54
I had people sitting in the room meditating. He was born in the us.

222
00:26:19,54 --> 00:26:25,09
Well it blighted started in the early hours of the morning his phone and lunchtime and it was just.

223
00:26:25,09 --> 00:26:28,48
No hurry nobody has identity lot of reading

224
00:26:28,48 --> 00:26:33,46
and i think that was the thing most women who had had their babies in harm really took responsibility for educating

225
00:26:33,46 --> 00:26:35,67
themselves about the purses so.

226
00:26:35,67 --> 00:26:41,09
Even i didn't know what to expect i basically knew what was going to happen and carol's very telepathic woman.

227
00:26:41,09 --> 00:26:49,34
She would just do it here. And she would just read you. And you know what next. Yeah.

228
00:26:49,34 --> 00:26:54,33
Thank you again you know why pendulum of your family to see where you were at at what stage in your life over

229
00:26:54,33 --> 00:27:00,91
and you know she give you some homeopathic said she would basically just talk about and do what she had to do and.

230
00:27:00,91 --> 00:27:05,99
When the birth was over you don't drink champagne and. A chocolate cake or fruit cake was a favorite.

231
00:27:05,99 --> 00:27:15,23
Had to beg for her but she did in fact deliver. Many of the children that people. Gave names to like rain forest and.

232
00:27:15,23 --> 00:27:24,55
Softly saw my sensical just seeing right. And very beautiful children and in those days.

233
00:27:24,55 --> 00:27:31,22
Everyone was having babies that was a really big baby boom here and so there was a lot of communal living and.

234
00:27:31,22 --> 00:27:42,36
With small children and we would start play groups together and. Bicyclists share as much or.

235
00:27:42,36 --> 00:27:45,33
Well she worked on a donation basis and.

236
00:27:45,33 --> 00:27:50,8
Unfortunately that's where things really went wrong i feel because she was often people would come from a long way away

237
00:27:50,8 --> 00:27:54,06
to have their baby and i would end up staying with carolyn and.

238
00:27:54,06 --> 00:28:00,05
They wouldn't have much in the way of money so that either pay her with cabbages or. You know about a something and.

239
00:28:00,05 --> 00:28:03,81
They eventually got to the point where carolyn and we couldn't live like that anymore.

240
00:28:03,81 --> 00:28:08,87
And after having that happen to them for years on end. They felt that they she didn't have to.

241
00:28:09,01 --> 00:28:16,32
No it had to be on the dole. Doing what they were doing. And in any other place they wouldn't have had that. Abuse.

242
00:28:16,32 --> 00:28:21,3
Unfortunately it did become difficult for them. So they ended up going to live in london and.

243
00:28:21,3 --> 00:28:36,88
Can very well known very famous it. Has meant a lot of money. But it was done on about a system really. I think.

244
00:28:36,88 --> 00:28:47,56
Well that's right. You know it's going to be the best in best my second child i think it was a room.

245
00:28:48,81 --> 00:28:56,23
Maybe it's because this room here which is what twelve. By ten and. There were eighteen people five somewhat children.

246
00:28:56,23 --> 00:29:00,23
My eldest son jesse was a birth attendant he looked.

247
00:29:00,23 --> 00:29:04,69
I mean he couldn't get any closer he gave a running commentary like. Yak money.

248
00:29:04,69 --> 00:29:08,52
Yeah yeah yeah everybody in fits of laughter.

249
00:29:08,52 --> 00:29:10,02
And my brother and i took photos

250
00:29:10,02 --> 00:29:15,56
and he would have been right maybe almost between my legs i mean he got the most explicit birth notice.

251
00:29:15,56 --> 00:29:18,52
And i didn't even notice him. There were people everywhere.

252
00:29:18,52 --> 00:29:21,64
And it was just you know as you say it's like birth planning.

253
00:29:21,64 --> 00:29:25,82
But it was so personal and so intense that it really didn't matter.

254
00:29:25,82 --> 00:29:31,31
And each and every one of those people has a connection with my children unless they've got to be present.

255
00:29:32,06 --> 00:29:44,03
We just had a birth recently on the broad. Most recent and. Marilyn's eldest son. Fifteen and.

256
00:29:44,03 --> 00:29:52,77
It's about this baby kind of sitting at the bottom of the bit saying this is not my mother's best feature.

257
00:29:52,77 --> 00:29:55,33
There are things like that room again.

258
00:29:55,33 --> 00:30:01,73
You know like it's so you just get drawn there you know you think you need these people will come

259
00:30:01,73 --> 00:30:08,87
but they hadn't has the baby come you know. You know on the energy.

260
00:30:09,53 --> 00:30:19,96
That you can't do that but i think it was the home with so many circle around. And quite a few.

261
00:30:19,96 --> 00:30:27,4
Yes all the kids who went to school the next stage. Personal development class and said.

262
00:30:27,4 --> 00:30:40,28
Experience best personal development we've ever had you had a baby. Yeah. It's one.

263
00:30:40,28 --> 00:30:43,52
And then we would have blessing ceremonies there was one absolutely beautiful

264
00:30:43,52 --> 00:30:46,72
when we were on fact there's been many of them when max.

265
00:30:46,72 --> 00:30:51,97
Visited this area because that's another thing that people a lot of people around this area into meditation of some

266
00:30:51,97 --> 00:30:59,91
sort and so we get. Incredible visits from very high. Spiritual beings and on a couple of occasions we've had them. Do.

267
00:30:59,91 --> 00:31:04,19
Naming ceremonies for children with people from farm wod would bring their babies and.

268
00:31:04,19 --> 00:31:09,32
They would be given a spiritual name and then there'd be a celebration and a blessing and a very beautiful.

269
00:31:16,23 --> 00:31:25,06
Let me tell you that night at the post office and you know. I remember mr smith.

270
00:31:25,06 --> 00:31:29,92
Mr smith who used to run the post office and him and he was a saint he was ready for a time

271
00:31:29,92 --> 00:31:35,28
and so he figured he would buy himself the smallest postoffice he could find and retired to.
