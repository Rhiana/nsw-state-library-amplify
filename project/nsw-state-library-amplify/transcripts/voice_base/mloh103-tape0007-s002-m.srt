1
00:00:10,64 --> 00:00:22,51
The classic head in is in the name then is not the head an ism of new york or london or paris cairo. Wherever.

2
00:00:22,51 --> 00:00:38,24
But full moon nights and the fruits of on. Delicious for use. I mean. The feast right. Healthy living.

3
00:00:38,24 --> 00:00:42,6
Beautifully prepared and presented. Vegetarian.

4
00:00:42,6 --> 00:00:55,05
Back when one talks of two food and and learned who was as being the food of a non-meat eating culture.

5
00:00:55,05 --> 00:01:11,07
And i can assure you that. We ate well. Me. Home brew and herbal teas. Herbal teas is said to a tingle and.

6
00:01:11,07 --> 00:01:15,41
And of course the duck smoking and that. And the mushrooms and things and.

7
00:01:15,41 --> 00:01:26,5
And certainly in the early days of nimbin that was about that the sum total of any drug taking that.

8
00:01:26,5 --> 00:01:35,52
That that i was aware of and. And i will say this that i grew up. Or i lived in nimbin. For those seventeen knees.

9
00:01:35,52 --> 00:01:46,35
I have lived in those and i. And i was a non smoker. I was you know. To to actually still be amongst some fairly.

10
00:01:46,35 --> 00:01:52,15
Entrenched marijuana users and. I'm not to be a smoker was quite threatening.

11
00:01:54,39 --> 00:02:05,84
I was just allergic to dust and you can get your highs in many many ways. You know that the dancing the blue knob.

12
00:02:06,57 --> 00:02:14,59
And the. And the dances that we used to have a blue note who just had to be experienced.

13
00:02:14,59 --> 00:02:19,55
New year's eve in blue no hole was particularly fat. Fabulous and. The year that.

14
00:02:19,55 --> 00:02:26,75
I like i don't know what you had john. John and sue fox came with welfare state international.

15
00:02:26,75 --> 00:02:38,48
But we built the giant and had the lanterns and that. And the bonfire. It was. It was wonderful.

16
00:02:38,48 --> 00:02:50,59
And that was something that's come of nimbleness is is the celebrations. The sharings both in birth and in death.

17
00:02:50,59 --> 00:03:02,76
We've had our deaths in nimbin. With children and other adults and. And even. Last year almost exactly a year ago.

18
00:03:02,76 --> 00:03:16,61
John and sue folks came to visit to us here in in lismore and. My father had died. The day before they arrived and.

19
00:03:16,61 --> 00:03:24,52
They helped me prepare a celebration of his passing. Which we held here in the garden.

20
00:03:24,52 --> 00:03:26,14
And that was just beautiful and it was.

21
00:03:26,14 --> 00:03:35,41
It was moving on from that the rituals and ceremonies that we've had in my children know.

22
00:03:35,41 --> 00:03:44,41
When that i'm in the naming ceremony. So. Ritual celebration.

23
00:03:44,41 --> 00:03:53,66
May be had in this in head in this it is a hard one it's just delightful. To light food. Delights and earthly delights.

24
00:03:53,66 --> 00:04:04,87
Is how i remember it. And i suppose for perhaps being in the in the mama role. It was my life was somewhat.

25
00:04:04,87 --> 00:04:15,56
Tempered by that. Didn't stop me from dancing like. My pregnant belly off night after night but.

26
00:04:15,56 --> 00:04:30,66
You can see why don't the format. This amazing mess. This. Oh this. And then free and friendship tiny.

27
00:04:30,66 --> 00:04:53,46
And suddenly and i knew rada indian names of which in all names. South american names. All sorts of things.

28
00:04:53,46 --> 00:05:09,31
Ploughs trees. Sita amazing things. I can't remember the name.

29
00:05:11,2 --> 00:05:24,6
The idea of naming the names of the children or finding the names of the children. Was again. Relating to how.

30
00:05:24,6 --> 00:05:29,37
How we felt about where we were and.

31
00:05:29,37 --> 00:05:40,05
Perhaps rejection of the susans in the dark jonson the dieted less and less so and finding names that had meaning.

32
00:05:40,05 --> 00:05:50,78
Many children would name to because of the then meaning of that. That nags. Because there was a strong. Indian tibetan.

33
00:05:50,78 --> 00:06:00,92
American indian influence on the spirituality of the people so that people had you know he taught name still or.

34
00:06:00,92 --> 00:06:08,06
Would his name so south american names. The environmental movement lead. Two children having.

35
00:06:08,06 --> 00:06:17,81
Names of trees and and and animals. So perhaps being.

36
00:06:17,81 --> 00:06:26,81
Being interested in reclaiming different cultures and searching for culture. I think that we. We took him.

37
00:06:26,81 --> 00:06:37,1
Tested out and checked out. All the other cultures that were not. The western white protestant ethic. Anything but.

38
00:06:37,1 --> 00:06:47,91
So you know people. There was the south america there was the american indian there was the the. The indian.

39
00:06:47,91 --> 00:06:49,19
Tibetan buddhist.

40
00:06:49,19 --> 00:06:54,66
All sorts of different cultures which were were examined in looked at and bits were taken from him

41
00:06:54,66 --> 00:07:14,95
but so taken to hear that from that that that. Went up to build that. The culture has developed in this area now.

42
00:07:14,95 --> 00:07:17,71
Oh yes. Yes. Again.

43
00:07:17,71 --> 00:07:23,27
From the sublime to the ridiculous you can only it's like what i was saying before about having to go all the way.

44
00:07:23,27 --> 00:07:25,5
I mean what if you look at these sort of.

45
00:07:25,5 --> 00:07:31,19
You go to some of these conferences and things that they have now these search conferences and. You know that.

46
00:07:31,19 --> 00:07:36,21
The big multinationals and. And the banks and the government and even the public service have now.

47
00:07:36,21 --> 00:07:45,22
And you have to have brainstorms. You know. And in the brainstorms i say. The wildest ideas you've got.

48
00:07:45,22 --> 00:07:47,02
You know all these people who get paid thousands

49
00:07:47,02 --> 00:07:51,2
and thousands of dollars for doing these things these consultancies you know.

50
00:07:51,2 --> 00:07:56,09
Letting go and you know just let your minds go free. And i have the wildest ideas.

51
00:07:56,09 --> 00:07:59,53
And then from there we can find something is only if you let your mind go free

52
00:07:59,53 --> 00:08:05,84
and you let you go to the ultimate that you get something. Solutions some alternative side to use. In the lived it.

53
00:08:06,19 --> 00:08:13,93
You know. This. Well you conferences in your career consultancy. Member lived. Doing that. Things like.

54
00:08:13,93 --> 00:08:18,96
You know we we are allowed to to push the limits you know.

55
00:08:18,96 --> 00:08:24,18
Because it's an about pushing the limits that you actually find something otherwise you live in mediocrity if you.

56
00:08:24,18 --> 00:08:26,91
You know it's sort of like. If you don't.

57
00:08:26,91 --> 00:08:34,78
If you've got to go out a little bit further you're not going to see the value of goods.

58
00:08:34,78 --> 00:08:59,12
So i can't think of any five words i mean. Twenty dozy reckoned her. Hadn't thought about. Funny nimbin story.

59
00:08:59,12 --> 00:09:09,61
Some of the houses..

60
00:09:00,94 --> 00:09:10,77
I mean when you're talking about pushing the limits it's some of the houses that people go to know from from t.p.s. To.

61
00:09:10,77 --> 00:09:22,18
Two houses made out of aluminum plates from from printers. Recycling.

62
00:09:22,18 --> 00:09:27,42
You know just the amazing things that people could do with recycling.

63
00:09:27,42 --> 00:09:36,83
Peter pedals and his and his bicycle technology you know. The idea of of of. You know. Making smoothies.

64
00:09:36,83 --> 00:09:51,49
On a bicycle pedal power. Those stairs things. Then can be refined intend into to really usable things people.

65
00:09:51,49 --> 00:09:54,59
There was that there was a guy who used to go around the streets and.

66
00:09:54,59 --> 00:10:03,47
And wearing dresses and hats from st vinnies and made. Made. Puppets from from twigs and. I can't remember his name.

67
00:10:03,47 --> 00:10:11,85
I mean he was he was eccentric campus up and he. Was he told. Wonderful stories and made people laugh.

68
00:10:11,85 --> 00:10:20,48
And allow that space for the telling the stories. The community. You know. Just just.

69
00:10:20,48 --> 00:10:26,37
Oh you can't have all these people from all these different groups and things coming together and living.

70
00:10:26,37 --> 00:10:40,17
Successful in people who've done it to go. I meet. I'm an aries and so. One of the attributes of an aries is.

71
00:10:40,17 --> 00:10:49,09
Is to be pioneering. To be in on the ground floor of things and. That was what i was. I was.

72
00:10:49,09 --> 00:10:54,49
I did a lot and then been sacked from the game to. This what i did a lot and then been.

73
00:10:55,17 --> 00:11:01,53
And was involved in the setting up of a number of the community groups that.

74
00:11:01,53 --> 00:11:06,67
Organizations activities that is still happening. We talked about birth and beyond.

75
00:11:06,67 --> 00:11:15,6
And i was involved in that and it's very early days. I was involved in the home builders association. In my.

76
00:11:15,6 --> 00:11:21,71
My female capacity. In the community school.

77
00:11:21,71 --> 00:11:31,13
I was in my my children were some of the first hurston children to go to the community school and was.

78
00:11:31,13 --> 00:11:35,3
Was involved in the various committees. That we set up to to get that going.

79
00:11:37,27 --> 00:11:47,58
The co-anchor preschool which isn't nimbin but still run on in the same sort of. Lines. And. Yes.

80
00:11:47,58 --> 00:11:50,85
So a lot of the things that went on there i i like to be.

81
00:11:50,85 --> 00:11:58,15
I was involved in like think that i was there in the early days.

82
00:11:58,15 --> 00:12:05,84
I've been i helped boot who has is the first house was on. Was on. Shad land.

83
00:12:06,06 --> 00:12:14,23
That little iraq with some difference eddie and elspeth. Who i first met in katmandu.

84
00:12:14,23 --> 00:12:20,23
All the world mates and then been to. And. Marcus and i built that house together.

85
00:12:22,01 --> 00:12:26,59
And it was made entirely of recycled materials.

86
00:12:27,95 --> 00:12:38,26
And was very beautiful and mad ideas like we used the poles were made from. Dead trees and.

87
00:12:38,26 --> 00:12:43,21
We thought that because the dead trees had all been eaten up by white hats that we wouldn't have any problems with

88
00:12:43,21 --> 00:12:48,39
white tents so we built the house with poles straight into the ground not wanting to use chemicals

89
00:12:48,39 --> 00:12:51,94
or the like i'm the white hence thought this was just wonderful

90
00:12:51,94 --> 00:12:58,92
and so they used this is that channels to got to to build up and and heavy on the base of the house and.

91
00:12:58,92 --> 00:13:05,31
Eventually sort of. Went back to the yeah. It was a biodegradable hass.

92
00:13:07,7 --> 00:13:13,36
And it was exquisite it was just like hansel and gretel house. Covered in violence and.

93
00:13:13,36 --> 00:13:28,78
My babies grow up that it was beautiful. And the other house that i built was. He's my own title.

94
00:13:28,78 --> 00:13:35,27
In a village in a community. Environment that and that house i designed.

95
00:13:35,27 --> 00:13:44,38
I did all the convincing when i purchased the land i did that myself. I designed it i did the plans.

96
00:13:44,38 --> 00:13:50,35
I hired the services of a builder to do a lot of the work and.

97
00:13:50,35 --> 00:13:53,2
Every morning before i went to work in the public service.

98
00:13:53,2 --> 00:13:57,27
I used to get up at six o'clock and work on the house for two hours.

99
00:13:57,27 --> 00:14:05,84
And then go to work and then come home in the evenings and work on it again. So. Yeah i built. I built.

100
00:14:06,01 --> 00:14:14,19
A lot of that hastert and other people came and helped as well and we had with king basin. And it was lovely.

101
00:14:14,19 --> 00:14:31,32
You would guess what. The challenge is for for the area. Is to find creative.

102
00:14:31,32 --> 00:14:43,81
Responses to the unemployment program problem. The challenge is to not be overwhelmed by despair.

103
00:14:43,81 --> 00:14:57,03
The challenge is to maintain hot for me. Is to maintain hot. You know bureaucracy which is fairly hot less.

104
00:14:57,03 --> 00:15:09,63
So we have very very high unemployment here and. I see that is a possibility with creative.

105
00:15:09,63 --> 00:15:18,59
Responses to that situation to. Again. Keep the spirit of aquarius going i'm finding new ways of doing things and.

106
00:15:18,59 --> 00:15:28,03
And the department is is responding. I've been involved in the training and employment of people in.

107
00:15:28,03 --> 00:15:40,1
Rebirthing yoga training in. Pema culture. In organic farming. There are people making.

108
00:15:40,1 --> 00:15:54,87
Training and setting up an incubator. Business in recycled and. Sound to events to make finishing. Hopefully.

109
00:15:54,87 --> 00:16:09,19
Enterprises like the ramp up our company will. Will grow. In other areas too. So yeah it's. And it's also being.

110
00:16:09,19 --> 00:16:18,3
Being a sort of a media. A mediator between. The bureaucracies.

111
00:16:18,3 --> 00:16:24,37
Which are struggling to come to terms with the idea of the alternative lifestyles and they

112
00:16:24,37 --> 00:16:33,69
and other people in this area too. And they say. And the unemployment problem. Situation. Maybe unemployment.

113
00:16:33,69 --> 00:16:45,94
Can be turned into something other than a problem for you or you. I'm i'm struggling against the use of the.

114
00:16:45,94 --> 00:16:59,59
Of the word hope. Because it kind of smacks of. No hope. So my. My vision. My. My optimism. For women.

115
00:16:59,59 --> 00:17:16,03
Is that it will go on learning from it six. Our experience that that that nimbin. Is not seen as just being limpin.

116
00:17:16,03 --> 00:17:25,86
But is more than. The name and so is the nimbin village in the nimbin community. And then. Aquarius goes beyond that.

117
00:17:25,86 --> 00:17:36,9
That the children that have grown up in and around women will be able to hold in their hearts. And they will.

118
00:17:36,9 --> 00:17:44,17
They will. They will always have that. Even if they. They set aside for a time.

119
00:17:44,17 --> 00:17:49,58
They will always have the name been experienced and they've been growing in their hearts

120
00:17:49,58 --> 00:17:55,39
and they will always be very special and very different. As a result. So that.

121
00:17:55,39 --> 00:18:07,48
That nimbin will will grow up that nimbin will be able to to move into the twenty first. Century.

122
00:18:07,48 --> 00:18:19,5
With the best of what we've learned. And to deal in a compassionate and heart. Filled way. With the problems.

123
00:18:19,5 --> 00:18:32,04
And to acknowledge to satisfy. But to to grab. It's my pleasure. When i saw.
