1
00:00:10,46 --> 00:00:20,25
Challenges yes. Challenges from them and there was a time. I think it was perhaps five six maybe even seven years ago.

2
00:00:20,25 --> 00:00:27,7
It appeared that the. The whole spec scene was getting at of control in the streets of newman again. And then that.

3
00:00:27,7 --> 00:00:33,51
It seemed to go through a period of easing off i don't know if economic conditions in the outside world have been who

4
00:00:33,51 --> 00:00:38,99
with the. Fluctuating number of junkies that seem to come to town.

5
00:00:38,99 --> 00:00:43,56
It appears from what i've heard to be going to another. Upswing. Rotten there.

6
00:00:43,98 --> 00:00:53,08
I mean it's obviously a shame for the people who work in them and the shanta people who go on the smack to you know.

7
00:00:53,08 --> 00:01:01,21
This i for one. But i don't think that it's anything that will drag the town under. And so the town the killing.

8
00:01:01,21 --> 00:01:06,33
Because the town is just like a visual. Manifestation of a lot larger.

9
00:01:06,33 --> 00:01:11,93
Core of people you know and there are thousands of people you never see illustrated down to that or atma hills

10
00:01:11,93 --> 00:01:19,69
or perhaps they're chopping them in because i don't like the in-town feeling. But this story.

11
00:01:19,69 --> 00:01:25,86
I don't i can't see any real challenges that newman can't. Succumb.

12
00:01:25,86 --> 00:01:30,43
I think the tourist challenge is perhaps the biggest one we've faced year in a lot of ways

13
00:01:30,43 --> 00:01:37,42
and a lot of people feel very strongly about it. You know very anti tourist. Don't come staring at us.

14
00:01:37,42 --> 00:01:42,46
There then we're just living our life piss off. I don't want a few tourists.

15
00:01:43,98 --> 00:01:52,88
That's what we have we go overseas and challenges our council you know thing that. That's going to bring us down.

16
00:01:52,88 --> 00:02:08,46
It will just go from strength to strength. Take over the world. Niman today. Tomorrow. The universe. To pleasure. Ok.

17
00:02:09,34 --> 00:02:22,35
Mama. Fun celebration. Bob bob is. The one that really sticks in my mind. Was the house warming party. That we have.

18
00:02:22,35 --> 00:02:32,78
When we've finished building our house daughter and myself. And we'd planned it a hassle of.

19
00:02:32,78 --> 00:02:36,03
At least six months before it happened and.

20
00:02:36,03 --> 00:02:41,84
Had a very optimistic attitude as to how long it would take us to build this house that we were building.

21
00:02:41,84 --> 00:02:43,57
Having never will that hammer

22
00:02:43,57 --> 00:02:52,03
and sold you for my life i didn't need tools were like i had a boy my first heaven saw when i wanted to build a house.

23
00:02:52,03 --> 00:02:55,59
And we do it his house we've had.

24
00:02:55,59 --> 00:03:01,62
I feel a little bit of a problem with the council in terms of forgetting to contact them first about it.

25
00:03:01,62 --> 00:03:09,66
And he issued us with stuff work notices and the. Weeks before the party was due. But when it eventually i did.

26
00:03:09,66 --> 00:03:18,47
The they had we'd moved into the house. Twenty four hours before the party and. You had no furniture.

27
00:03:18,47 --> 00:03:27,1
Had nothing in the house at all and maybe one hundred fifty people turned up. Out in the middle of nowhere.

28
00:03:27,1 --> 00:03:31,08
Like to me it seemed like it was right in the middle of the bush.

29
00:03:31,08 --> 00:03:37,77
There was no at the houses you could see for this far as the arkansas. And there were all these people in my house and.

30
00:03:37,77 --> 00:03:49,2
Everybody had brought a cushion. And it was just wonderful it went from bad to dies and. Stuck in my mind.

31
00:03:49,2 --> 00:03:57,84
And stuck right there in this image of this wonderful party was his close friend of mine who'd just got out of hospital.

32
00:03:57,84 --> 00:04:02,7
Two days before after being in traction for six months with a broken hip. From a car accident.

33
00:04:03,23 --> 00:04:10,34
And he sat in the one arm chair that we had that somebody had brought an arm chair for him and he. Sat in his chair.

34
00:04:10,34 --> 00:04:21,72
All. All not nice the next day with a big small in size. And it was just wonderful. Doner admired some rather.

35
00:04:21,72 --> 00:04:39,15
Overly strong. Cookies and everybody had a really wonderful time on. So you know what. So. Oh yes.

36
00:04:39,15 --> 00:04:46,72
A lot of a good party i think is the common thread and. The the bonding. That people get.

37
00:04:46,72 --> 00:04:55,41
When you have a really big happy successful celebration. Together you know. It's the old some is greater than the.

38
00:04:55,41 --> 00:04:58,6
Or that the whole is greater than some other parts of australia.

39
00:04:58,6 --> 00:05:04,49
Is that when there's a group get together to celebrate and. It's a good.

40
00:05:04,49 --> 00:05:11,37
Working celebration it seems to achieve something. That that feeling of unity.

41
00:05:11,37 --> 00:05:19,55
I think that a lot of people need to continually reassess and reestablish that feeling of unity with the.

42
00:05:19,55 --> 00:05:21,22
Kindred spirits.

43
00:05:21,22 --> 00:05:26,75
I think that's perhaps one of the bonding forces in the area is that feeling of kindred in this between the people who

44
00:05:26,75 --> 00:05:35,41
are here. Hi i'm jill. Jill giant.

45
00:05:36,11 --> 00:05:43,25
And i came here in a she went away for a couple of years and then came back to live permanently and i d.

46
00:05:43,25 --> 00:05:47,28
To think it was when my son was old enough to go to school.

47
00:05:47,28 --> 00:05:56,99
He needed a bit of the bison before that i was a travelling hippie. And now i've found.

48
00:05:56,99 --> 00:06:00,57
After living in the bush and having babies in their living houses.

49
00:06:00,57 --> 00:06:03,61
Which i'd love to do and growing vegetables and all that it's.

50
00:06:04,21 --> 00:06:10,62
Now i've needed something a bit more creative to find meaning in. Life with your life.

51
00:06:11,32 --> 00:06:18,31
So are established a fabric painting. Business which. I really love to do.

52
00:06:18,93 --> 00:06:26,28
And it's brought me closer to a lot of people and i've been i would share my skills with a lot of people

53
00:06:26,28 --> 00:06:29,63
and then been get some of the kids a bit more inspired

54
00:06:29,63 --> 00:06:37,49
and guided into doing something creative which makes them feel really good about and.

55
00:06:37,49 --> 00:06:40,58
I got a great shed that i working from home.

56
00:06:40,58 --> 00:06:44,75
Which is very lucky i'm one of the few houses here that's got mine's power.

57
00:06:45,61 --> 00:06:51,79
So i couldn't do it otherwise it's on the lockers and that sort of thing. And.

58
00:06:51,79 --> 00:06:54,63
And it attracts a lot of people here on to the community.

59
00:06:54,63 --> 00:07:00,7
Of diverse people i've had a woman from the gold coast in fact yesterday i came down who's interested in mocking some

60
00:07:00,7 --> 00:07:10,6
of the. And it's really interesting too. To have a focal point like that to attract all these are different people and.

61
00:07:10,6 --> 00:07:17,86
That's a good mating point. And it's also good for the. You know the broader area to have a bit of an economy.

62
00:07:17,86 --> 00:07:23,72
You know and. You know being out to generate money and also the tourists coming into the area they're always.

63
00:07:23,72 --> 00:07:27,6
All wanting something unusual to take a while with them and there's very few things.

64
00:07:27,6 --> 00:07:32,43
All this getting more and more products in the shops for people to buy and take away.

65
00:07:32,68 --> 00:07:49,73
So that's a big part of it as well. As scrooge where we live. Yeah. Living in the bush i mean.

66
00:07:49,73 --> 00:07:53,43
You just look at the wind. It's just inspiring. This.

67
00:07:53,43 --> 00:08:00,74
And it's all so new in this so much diversity in patterns and colors. Within the people the environment.

68
00:08:00,74 --> 00:08:03,46
The conversations that you have it's all.

69
00:08:03,46 --> 00:08:04,8
Feeding you constantly off

70
00:08:04,8 --> 00:08:09,42
and sort of move back to the city i don't think i could be as creative because it's sort of it's.

71
00:08:09,64 --> 00:08:14,12
You know i think whereas here. The bush and.

72
00:08:14,12 --> 00:08:21,26
There's always different ideas and different color schemes you know in a way into the blue collars

73
00:08:21,26 --> 00:08:29,01
and sunny diets already in orange and yellow. Yeah.

74
00:08:33,63 --> 00:08:42,31
So yeah i came here with a three year old for the city because we lived. When i lived in new zealand we didn't have.

75
00:08:42,31 --> 00:08:46,23
We didn't believe in any money we live totally.

76
00:08:46,23 --> 00:08:52,42
Sustainably we used to pick mussels off the rocks and sell them and sex once a month we had a bow.

77
00:08:52,42 --> 00:08:59,53
And with the money we made from that we bought six of ross six of waste and six of sugar. And we used to fish.

78
00:08:59,53 --> 00:09:08,00
In those walpole. And those cry fish. And we had an incredibly abundant life from the land all. That's all we. We used.

79
00:09:08,2 --> 00:09:09,73
What was around us.

80
00:09:09,73 --> 00:09:09,91
And

81
00:09:09,91 --> 00:09:15,92
when i first came to nimbin from new zealand i couldn't believe coming to nimbin gee nobody had fish to balls in the ground

82
00:09:15,92 --> 00:09:20,69
like i thought they were just playing it being able to manage it you know how.

83
00:09:20,69 --> 00:09:25,75
And it took me a while to get used to that but i mean you're straddling government and it's magnanimity.

84
00:09:25,75 --> 00:09:32,78
What it is the word is just paid us to live here in paradise shall i thought well well that's ok thank you very much.

85
00:09:32,78 --> 00:09:36,8
And now i can get into other things apart from growing vegetables and.

86
00:09:36,8 --> 00:09:39,89
You know doing the basics and i think we've been very very lucky.

87
00:09:39,89 --> 00:09:43,43
For years and i don't know how long it's going to continue.

88
00:09:43,73 --> 00:09:47,11
But i think it's something that we've all got to look at that it's not going to keep going for ever

89
00:09:47,11 --> 00:09:53,16
and we do have to create another economic sort of bice at this number and this area can sustain itself

90
00:09:53,16 --> 00:10:01,96
and that's one of the challenges i guess that i can see from them been creating a different economy based not on what

91
00:10:01,96 --> 00:10:09,42
mine strains by storm but more. Bball in the sense of like you know the whole permit culture thing.

92
00:10:09,47 --> 00:10:13,74
On the whole getting vegetable. Thing.

93
00:10:13,74 --> 00:10:18,15
And with the says a lot of tourists and a lot of visitors coming to the town that.

94
00:10:18,15 --> 00:10:23,18
You know that really wants things and they gonna lie still with money in their pockets and empty and.

95
00:10:23,18 --> 00:10:28,53
You know there's a very there's a really big market in there that has to be that would be good to tap into.

96
00:10:28,53 --> 00:10:38,63
And a positive i think is possible. Now because of avalos very high.

97
00:10:38,63 --> 00:10:42,91
That's what i found in new zealand for three years survival was number one and you didn't have time.

98
00:10:43,59 --> 00:10:46,18
I mean we had a beautiful. We had.

99
00:10:46,18 --> 00:10:52,26
You know a lot stalls fantastic what we ate what we talked about the music we had and all that but.

100
00:10:52,26 --> 00:10:54,41
It was very much of a struggle.

101
00:10:54,41 --> 00:10:59,8
You know twenty four hours a diver chile you were working all the time whereas i think the dolls given us the freedom

102
00:10:59,8 --> 00:11:06,1
to. Well build comfortable houses and giving us the time to go off and.

103
00:11:06,1 --> 00:11:19,33
You know create more interesting things to do rather than just the toil of a happy doll bludgers.

104
00:11:19,33 --> 00:11:27,57
The last say if you delve less i see it as a rural subsidy. And i see a lot of people.

105
00:11:27,57 --> 00:11:28,76
Doing really worthwhile

106
00:11:28,76 --> 00:11:33,51
and important things with the money that we gained while building a house for example rather than being tapped into the

107
00:11:33,51 --> 00:11:38,08
mortgage belt for forty years or whatever. Have a long people get tapped into.

108
00:11:40,36 --> 00:11:47,54
And yeah it's like a subsidy to say ok you know a lot you can populate this area but after a while i think. Inherently.

109
00:11:47,54 --> 00:11:51,74
You know when you've got everything pretty well set up then it's time that we got the freight

110
00:11:51,74 --> 00:12:00,35
and we haven't got the financial pressure. You know that we can create these new.

111
00:12:00,35 --> 00:12:02,56
Little industries dr around the countryside

112
00:12:02,56 --> 00:12:09,42
and that so i've seen them been developing with a whole lot of small business. And really creative dynamics.

113
00:14:09,69 --> 00:14:14,65
And i think that's because we live in such a wrong. Environment we've.

114
00:14:14,65 --> 00:14:20,5
We're not because if we lived in europe where there's been people living for thousands of years you'd sort of somehow

115
00:14:20,5 --> 00:14:24,74
it infiltrates into your very bones the big. You know your very being.

116
00:14:24,74 --> 00:14:28,33
And that's what everybody thinks and talks about whereas here it's all very new

117
00:14:28,33 --> 00:14:34,5
and it's this whole new i just incredibly strong in people's conversations and how they dress.

118
00:14:34,5 --> 00:14:36,89
How they express themselves.

119
00:14:36,89 --> 00:14:44,34
And all that sort of thing is a sense of well being he said to you sometimes

120
00:14:44,34 --> 00:14:50,07
when i get out they are to go down to the city i think. Come on i think. You know the world changing everyone's.

121
00:14:50,07 --> 00:14:55,45
You know it's getting better. And i go out there i think oh i think i live in a little cocoon up here.

122
00:14:56,27 --> 00:15:03,44
I think there is a sense of. We are but separate and different from everybody but i think this gold coast woman that.

123
00:15:03,44 --> 00:15:09,94
Kind the other day she's really wiking out and talking about some new age stuff and. I think it's happening a lot of.

124
00:15:09,94 --> 00:15:13,79
I think nimbin is a real nucleus of it.

125
00:15:13,79 --> 00:15:18,94
And i think the rest of the world slowly followings like health foods you know ten years ago nobody had amused earlier

126
00:15:18,94 --> 00:15:25,19
as everybody eats and now. We've been eating it for twenty years and brown ross and tofu and all that.

127
00:15:25,19 --> 00:15:33,36
And i think we are a bit of a bit of a leader and him so a lot staal and food

128
00:15:33,36 --> 00:15:40,23
and all that sort of thing environmental issues of course that's always been. Top of the priority list.

129
00:15:40,23 --> 00:15:50,36
Terms of people creating more sustainable was to live. Simple directions.

130
00:15:50,36 --> 00:16:00,79
As long as you know they just yeah everybody's. Living enough.

131
00:16:01,24 --> 00:16:05,17
Well i don't see it as a negative thing i said i would say. I don't say.

132
00:16:05,17 --> 00:16:10,95
I see all the relationships at a gun through really hard times at the moment in the last. Few years.

133
00:16:11,25 --> 00:16:15,14
I see it as it will grow a challenge i see it as a real growth.

134
00:16:16,57 --> 00:16:22,02
Thing for growing you have to really look at yourself you gotta look at sun many different issues rather than just

135
00:16:22,02 --> 00:16:29,46
hanging in there with. Putting up with things that are good for you and good for kids.

136
00:16:29,46 --> 00:16:35,46
I think we all tain specially with the women around here we all get together and talk a lot about personal stuff

137
00:16:35,46 --> 00:16:42,07
and relationships and that sort of thing and i think it's we all grow and we're all a lot more compassionate and was

138
00:16:42,07 --> 00:16:54,3
and. More capable of having. Better quality relationships and. You know the average person.

139
00:16:54,3 --> 00:17:00,33
She's always been with pressures from living. While living.

140
00:17:00,33 --> 00:17:07,7
You know quite difficult to build your own house in most places. Was a factor.

141
00:17:07,7 --> 00:17:15,26
Yeah i think for people living together twenty four. As if when people broke up around here it's.

142
00:17:15,26 --> 00:17:20,76
You know we were living in each other's pockets twenty four hours a day seven days away you cannot think you do tend to

143
00:17:20,76 --> 00:17:22,82
get a bit sick of each other.

144
00:17:22,82 --> 00:17:27,03
Plus the whole struggle of surviving you know building houses

145
00:17:27,03 --> 00:17:31,9
and having babies at the same time living in taints in the weight season and.

146
00:17:31,9 --> 00:17:35,52
When you used the old color to even flush toilets.

147
00:17:35,52 --> 00:17:38,2
Which we have most of this kind from it's really really hard

148
00:17:38,2 --> 00:17:43,18
and then you often find with your partner quite happy to sort of live in a tent for four years.

149
00:17:43,18 --> 00:17:50,11
Was it for us women especially with by a base you just want to keep doing that so yeah i think it created a lot of

150
00:17:50,11 --> 00:17:53,89
tension and relationships. And just the hard yakka the hard work.

151
00:17:53,89 --> 00:17:58,6
And then there's the whole feminist the whole sort of six sixes. Role.

152
00:17:58,6 --> 00:18:02,55
Battle that went on like all the men out there with a child sewing and fixing the cars

153
00:18:02,55 --> 00:18:09,42
and the women looking after the buy. And people feeling a bit sort of stuck in their roles. You know. That sort.

154
00:18:09,74 --> 00:18:13,35
Thing i think created a lot of tension.

155
00:18:13,35 --> 00:18:26,14
So all of this this world was about seeing neilsen females as being different and here late.

156
00:18:26,14 --> 00:18:28,75
Not better not worse so i think some women love.

157
00:18:28,75 --> 00:18:33,83
Might last six cars and using chime souls are the main like looking after by using cooking in the kitchen.

158
00:18:35,36 --> 00:18:54,53
So if you lost. When you're using this as a single use have been for the last three or four years.

159
00:18:54,53 --> 00:18:59,93
Look it's fantastic living in a community is all lies somebody look up to you kid so.

160
00:18:59,93 --> 00:19:04,02
You know you can always share the whole parenting role. And for all the kids.

161
00:19:04,02 --> 00:19:08,43
You know especially when i get older all i have had a few coming in and i need to talk about their problems

162
00:19:08,43 --> 00:19:10,48
and i can't talk about it with their parents.

163
00:19:11,95 --> 00:19:15,42
You know for the kids there's a lot more adult interaction that i can get

164
00:19:15,42 --> 00:19:18,51
and i can get in they'd met a lot more from other adults.

165
00:19:18,51 --> 00:19:27,43
Rather than just their own parents because that was the one i think yes yeah well there are a lot more what must i

166
00:19:27,43 --> 00:19:33,53
think yes. This is it yeah. Well most of the kids seem to be really comfortable with other adults.

167
00:19:33,53 --> 00:19:38,47
And i like and walk into a room with adults and feel quite comfortable and sit there like come to a loud parties.

168
00:19:38,47 --> 00:19:43,31
And they're not so shuffled away. And they're very much part of the whole.

169
00:19:43,31 --> 00:19:46,6
Last fall he they are integrated and i think that's really really healthy i mean

170
00:19:46,6 --> 00:19:52,32
when i was a kid you know any visits guymon you a shovel at the back door. Say in a not hood sort of thing.

171
00:19:53,18 --> 00:20:00,21
And i think it gives the kids here a lot more law schools in terms of communicating and what i want. And i can.

172
00:20:00,21 --> 00:20:05,05
They're a lot more compassionate about people with problems i mean we've had quite a few people in benji who have had a

173
00:20:05,05 --> 00:20:10,05
few problems with mental problems and the kids just observe it in the. And.

174
00:20:10,05 --> 00:20:17,07
There are a lot more equipped to deal with people when they're older than you know sort of just had their own adult.

175
00:20:17,07 --> 00:20:33,84
Parents to rely to and. Want to get. Things. Downside. The kids here. I think the maybe. They often watch.

176
00:20:33,84 --> 00:20:39,11
Are you know. Happy families on the telly like the cross be shot on a ladder and they allow the video.

177
00:20:39,11 --> 00:20:46,66
And they are all there is and then come back and i got. Brown ross we can do a lot. And i often think that.

178
00:20:46,66 --> 00:20:51,59
You know a few years ago we were all worried at all that kids were going to go off and want to be yuppie policemen

179
00:20:51,59 --> 00:20:55,78
and lawyers and things like that.

180
00:20:55,78 --> 00:21:04,61
You know with the maid the external world stepping in i think in a lot of kids' minds it creates. They're not so happy.

181
00:21:04,61 --> 00:21:11,05
Rather have what i see on the telly. But as i get older i think that i realise what that.

182
00:21:11,05 --> 00:21:17,71
What that guy and he were and. You know it's not such a big get that they say.

183
00:21:17,71 --> 00:21:25,22
Is because you know come on those things. Cues. One way to get.

184
00:21:25,22 --> 00:21:31,08
Yeah yeah yeah well at the moment this is one of my things there's not a lot for the kids to get into.

185
00:21:31,85 --> 00:21:39,82
There's no not much work. You know it's a real pity.

186
00:21:39,82 --> 00:21:43,5
Nimbin ha school put in a submission to go on to eleven twelve and it was not

187
00:21:43,5 --> 00:21:48,16
but for the last make i cannot understand why there's so many kids.

188
00:21:48,16 --> 00:21:52,13
Coming up to that i got to jump in this bus and go on to lismore and back

189
00:21:52,13 --> 00:21:57,03
and then been school was going to offer a lot of diversity in terms of the schooling hours i could pick and choose

190
00:21:57,03 --> 00:22:02,6
when i came and went a lot of interesting. You know like the woodwork and middle work in the.

191
00:22:02,6 --> 00:22:07,23
All that sort of thing was going to be very strong personal development subjects were going to be strong as well as i

192
00:22:07,23 --> 00:22:09,42
say and. That was a real.

193
00:22:09,94 --> 00:22:16,6
Blood tomato a lot of kids a lot of kids going to school to use before they really shouldn't cause you know fifteen

194
00:22:16,6 --> 00:22:25,06
sixteen you know. Very immature. To call it was a lot. When you say seventeen after you've been through the system.

195
00:22:25,33 --> 00:22:31,21
So that's a real pity but i'll just say for a lot of the kids that the that it's slowly happening

196
00:22:31,21 --> 00:22:39,27
but we need to provide more work experience. You know. For them to tap into when they get older this.

197
00:22:39,27 --> 00:22:44,3
You know rather than having to go to the city or just to sit around on the ball when they finish school.

198
00:22:44,3 --> 00:22:49,75
That's very important to you now. And the sun i'm out at all the statistics out of the sun many kids now.

199
00:22:49,75 --> 00:22:50,61
Coming of age from.

200
00:22:51,12 --> 00:22:56,78
You know the seventy's that's what i ten years ago we got all these i ten year old kids that were born from the.

201
00:22:56,78 --> 00:23:05,43
Aquarius time and i really need something to decay into. So that's a that's a real challenge for them and then that.

202
00:23:05,43 --> 00:23:07,5
Maze a real hard priority.
