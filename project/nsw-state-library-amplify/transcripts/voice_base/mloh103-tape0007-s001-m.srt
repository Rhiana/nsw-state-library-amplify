1
00:00:16,67 --> 00:00:35,77
We're speaking with joey jackson. Double l. I e. Jackson normal. Ok. I came to australia. So i'm julie jackson.

2
00:00:35,77 --> 00:00:41,55
And i came to australia in one thousand nine hundred seventy three. After the aquarius festival.

3
00:00:42,2 --> 00:00:50,09
I heard about aquarius. When i was living in the himalayas in katmandu.

4
00:00:50,09 --> 00:00:59,52
Writing long and passionate letters to my sweetheart who was in australia at the time. We had met in hong kong and.

5
00:00:59,52 --> 00:01:10,61
I was taking a very long time to return to western civilization. I spent a year in kathmandu. Went to england and.

6
00:01:10,61 --> 00:01:18,82
Whilst i was. I was in england he sent me to get to come to australia south. It was an offer i wasn't able to refuse.

7
00:01:21,66 --> 00:01:29,37
I arrived in australia in august and. Came up to nimbin. About ten days later.

8
00:01:30,36 --> 00:01:39,17
And my arrival in the stroller had been a little disappointing.

9
00:01:39,17 --> 00:01:45,24
The love story wasn't quite the love story i thought it was and.

10
00:01:45,24 --> 00:01:54,08
It was very obvious that we weren't going to live happily ever after. So when i was coming.

11
00:01:54,08 --> 00:02:02,7
We were coming through from polling data having met my. Possible future in-laws. And came down to nimbin.

12
00:02:02,7 --> 00:02:13,86
And it was on the road to ukiah that i was struck by this of the well knowing that this is where i was supposed to be

13
00:02:13,86 --> 00:02:23,94
living this is where i was. Yes to be. The idea of nimbin and and. Aquarius. Was already very appealing to me.

14
00:02:23,94 --> 00:02:36,68
I had quit my job in hong kong. I said. I very jet set a fashion designer. Living fully and fast. Around the world.

15
00:02:37,48 --> 00:02:47,74
And i felt that i needed to make more. My life and having seen. What was happening in the world. I might believe.

16
00:02:47,74 --> 00:02:54,42
There was another way of doing things the. Commercialism and selfishness.

17
00:02:54,42 --> 00:03:00,92
That i experienced in on he didn't stick why i wasn't what i wanted to do.

18
00:03:01,71 --> 00:03:11,59
So you know i was living in sydney and being a playwright wife. What i wanted to do either. So.

19
00:03:11,59 --> 00:03:18,29
There was this knowledge that. That i had that nimbin was. I really should be but i had no idea how or.

20
00:03:18,29 --> 00:03:29,71
What was going to happen i went back to sydney and. Somehow i met the right people and.

21
00:03:29,71 --> 00:03:35,98
I ended up coming out to nimbin for the first time to build tribal meeting.

22
00:03:35,98 --> 00:03:44,07
Which would have been about september i think. With a very beautiful man called a poet called will techie.

23
00:03:44,07 --> 00:03:53,64
Who i don't know where he's in the world now. And i got the training and was hitching from.

24
00:03:53,64 --> 00:03:56,69
Lismore to nimbin and was picked up by carolyn norman.

25
00:03:56,69 --> 00:04:05,1
Who were to go on to be very important in my life and my children's lives. How was the midwife who set up.

26
00:04:05,1 --> 00:04:14,71
Birth and beyond and. Norman. Apart now. Is a great healer. And there i was in. Nimbin.

27
00:04:15,38 --> 00:04:22,55
And with nowhere to go nowhere to stay i didn't know anybody except for will who had his own. Own things to do.

28
00:04:23,48 --> 00:04:29,18
And an intention to go to the first time to the trouble meeting. I had a job. By the way and.

29
00:04:29,18 --> 00:04:37,48
To repay my voice to a sweet hat back. For my ticket. To strike.

30
00:04:37,48 --> 00:04:50,93
And i never been in those days was very small was very warm and very friendly. And. Anybody new in town.

31
00:04:50,93 --> 00:04:54,2
Was immediately. Now to simple. And immediately.

32
00:04:54,2 --> 00:05:02,3
People would come and welcome you and talk to you and so on and it so happened that this beautiful blue eyed.

33
00:05:02,3 --> 00:05:10,57
Doc i lashed. Young man. Sat down beside me and sat started talking to me. And introduced himself as mark.

34
00:05:10,57 --> 00:05:15,54
And i said do you know where i can stay and he said oh well we've got a bass you could come

35
00:05:15,54 --> 00:05:24,91
and stand the bells at old toby. So i'll tell bees from lord of the rings i think of something.

36
00:05:24,91 --> 00:05:35,68
And all these wonderful names of places that were developed in those days and. As true romance would have it.

37
00:05:36,82 --> 00:05:47,63
Mark who i mean named marcus. And i fell in love and. Had three babies and. Got married at some stage and.

38
00:05:47,63 --> 00:05:59,82
Then parted at some stage and remained very good friends over the babies and. What is it. Humans to come and.

39
00:05:59,82 --> 00:06:07,33
It's a very green. And rich and for candour you know it smells fertile.

40
00:06:07,33 --> 00:06:14,71
Things grow over night you can sit and watch things grow and. The feeling in.

41
00:06:15,04 --> 00:06:19,62
In the seventy's certainly within my generation was. I guess we were.

42
00:06:19,62 --> 00:06:27,38
We obviously young and of child bearing age and there was a great. Hope. Great optimism.

43
00:06:27,38 --> 00:06:31,46
For the future that we wanted to make things different and.

44
00:06:31,46 --> 00:06:41,23
Part of making things different is creating the generation to carry that on. And a desire to do it differently.

45
00:06:42,42 --> 00:06:50,00
Many many of us had had experience. Childhoods that were maybe not as helpful as could be that were.

46
00:06:50,00 --> 00:06:55,65
Were pressured by materialism which we all benefited from. But there was that that.

47
00:06:55,65 --> 00:06:59,67
Pendulum looking back now with the wisdom of age. You know there was that pendulum.

48
00:06:59,67 --> 00:07:06,83
Of wanting to reject all of that materialism which we saw was leading us down a fairly devastating path.

49
00:07:06,83 --> 00:07:08,91
As we experiencing now.

50
00:07:10,16 --> 00:07:18,14
So yeah to to to make families to create and create a new society

51
00:07:18,14 --> 00:07:30,01
and part of creating a new society is creating new life. And so and. Such a joyful process. I mean for me.

52
00:07:30,01 --> 00:07:39,33
Having babies was one of the most amazing. Joyful. Experiences i've ever ever had in mind i i i. You know.

53
00:07:39,33 --> 00:07:51,37
I love having babies. I love being pregnant. And and. And i love. The nurturing. You know it's. It was some.

54
00:07:54,6 --> 00:07:56,26
It was something that.

55
00:07:56,26 --> 00:08:03,53
That has always been part of my nature but it really came into its full when i had my babies and and.

56
00:08:03,53 --> 00:08:14,71
Expressed itself in me. Looking after everybody else's babies too. And i became a witness. And.

57
00:08:15,3 --> 00:08:24,92
Was an official witness and. I had three. Three babies long term for.

58
00:08:24,92 --> 00:08:32,67
Thoughtful periods of time one for three months i think. I fed. Ruby. And my son.

59
00:08:32,67 --> 00:08:39,67
I moved into the house with ruby's pants and and nursed her watched her mother was.

60
00:08:39,67 --> 00:08:50,11
Was ill and and to what my own children with me. I had three. By then and. All told.

61
00:08:50,11 --> 00:08:55,82
That the rough tally is around two hundred babies that i that i breastfed over the years.

62
00:08:57,65 --> 00:09:05,05
It was it was natural it was a natural thing to do. Between the mothers who we were very close friends and.

63
00:09:05,05 --> 00:09:10,98
If there was for me if there was a baby that was crying or a mama that was tired.

64
00:09:10,98 --> 00:09:19,39
It was so easy and very simple for me to just nurse the baby and. Maybe take take that. Take it a baby for a night.

65
00:09:19,39 --> 00:09:27,15
To give their mother a rest. People did the same thing for me too. It wasn't a one way street and.

66
00:09:27,15 --> 00:09:35,25
It was part of the tribal feeling that we experienced in those days. And so now.

67
00:09:35,25 --> 00:09:47,31
It's sort of seventeen eighteen years later. I miss seeing. Many of my. Mighty babies is. As i think of him. You know.

68
00:09:48,04 --> 00:09:58,99
At dances and clubs and parties and. And seeing them growing up and even. I'm sort of a t.v. Granny now.

69
00:09:58,99 --> 00:10:02,28
When the one of the children that i looked up to recently had a baby

70
00:10:02,28 --> 00:10:05,11
and i don't know how many are they've all scattered to the four winds and.

71
00:10:05,11 --> 00:10:10,01
In many cases but a lot of them is still around and they're that precious and beautiful young people

72
00:10:10,01 --> 00:10:19,9
and i have very good connections with many of them still. Coming to you. And that's.

73
00:10:22,73 --> 00:10:30,82
It was while that was one aspect of it. Yes the desire to do it differently. The desire for different experiences. The.

74
00:10:30,82 --> 00:10:35,82
The the longing to move away from the.

75
00:10:35,82 --> 00:10:43,56
The mechanical and impersonal and come to know that that giving birth is a natural thing it's not not.

76
00:10:44,1 --> 00:10:52,68
Not an illness it didn't need to be hospitalized. I guess it was. It was a step further step beyond the.

77
00:10:52,68 --> 00:11:00,28
The little boy a method that was already very popular in europe and. I think probably in australia.

78
00:11:00,28 --> 00:11:05,09
In england the home birth was. It was it was a fairly normal sort of thing.

79
00:11:05,09 --> 00:11:07,82
Two of my sisters were both born at home and i was present for the.

80
00:11:07,82 --> 00:11:16,84
For those births and that with their pain and that their thirty's. So. You know that that.

81
00:11:18,79 --> 00:11:23,03
Yeah that was one aspect of the humber. And the closeness and support.

82
00:11:23,03 --> 00:11:28,5
Support network that was built up between the women. Was very important.

83
00:11:28,98 --> 00:11:35,9
Not only was that this is they actually having a baby at home. Important but. But that the support afterwards which.

84
00:11:35,9 --> 00:11:42,62
Which varied in some cases it was full on and. And wonderful and. And is in all of those things sometimes it.

85
00:11:42,62 --> 00:11:48,18
Missed the mark and and. Wasn't perhaps as good as it could have been. But we you know.

86
00:11:48,18 --> 00:11:52,06
We did beautiful things and it was you know. Again.

87
00:11:52,06 --> 00:11:55,54
Those bonds that were set up in the eyes to those days are still very strong.

88
00:11:57,29 --> 00:12:05,29
And as the children grew up and as we grew up as women you know as we grew up. And changed and.

89
00:12:05,29 --> 00:12:14,71
Experiences changed our needs changed. You know. We developed in two to two women who wanted something else and.

90
00:12:14,97 --> 00:12:27,21
I needed to grow and. The. We had the women's group. Which was a very strong and.

91
00:12:27,21 --> 00:12:36,81
Dynamic and exciting time for a lot of us and. Was a shift in many many of the women's lives. Women.

92
00:12:36,81 --> 00:12:47,06
I'm trying to remember. I'm dreadful on dates. It would have been. Late seventy's.

93
00:12:47,85 --> 00:12:58,11
It would have been someone in the late in the seventy's it was you know was it in the late seventy's the women's group.

94
00:12:58,11 --> 00:13:05,41
Started we we would surely met. In blue knob. Round blue knob area. There were.

95
00:13:05,41 --> 00:13:09,68
I think there was other groups of women as well meeting and. In in the area.

96
00:13:09,68 --> 00:13:18,48
The one that i was involved in met it playing up once a week. And there was probably. Up to about twelve women.

97
00:13:18,48 --> 00:13:30,83
Coming together and. We would have. Have set. Id set. Agendas on some nights. Themes. Telling our story.

98
00:13:30,83 --> 00:13:39,76
Exploring options discussing things it wasn't an incredibly angry sort of a group of women it was more. Of discovering.

99
00:13:39,76 --> 00:13:45,93
Supportive. Nurturing. Raping women. You know this.

100
00:13:45,93 --> 00:13:50,18
The ideas of women's groups being sort of bunches of hardened sort of.

101
00:13:50,18 --> 00:13:55,22
Bitching about the men and things and it wasn't like that too. It was there was the odd bits of course.

102
00:13:55,22 --> 00:14:14,71
But you know that having that are not just true. They became a tribal event because they weren't. Confined to the.

103
00:14:14,94 --> 00:14:21,2
It's the best at home. Became a tribal event.

104
00:14:21,2 --> 00:14:30,51
Because they were not confined to two medical personnel being present or the official personnel being present. No just.

105
00:14:30,51 --> 00:14:39,4
Immediate family members. So at some births there would be. Maybe a dozen people around the place people to cook.

106
00:14:39,4 --> 00:14:45,64
People to to look after other children people to look after the other people's children. And.

107
00:14:45,64 --> 00:14:51,51
And general supporters there was. And people came and went. You know it was a long birth the people would be coming.

108
00:14:51,51 --> 00:15:01,99
Coming and going and. There was a lot of interest you know. We. The birth and beyond. Group met. Every tuesday.

109
00:15:01,99 --> 00:15:09,59
And there was. Prenatal classes and. And post natal classes and so on that and meetings of women to to support.

110
00:15:09,59 --> 00:15:13,77
And fathers to the fathers because you know. You know.

111
00:15:13,77 --> 00:15:17,7
We were very actively involved in the whole process and the caring of the children.

112
00:15:17,7 --> 00:15:20,79
As well i think that that's something that.

113
00:15:20,79 --> 00:15:29,23
It isn't isn't recognised enough i think that a lot of nimbin dads have done a very good job. You know it's.

114
00:15:29,23 --> 00:15:38,08
It's perhaps a difficult one to sort of to to single out isn't it wonderful that men are involved in child rearing

115
00:15:38,08 --> 00:15:42,3
but tradition is is such that. That men are not involved in child rearing. Women.

116
00:15:42,3 --> 00:15:45,68
You know have traditionally done that

117
00:15:45,68 --> 00:15:51,54
and sometimes it's been something we've kept to ourselves i know that for me that was probably an issue and.

118
00:15:51,54 --> 00:15:59,85
And so yeah the menfolk have played a part. As well as being caught up in the more traditional roles of.

119
00:15:59,85 --> 00:16:07,81
House building and. And so on and the women have also been involved vice versa in the house building and so on.

120
00:16:07,81 --> 00:16:22,55
Was so it was. Oh that's just. Absolutely i mean. Although i was a home birth. Helper. Myself.

121
00:16:22,55 --> 00:16:30,8
I had my three children in the hospital. The first one was because she was a breech baby. No she wasn't.

122
00:16:30,8 --> 00:16:32,66
She was before the birth.

123
00:16:32,66 --> 00:16:40,35
The first one was my first child was born in hospital because that home birth movement was very young at that stage

124
00:16:40,35 --> 00:16:44,31
and i think only one baby had been born out in the area then.

125
00:16:44,31 --> 00:16:52,15
And i didn't feel confident enough it was later on that i got involved. Really fully.

126
00:16:52,15 --> 00:16:55,86
My second child was born in hospital because she was a breech baby.

127
00:16:55,86 --> 00:16:59,97
And the third one there were other complications in his birth so they were.

128
00:16:59,97 --> 00:17:07,71
They were all born in the hospital but it was a very very positive experience. Emily was the first baby. He baby.

129
00:17:07,71 --> 00:17:14,5
To be born in in lismore base hospital. And they were very supportive. I mean we still i still had to go out.

130
00:17:14,5 --> 00:17:22,15
Undergo some of the indignities like shaving and. In animals which don't even happen in normal births now.

131
00:17:22,75 --> 00:17:26,22
But they allowed me to do a lot of the other things that i wanted and.

132
00:17:26,22 --> 00:17:29,01
Even to the point of letting me take the center home which they.

133
00:17:29,01 --> 00:17:36,97
They found that the placenta was wrapped up in an in a lovely purple plastic bag and.

134
00:17:36,97 --> 00:17:41,01
And kept in the refrigeration till i went home. And they let me out the next day.

135
00:17:41,01 --> 00:17:50,99
You know with a few sort of and worried looks. So from from that. To. When will was born. It was. It was beautiful.

136
00:17:50,99 --> 00:18:00,46
You know it was just really beautiful. I had. Carolyn norman with me. I had another friend there. His father.

137
00:18:00,46 --> 00:18:08,95
The birth was done in exactly the way that i wanted to to do it out. You know. I couldn't have asked for better.

138
00:18:08,95 --> 00:18:15,46
In that sort of environment. And. And after the birth we were left alone and. He wasn't.

139
00:18:15,46 --> 00:18:19,62
Whisked off to be bathed in measured in weight and faster on paper.

140
00:18:19,62 --> 00:18:28,09
So i think that the the influence of the humbert movement in the hospitals has been has been good as you know

141
00:18:28,09 --> 00:18:34,17
and there were some fears and difficult things but. I think it's been through and i think it's being pulled.

142
00:18:34,17 --> 00:18:39,38
And in cairo. They have a birthing center which is. Is the next step.

143
00:18:39,38 --> 00:18:47,06
From having a sit in between having a home birth and. And a hospital bed. So yeah it's been influential. And.

144
00:18:47,06 --> 00:18:55,52
And i think that it. It. It. That positive and supportive. Generally. Approach that that. The hospital has.

145
00:18:55,52 --> 00:18:59,48
Makes it easier for women who are perhaps in a risky. Group.

146
00:18:59,48 --> 00:19:04,4
To to be it to feel comfortable about having their babies in the hospital.

147
00:19:04,4 --> 00:19:11,64
You know it's water births and things like that.

148
00:19:11,64 --> 00:19:16,55
I've not been present in water but i know a number of baby sort of been born in water births

149
00:19:16,55 --> 00:19:27,32
and i've seen the movies and son. Seems wonderful. And. And hospitals around the place also provide that service to.

150
00:19:27,32 --> 00:19:35,01
And and doctors are involved in it. I think that it's just. Off that. Now we. It's not just either.

151
00:19:35,01 --> 00:19:40,17
Hospital or a dangerous bet at hamill's or sun you know have to think the the.

152
00:19:40,17 --> 00:19:46,47
The options of if you were having the more options.

153
00:19:46,47 --> 00:19:53,9
Recently there's been a backlash as we always experience and in change. And i believe that.

154
00:19:53,9 --> 00:20:03,61
You know that the non-accredited midwives are not allowed to to to deliver babies at home and this is. I think a very.

155
00:20:03,61 --> 00:20:21,89
Retrograde step. You know it was because you know as soon as you saw in you. Was tradition. I think.

156
00:20:21,89 --> 00:20:25,56
I think it's again about that pendulum. It's about.

157
00:20:25,56 --> 00:20:31,74
I think what had happened in the in the sixty's the fifty's and sixty's post-war was that had been that great swing.

158
00:20:31,74 --> 00:20:42,57
To to fit to model. To materialism. To to getting away from from the the spirit in community.

159
00:20:42,95 --> 00:20:47,97
And so it was a very very fast swing on the pendulum and and.

160
00:20:47,97 --> 00:20:55,29
Sometimes you have to swing the pendulum right the other way. You know to to to throw all of that stuff away. So that.

161
00:20:55,29 --> 00:21:00,68
Set to two then come back to some kind of balance to find out. To sort out what.

162
00:21:00,68 --> 00:21:09,5
What is necessary in what isn't necessary to to to find out. You know. A balance and. And sure.

163
00:21:09,5 --> 00:21:12,25
You know i think there was there was a. You know.

164
00:21:12,25 --> 00:21:18,76
I would never want to be scrubbing and washing nappies in a in a in a copper. Again.

165
00:21:18,76 --> 00:21:25,23
Even if i was young and starting at you know it was. It's. It was hard work and particularly for the women.

166
00:21:25,23 --> 00:21:32,47
It was very very hard work and i think that we you know. The were there wasn't the time often.

167
00:21:32,47 --> 00:21:43,94
To to do a lot of the things that would have been good to do. I mean. I would always. You know give over.

168
00:21:43,94 --> 00:21:48,14
Housework in favor of playing with my children so i was good in a fairly chaotic has but.

169
00:21:48,14 --> 00:21:52,62
When you have to chop the wood to cook the food. When you have to cut the water to do those things.

170
00:21:52,62 --> 00:21:58,52
When you have to dig the garden to get there the food. It's it's very hard work.

171
00:21:58,52 --> 00:22:03,54
And yet you don't need all the mod cons and things that are happening you don't need all that the fast foods

172
00:22:03,54 --> 00:22:09,61
and things and that. The chemicals and. And so on that that are contributing to the destruction of the planet either.

173
00:22:09,79 --> 00:22:24,38
So it's finding that balance. What are my fondest memories my fondest memories. Picnics.

174
00:22:24,38 --> 00:22:36,69
Had wonderful picnics picnics and. Community gatherings. And the dances. We put on the birth and beyond. Wonderful.

175
00:22:36,69 --> 00:22:49,88
The folk club. The coming together of the community. Very very special memories and. And the smells. The not. The rain.

176
00:22:49,88 --> 00:22:59,00
When it's been sunny. Not the rain after it's rained for three months. And yet. That hope that the people.

177
00:22:59,00 --> 00:23:10,33
And the coming together of the people and. The coming together of many different people. Many of the. The original.

178
00:23:10,33 --> 00:23:20,75
Settlers the original. People who lived in the bay area very very dear friends of mine now. Who.

179
00:23:20,75 --> 00:23:28,39
I probably see more than a lot of the other. That the people who've been through and been of the.

180
00:23:28,39 --> 00:23:40,71
So many nimbin as a place for as a learning grant. As a wonderful. Learning ground a wonderful growing. Time.

181
00:23:40,71 --> 00:23:49,76
And it's got its pains as well you know this been. This has been difficult time. Us. Punk.

182
00:23:49,76 --> 00:24:00,97
There's been difficult times. You know that the survival. In the in the the eighties. You know.

183
00:24:00,97 --> 00:24:07,17
And the growing apart of my. My husband and i and.

184
00:24:07,17 --> 00:24:14,71
You know knowing that that this a daily life isn't going to to go on. I think maybe we.

185
00:24:14,98 --> 00:24:22,85
Plays a lot as children to you know has to be paired with our children so there was a certain unreality. There.

186
00:24:22,85 --> 00:24:30,16
That was very real in the dirt. And in the earth and in the being. But even now i think that.

187
00:24:30,16 --> 00:24:41,98
I was saying to somebody today that the lifestyle that we have on the north coast here. Is very special. You know and.

188
00:24:41,98 --> 00:24:46,56
It's not the why. A lot of the world lives. It's not the way that.

189
00:24:46,56 --> 00:24:56,73
That even the people that i meet in my work life and. I think we need to bear that in mind as well. You know that.

190
00:24:56,73 --> 00:25:05,61
There's a there's a lot of despair. And a lot of pain in the world and. We're very fortunate. On the north coast.

191
00:25:05,61 --> 00:25:13,59
So i think you know and it was a little bitch i was you know.

192
00:25:13,59 --> 00:25:31,19
So i think that that was naive it was an important part of the growing up.

193
00:25:31,19 --> 00:25:42,38
Of nimbin i suppose an important part of the exploration. That i think nimbin. Is going through and was going through.

194
00:25:42,38 --> 00:25:52,62
To everything has a duality. And so that that that. That childishness was part of the the oldness.

195
00:25:52,62 --> 00:26:03,01
Of knowing that that things were not going right. The wisdom that things were not going right. So again. To swing.

196
00:26:03,01 --> 00:26:07,58
To to that. Absolute simplicity.

197
00:26:08,54 --> 00:26:13,04
Was it was an important part if it hadn't happened it wouldn't you wouldn't have gone the whole way it's like you've

198
00:26:13,04 --> 00:26:18,28
got to push the age. And. And we'll do all of that.

199
00:26:18,28 --> 00:26:23,51
With that so-called lack of responsibility i mean it's all a matter of perception really i mean.

200
00:26:23,51 --> 00:26:29,26
I think perhaps it was a very responsible thing to do it's a very responsible thing to do to say hey now this.

201
00:26:29,26 --> 00:26:36,56
This isn't going the right way we've got to stop. The this. Greed and destruction and.

202
00:26:36,56 --> 00:26:44,75
Materialistic approach to things. We've got to find community again and get back to to the important things and.

203
00:26:44,75 --> 00:26:50,88
It was very very idealistic but unless you have something that's very idealistic unless you shoot high.

204
00:26:50,88 --> 00:26:58,13
You're not going to. You know going to you're not going to get very far. So.

205
00:26:58,13 --> 00:27:09,4
So i think that it is it is important to to have that that. That openness and simplicity and. Call it naive ety and.

206
00:27:09,4 --> 00:27:14,4
And with that then there's room to grow. And then there's room to grow up if you. If you. If you call it that.

207
00:27:14,4 --> 00:27:22,87
I had to take responsibility and to see that. The shadow side of things. In bins got it shut aside now it's.

208
00:27:22,87 --> 00:27:37,35
Acceptance has. Has has on one side has led to abuse people who abuse that acceptance. It's it's. Dropping of modern.

209
00:27:37,35 --> 00:27:44,64
Modernity and mod cons has led to to a lot of people getting very tired and a lot of people having to live.

210
00:27:44,64 --> 00:27:57,36
Very hard lives. The the. Rejecting. Of the sort of. Work unpaid work for. Full on supporting that.

211
00:27:57,36 --> 00:28:03,4
Capitalistic and materialistic society that. That was part of that has led to too.

212
00:28:03,4 --> 00:28:11,72
Perhaps an inability to to see to see other options for doing things. And that in its intent is lead to.

213
00:28:11,72 --> 00:28:19,72
In some cases lack of self-esteem and so on so forth. So. And at the same time we've got the rainbow. Power company.

214
00:28:19,72 --> 00:28:26,09
We've got children who are flexible and. Broad thinking. And caring.

215
00:28:26,97 --> 00:28:38,12
We've got a way of approaching things that is very different. The the. The home birth movement. The negotiation skills.

216
00:28:38,12 --> 00:28:43,07
Community living. Checking it out you know we can people can write in theory.

217
00:28:43,07 --> 00:28:48,54
About living in community and things where people in in the in bonaire in the north coast area. Because nimbin.

218
00:28:48,54 --> 00:28:53,45
Isn't just nimbin it's the north coast and beyond and beyond and beyond.

219
00:28:53,45 --> 00:28:58,06
So people are actually doing it and have been doing it for a long long time. You know.

220
00:28:58,06 --> 00:29:06,29
Buddy phone's been going for a long time temple's been going for a long time. And so on and so forth. Did you think.

221
00:29:06,29 --> 00:29:23,82
The things don't have to be. You know. Set in black and white. Oh no no no. I mean it's it's it's a business. For me.

222
00:29:23,82 --> 00:29:29,75
There's absolutely no sense of failure. I think that. I mean.

223
00:29:29,75 --> 00:29:40,21
If you if you take the approach to life which i have which is nothing is for no reason. That that. Every situation.

224
00:29:40,21 --> 00:29:54,95
Has a positive side and a negative side. Every cloud has a silver. So you know that the. The growing of nimbin that.

225
00:29:54,95 --> 00:30:02,29
The developing of nimbin the moving on from from the. The original aquarius. Dream is perfect. You know it's.

226
00:30:02,29 --> 00:30:12,82
There is there is pain. And there is. There is some some really negative things that could be focused on.

227
00:30:12,82 --> 00:30:18,5
And they're there. And there are the positive. If you see it on a long tim basis if you see it in a in.

228
00:30:18,5 --> 00:30:28,54
In the continuum of ages. It's just a minute little thing. You know. And the effects of it. Are huge. And so if you.

229
00:30:28,54 --> 00:30:38,05
You know. I refuse to get caught up in any. Breast beating and. Thanks to about it. You know it's. It is what is and.

230
00:30:38,05 --> 00:30:42,15
And it's growing and. People are still talking about it. It's.

231
00:30:42,15 --> 00:30:47,52
People are still talking about aquarius twenty years on that's you know. And people keep me. You know.

232
00:30:47,52 --> 00:30:54,67
Young people that still hold those will develop those ideals and and.

233
00:30:54,67 --> 00:31:01,8
The older people who've been involved in aquarius. Delusion changes.

234
00:31:01,8 --> 00:31:11,28
But once in a clarion call and you know i wasn't even there for the festival and you know.

235
00:31:11,28 --> 00:31:36,88
What was what is the best samples. As well that they did that they had an ism of of nimbin. Is is still.
