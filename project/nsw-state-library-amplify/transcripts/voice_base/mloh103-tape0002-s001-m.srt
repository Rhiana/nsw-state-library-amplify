1
00:00:20,01 --> 00:00:26,89
You know it does and i'm graham dunstan.

2
00:00:26,89 --> 00:00:34,11
I was the director of the aquarius festival in nine hundred seventy three and a came back to name and.

3
00:00:34,11 --> 00:00:40,01
As a name and resident. Between nine hundred seventy four like seventy four nine hundred eighty.

4
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:46,73
And worked on community development in him but so i have an intimate association with the post aquarius.

5
00:00:46,73 --> 00:01:00,57
Community development. Their name and if you count again. It will. Goes back to the beginning of the sixty's.

6
00:01:00,57 --> 00:01:08,47
And i went from school in dun troon. As a military could it. And i became very disillusioned with what was happening.

7
00:01:08,47 --> 00:01:14,19
As a cadet. In the army. Just worked out that the army wasn't for me.

8
00:01:14,19 --> 00:01:21,1
This was that the time of intense bastardize ation. Initiation the same time the university. Only did the.

9
00:01:21,1 --> 00:01:25,78
Duntroon was trying to become a cademy in degrees. So i would want to get it.

10
00:01:25,78 --> 00:01:32,24
To have economic training in the same time your life was run by drill sergeants and.

11
00:01:32,24 --> 00:01:41,36
Most immediate concerns was polishing your boots. So i sort of distinguish myself academically but had increasingly.

12
00:01:41,36 --> 00:01:44,37
Problems became the most. Punished get it done true.

13
00:01:44,54 --> 00:01:49,16
And during that time i was under a lot of pressure to resign and get out.

14
00:01:49,16 --> 00:01:55,6
And i was hanging in there so i could get the academic qualification would give me some exemptions at university.

15
00:01:55,6 --> 00:01:57,27
And the university.

16
00:01:57,27 --> 00:02:02,88
Appealed to me then to be some sort of salvation it was my ideal it was the place i really wanted to be.

17
00:02:04,33 --> 00:02:11,26
And so it was that i enrolled at university firstname and university for a year doing engineering.

18
00:02:11,79 --> 00:02:18,95
And i was approached by an easier. Asked to attend meetings right.

19
00:02:18,95 --> 00:02:25,65
To see what had happened was i thought well i've got all this military training when i'm going to do with it. And.

20
00:02:25,65 --> 00:02:30,91
So i applied to join the squadron university squadron in the hope that i'd learn to fly. And i was rejected.

21
00:02:30,91 --> 00:02:37,41
But they said we got something more important for you. Approached by these two guys from a zero saying.

22
00:02:37,41 --> 00:02:43,94
We want you to attend meetings and give us reports about what's going on. And being. Straight out of the army and.

23
00:02:43,94 --> 00:02:49,41
Straight out of school having no political sophistication of two or less that will. Sounds like a to me. I want to.

24
00:02:49,41 --> 00:02:56,41
I want to go to these meetings anyway so it became my regular lunch time.

25
00:02:56,41 --> 00:02:59,91
At the university not to sit with engineering students down the engineering faculty

26
00:02:59,91 --> 00:03:06,21
but actually plug into all these meetings that were happening. And of course the momentum as i tended to.

27
00:03:06,21 --> 00:03:09,64
The more interested i became in the danger of the lift

28
00:03:09,64 --> 00:03:13,1
and particularly the information about what was happening in southeast asia.

29
00:03:13,1 --> 00:03:19,02
Because i had some inkling in this when i was at duntroon they were already. Briefing us about southeast asia.

30
00:03:19,02 --> 00:03:22,99
And preparing the. Offices for a southeast asian war.

31
00:03:22,99 --> 00:03:28,09
And part of the tension with duntroon was they changed the conditions that they announced that they weren't going to

32
00:03:28,09 --> 00:03:33,01
accept any more resignations of officers that were actually going to build up the army. At that time.

33
00:03:33,71 --> 00:03:40,33
So if i'd expected to commission i don't train i would have been in for a life time is what they are telling us and.

34
00:03:41,42 --> 00:03:48,01
So i thought well this is the other side of the coin finding out from the left. What's going on in southeast asia.

35
00:03:48,01 --> 00:03:55,33
The year after. I did when you were at melbourne university then transferred to the university of new south wales and.

36
00:03:55,33 --> 00:03:58,55
Again attended meetings got very interested in the labor club and.

37
00:03:58,55 --> 00:04:01,32
The difference between the university of new south wales.

38
00:04:01,32 --> 00:04:05,93
And the university of melbourne was the university new south wales a very new campus in the didn't have the

39
00:04:05,93 --> 00:04:10,86
infrastructure of student clubs and societies. The old university had. So i felt.

40
00:04:10,86 --> 00:04:18,56
We hope to start creating it so i started organizing my own meetings my own talks. And again i was approached by a.c.s.

41
00:04:18,56 --> 00:04:23,75
and To get back into it i think i had about four meetings at this time

42
00:04:23,75 --> 00:04:31,84
but eventually i was elected president of the labor club. And i had to tell is it time to compromising.

43
00:04:31,84 --> 00:04:38,9
To be president of the labor club at university new south wales. So i've. I became.

44
00:04:38,9 --> 00:04:45,1
Thanks to the initiation that i was you know offered me a very active. Student organizer. And involved in the.

45
00:04:45,1 --> 00:04:52,06
And this will moratorium. Initial learn and teach ins. And inviting people to talk about.

46
00:04:52,06 --> 00:04:56,36
What was happening on the campus. And from the labor club i became.

47
00:04:56,36 --> 00:04:59,7
Present the students union an interest of the student newspaper.

48
00:04:59,7 --> 00:05:06,51
Not full time student activist along with a pool time engineering degree. And.

49
00:05:08,43 --> 00:05:14,48
Became one of the principal organizers of the protest movement. On the campus.

50
00:05:15,57 --> 00:05:24,17
I came back to the you know graduated in one in sixty seven and. Work. The next year sixty eight.

51
00:05:24,17 --> 00:05:27,1
Fruit which i can remember.

52
00:05:27,1 --> 00:05:33,03
I've had a job as a computer programmer for a while and then came back to the university nine hundred seventy.

53
00:05:33,03 --> 00:05:40,81
To do a degree in sociology and was again invited to reengage in student politics. And that was the year of.

54
00:05:40,81 --> 00:05:45,38
The when he begun editing. The record i was the director of student publications.

55
00:05:45,38 --> 00:05:52,52
So i was right back in the thick of the organizing. And by this time i'd got to appreciate this.

56
00:05:52,52 --> 00:05:55,02
These were the moratorium years got to appreciate that.

57
00:05:55,02 --> 00:06:00,23
What was really working with the antiwar movement any conscription movement. Was that.

58
00:06:00,23 --> 00:06:07,63
Not so much giving people information and. Talking at people. Public meetings. But so. But more the.

59
00:06:07,63 --> 00:06:14,08
The cultural movement the sense of every time we had a protest in the street. It was a festival.

60
00:06:14,08 --> 00:06:22,2
This time was sort of introduced to the. Thing. And i one day. The sort of a statement about the power of joy.

61
00:06:22,2 --> 00:06:29,18
And i begin to realize that the way you can create cultural movement remember i was doing social najee was to create.

62
00:06:29,18 --> 00:06:30,98
Events where people should do it.

63
00:06:30,98 --> 00:06:33,39
So i got very interested in this strategy

64
00:06:33,39 --> 00:06:39,13
and whenever we organize an event on the campus we'd always do it with the band. It was like a celebration.

65
00:06:40,33 --> 00:06:44,9
So i got very interested in festivals. Nine hundred seventy one.

66
00:06:44,9 --> 00:06:52,29
The aquarius foundation of the australian union of students had a festival i think was the first aquarius festival.

67
00:06:52,29 --> 00:06:59,23
On the campus of the university. Of i you know it was a in the national strike the national university.

68
00:07:01,28 --> 00:07:07,97
And this was an extraordinary festival. And i went along. And was delighted that.

69
00:07:07,97 --> 00:07:13,44
At the the activity because students come from all around the straight at this time the street in union of students was

70
00:07:13,44 --> 00:07:15,43
a very strong union.

71
00:07:15,43 --> 00:07:22,21
It had an escalating membership there's more cia's were brought online and sort of welcomed into the fold

72
00:07:22,21 --> 00:07:24,6
and every student was paying fifty cents to be a member.

73
00:07:25,94 --> 00:07:32,45
So it had a sort of an increasing budget and had more and more departments. It was opening up with it.

74
00:07:32,45 --> 00:07:36,34
And they starting new students at that time was responsible. If they had travel.

75
00:07:36,34 --> 00:07:41,77
Brands that it sort of taken off like a rocket. It's. Abscam all.

76
00:07:41,77 --> 00:07:47,55
Department which was regionally about raising money to get students or. Aboriginal students through university it.

77
00:07:47,55 --> 00:07:50,97
Had picked up on the land. Land rights issue the education department.

78
00:07:50,97 --> 00:07:56,38
Writing the agenda for the labor party the education agenda for the labor party.

79
00:07:56,38 --> 00:07:58,66
International pop and all these kind of things happening.

80
00:07:58,66 --> 00:08:04,37
It had been an organization had previously been under control of the cia funding and stuff

81
00:08:04,37 --> 00:08:09,8
and it sort of done this huge turn during the late sixty's in the early seventy's.

82
00:08:10,22 --> 00:08:15,94
And one of the things that it created was a cultural arm and. The idea was that the queerest foundation would.

83
00:08:16,82 --> 00:08:20,85
The responsible for campus too is of artists and speakers.

84
00:08:20,85 --> 00:08:28,22
And it was a vision of this sort of national organizing body. And then every two years it would organize a fist of all.

85
00:08:28,22 --> 00:08:31,57
Which was originally conceived of as being.

86
00:08:31,57 --> 00:08:37,24
Bringing all the aid into vasty groups together so that all the dramatic societies would come and perform.

87
00:08:37,24 --> 00:08:43,91
At this festival and all the debating society. Would come. If you're ready.

88
00:08:44,27 --> 00:08:48,79
All the dramatic societies and all the debating the size the cars the size would come together in one place

89
00:08:48,79 --> 00:08:55,61
and have a festival. Well when they came together it. I knew in nine hundred seventy one. Something else.

90
00:08:55,61 --> 00:09:03,77
Spun off the synergy of the situation was having all those embassies and symbols of authority.

91
00:09:04,12 --> 00:09:08,98
The students were extremely reactive and like every day. A protest would be organized.

92
00:09:09,23 --> 00:09:12,75
So that the for mentor of the of the.

93
00:09:12,75 --> 00:09:17,53
The festival wasn't so much around the program of events which was quite interesting in itself.

94
00:09:17,53 --> 00:09:22,87
But the student activity that arose spontaneously from all the student activists coming from all around the stranger.

95
00:09:22,87 --> 00:09:32,6
To one place. Now i was greatly stimulated by this and. After i returned to sydney. I had a meeting with. Johnny allen.

96
00:09:32,6 --> 00:09:36,42
And journey along with an old friend who'd been doing.

97
00:09:39,28 --> 00:09:47,2
Arts drama degree at the university and i had known him through east. Theatre organization. And he.

98
00:09:47,2 --> 00:09:52,32
After leaving university had taken up an organized. Among other things the thought of the arts factory.

99
00:09:52,75 --> 00:09:55,26
Sorry he was which was like the first rock and roll being you.

100
00:09:55,26 --> 00:10:01,33
And was very interested in organizing festivals kind of cultural festivals in one hundred seventy one i got to say i

101
00:10:01,33 --> 00:10:05,36
was the editor of the university paper against the rancor.

102
00:10:05,36 --> 00:10:11,84
And i was running it in on the theme of on the counterculture had been greatly influenced by theodore roosevelt's book

103
00:10:11,84 --> 00:10:16,96
called the making of the counterculture. So i was looking around to see what sort of. As we're coming.

104
00:10:16,96 --> 00:10:25,67
As a result of the impact of the antiwar move any conscription movement what sort of cultural. Things were rising.

105
00:10:25,67 --> 00:10:29,89
And each edition of the paper each week. We would produce.

106
00:10:29,89 --> 00:10:36,58
Invite a guest editor in and explore a particular theme so the themes. Typically were.

107
00:10:36,58 --> 00:10:47,98
Anti psychiatry ecology health foods. Spirituality drugs.

108
00:10:50,08 --> 00:10:55,56
Such themes such things and i've had to with the talk to johnny on about some of this.

109
00:10:55,56 --> 00:10:58,99
And we had a meeting we was at the why of all places.

110
00:10:58,99 --> 00:11:06,82
And johnny had been at the curtis festival in at i and u two and we sort of set them compared notes

111
00:11:06,82 --> 00:11:11,46
and both agreed that it was an extraordinary event. To bring students together. This time.

112
00:11:11,46 --> 00:11:15,16
And probably the program was getting in the way of the festival.

113
00:11:15,53 --> 00:11:26,03
And wouldn't be a great idea if we would organize the fist of all students. And not have the standard arts. Program.

114
00:11:26,03 --> 00:11:32,21
But rather take the fifth of all the way from university whether it had all the symbols of authority to react to

115
00:11:32,21 --> 00:11:38,3
and ask the question what are we for run. Make it a life style festival and put the question to people.

116
00:11:38,3 --> 00:11:46,82
What do you believe in what kind of future you. Do you want to create. Well. We walked up and down the street to the y.

117
00:11:46,82 --> 00:11:50,25
Beach talking about this. One of will think we finished with agreement.

118
00:11:50,25 --> 00:11:58,84
That i would write an article about it for a straight line. And that you know it's right in university student.

119
00:11:58,84 --> 00:12:03,81
A straight in you know a student's publication called national you. Which i did.

120
00:12:03,81 --> 00:12:08,13
And it was published and i forgot all about them. Done that.

121
00:12:08,13 --> 00:12:12,95
And the nine hundred seventy two i was teaching and electron boys high school

122
00:12:12,95 --> 00:12:15,94
when i received a call from the organizers the aquarius.

123
00:12:16,31 --> 00:12:20,74
Foundation saying we're advertising for the festival director not in seventy three.

124
00:12:20,74 --> 00:12:26,11
We really like what you wrote in the paper. Why don't you apply. So i think teaching was going to really suck.

125
00:12:27,73 --> 00:12:34,9
And i put it in that location and. Was flown to melbourne and interviewed. And at the time.

126
00:12:34,9 --> 00:12:41,67
The strenuous students had invited i've been in look out for a sort of the who i haven't really because the sort of.

127
00:12:41,67 --> 00:12:49,52
Third wolf the last of the. About going to say. Development in the third world. Alternative options and.

128
00:12:49,52 --> 00:12:50,52
Particularly deschooling.

129
00:12:51,13 --> 00:12:56,13
And that's kind of and i was sort of blown out by the ideas that this man was coming up with and.

130
00:12:56,91 --> 00:13:03,98
I was it was after one of these talks that i heard from the interviewing committee that i'd got the job and.

131
00:13:03,98 --> 00:13:04,57
They'd also.

132
00:13:04,57 --> 00:13:09,14
They said we'd also interviewed for another position the director of the queerest foundation and do you know.

133
00:13:09,14 --> 00:13:12,36
John i thought i called johnny allen he's also from sydney. So it was like.

134
00:13:12,36 --> 00:13:14,76
Fight through us together and he was johnny allen

135
00:13:14,76 --> 00:13:19,07
and graeme dunstan appointed to the only two positions in the aquarius foundation.

136
00:13:19,07 --> 00:13:21,35
The only two paid positions to organize.

137
00:13:21,35 --> 00:13:27,41
Among other things the queerest of the one hundred seventy three so we had a blueprint. Already worked out.

138
00:13:27,41 --> 00:13:29,92
And then we had the job of putting it together.

139
00:13:30,32 --> 00:13:37,05
There were two things that were required for that one was to get the message across to people that they should come as

140
00:13:37,05 --> 00:13:41,06
tribes and. Bring something to present to the festival. It is not.

141
00:13:41,54 --> 00:13:45,00
We had this thing that this is not to consume with this to that we have to make this festival.

142
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:52,62
So if you got a particular thing or. You're presenting. Like the alternative community telephone.

143
00:13:52,62 --> 00:14:01,00
That the time was hot in sydney. And it was like an information same service. Run by stephen warman and.

144
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:07,47
Horan will walk out of the get the horn horn buy a dell horn. And.

145
00:14:07,47 --> 00:14:14,13
We asked them to help us publicize this will but also bring up their ideas about community and.

146
00:14:14,13 --> 00:14:15,94
Come to the fist of will and bring their ideas about.

147
00:14:16,58 --> 00:14:22,07
Communications and so they did eventually very helpful in distributing information about the festival.

148
00:14:22,07 --> 00:14:31,76
And they came as a big try this tool and also another example would be. The feeble foundry. Gribble street duran.

149
00:14:31,76 --> 00:14:34,22
So that the whole home will bakery.

150
00:14:34,22 --> 00:14:39,83
That developed the it was also kind of a community center and tribe and they agreed to come

151
00:14:39,83 --> 00:14:45,37
and not have you come there you can put the bread making techniques in top of the wood bakery and they bake the bread.

152
00:14:45,37 --> 00:14:51,43
For the festival. And that was the kind of reach we the message we wanted to put out to people.

153
00:14:51,43 --> 00:14:57,49
And the other issue was like finding a site for the festival. That wasn't a university campus.

154
00:14:58,04 --> 00:15:06,54
And wasn't in the same time and place where people could camp and. Reflect in would rather than now.

155
00:15:06,54 --> 00:15:09,46
And that was my job to find the site.

156
00:15:09,46 --> 00:15:20,37
And we reasoned that the southern states were too cold and queensland was too hostile politically and. Sort of than.

157
00:15:20,37 --> 00:15:24,35
The northern rivers area the north coast of new south wales seemed like the best bits.

158
00:15:24,35 --> 00:15:28,89
And it also had a mythology going forward that we'd heard about this mythical place.

159
00:15:28,89 --> 00:15:37,19
And surfing paradise called byron bay. And there was something happening behind. Mom and bindi. That were rumors off.

160
00:15:37,63 --> 00:15:41,86
So we set up the set off to explore this area and.

161
00:15:42,69 --> 00:15:47,16
I have a ties in the local papers for a suitable so i'm a kind of looking fool. You know.

162
00:15:47,16 --> 00:15:53,88
Three hundred acres of something. You know. Of idyllic countryside that would. Might become a community afterwards and.

163
00:15:53,88 --> 00:16:01,57
The system would least something substantial after it. After we had it. And i had absolutely no response.

164
00:16:01,57 --> 00:16:04,95
Right no one answered the ads and i travelled around used to get around real estate agents

165
00:16:04,95 --> 00:16:07,58
and i was getting exhausted and.

166
00:16:07,58 --> 00:16:12,27
Consuming lots of petrol running up lots of petrol driving around the north coast looking at properties.

167
00:16:13,26 --> 00:16:17,11
And we were running out of time it was getting into. November.

168
00:16:17,11 --> 00:16:26,31
And that decision had to be in place for the annual general meeting of the the union in january. And i was.

169
00:16:26,31 --> 00:16:34,69
We had the support of cole james from the acting school at the university of sydney and.

170
00:16:34,69 --> 00:16:38,66
A spectacle of the telephone long distance saying i'm having the luck call.

171
00:16:38,66 --> 00:16:45,62
And he says yes and we're running out of time because cold. Sort of it offered to sort of do the stock design police.

172
00:16:45,62 --> 00:16:48,33
Students on designing the side to the festival.

173
00:16:48,33 --> 00:16:53,16
And he said well maybe we're looking in the wrong direction maybe we should be looking at the town because if it's.

174
00:16:53,16 --> 00:16:56,38
This like that that the cost of putting in the infrastructure of roads and telephones

175
00:16:56,38 --> 00:17:00,5
and pad all that kind of stuff is going to be enormous and we don't really have it together.

176
00:17:00,5 --> 00:17:06,84
So when we think about looking for a village we could do something that has a show ground that we can buy stuff on.

177
00:17:06,84 --> 00:17:11,66
And he would know. I've been driving through this place called niman which is really pretty.

178
00:17:11,66 --> 00:17:18,28
And it's got lots of empty shops. And hospital and. Looks pretty good.

179
00:17:18,77 --> 00:17:23,59
So i went and made inquiries and made contact with the show society an image.

180
00:17:23,59 --> 00:17:30,13
Is that the first port of call and they said we're interested and. We had a meeting. Famous meeting.

181
00:17:30,13 --> 00:17:40,16
Called james came up from sydney. And. We we raised the time to meeting women. And the executive of the.

182
00:17:40,16 --> 00:17:46,7
The management committee the name of an agriculture and industrial show society. Society.

183
00:17:46,7 --> 00:17:52,65
The agricultural and industrial society of member and. Were collected around the woman more in the main street.

184
00:17:52,65 --> 00:17:57,5
And we approached from the south end of the main street. And walked up the middle of the road.

185
00:17:57,5 --> 00:18:02,79
Met them in the middle of the. High noon and. I mean that we were able to do those things that.

186
00:18:02,79 --> 00:18:09,18
Five pm in the afternoon. In the in the because there's very little traffic in the streets. And.

187
00:18:09,18 --> 00:18:15,94
And we went i think we would step in the pack. We're back to them. The park behind the war memorial.

188
00:18:16,77 --> 00:18:22,86
And they had their position was that they were interested in the idea of hosting a festival. And.

189
00:18:22,86 --> 00:18:25,73
But they thought it was a major decision. In the town.

190
00:18:25,73 --> 00:18:31,45
It should be go from the station so it was agreed that we'd have a public meeting and.

191
00:18:31,45 --> 00:18:35,88
So we set the date and we booked the whole. Went away and then we came back again for the public meeting.

192
00:18:36,55 --> 00:18:42,92
Did all the publicity we called our way and. I think it was near the middle like.

193
00:18:42,92 --> 00:18:48,83
November and nine hundred seventy two. We had them.

194
00:18:48,83 --> 00:18:56,82
A public meeting we came from all around the place we made it a focal point. Full. Planning the festival.

195
00:18:56,82 --> 00:19:05,84
And people came down from brisbane people came across from ahmed al. And sydney and. We came mooney.

196
00:19:05,84 --> 00:19:13,41
I mean people from the. The dig a newspaper in melbourne came up to to watch it to see this public me.

197
00:19:13,41 --> 00:19:17,78
And i derive a couple of days early.

198
00:19:17,78 --> 00:19:24,46
And spent the day of the festival going around and distributing the pamphlets about meeting

199
00:19:24,46 --> 00:19:31,95
and talking to many people i could personally. So that when we got to the meeting room about.

200
00:19:31,95 --> 00:19:42,22
Probably recall about two hundred people. In the town hall and women. And it was an extraordinary meeting.

201
00:19:42,22 --> 00:19:47,45
Basically as we attracted a lot of extraordinary people to come to the meeting for example.

202
00:19:47,66 --> 00:19:50,41
The guy called boma parea who.

203
00:19:50,41 --> 00:19:59,72
At that time was organizing a group called hopper which was a kind of a theatre group come. Concert organizing group.

204
00:19:59,72 --> 00:20:00,95
And whole food supply.

205
00:20:02,13 --> 00:20:04,77
Associated with the university of queensland they had to shut off the campus

206
00:20:04,77 --> 00:20:08,24
but they used to organize their events on the campus.

207
00:20:09,84 --> 00:20:15,94
And i would approach them to see if they'd be interested sitting at the food cooperated this part of the fistful. And.

208
00:20:16,8 --> 00:20:22,59
Bowman is an extraordinary guy an extraordinary performer he went on to these a performer his own robin went on to sort

209
00:20:22,59 --> 00:20:29,02
of produce the. Applying for thoughts that is that all. We don't get and his great.

210
00:20:29,02 --> 00:20:33,54
Lone frizzy hair and sort of the glasses in there or a wry grin.

211
00:20:33,54 --> 00:20:38,23
And he was there a printing room with a plastic millet. Right.

212
00:20:38,23 --> 00:20:41,45
So he's in full performance and if anyone showed any disaffection

213
00:20:41,45 --> 00:20:47,17
or grumpiness the volm would creep up behind him give him a bump on the head. So that you know.

214
00:20:47,85 --> 00:20:54,38
Laughter was produced by also showed one of the sixteen millimeter movies that they made which consisted of students

215
00:20:54,38 --> 00:20:59,57
who these guys are running around with put a paper. Behind. You know. Streams of toilet paper.

216
00:20:59,57 --> 00:21:00,89
I hadn't seen the movie for a show

217
00:21:00,89 --> 00:21:05,87
and was trying to sort of an example of the kind of films we teach i'm totally incomprehensible myself

218
00:21:05,87 --> 00:21:12,07
and have it in him and people. But there was it just a feeling of goodwill. That this was an exciting bunch of people.

219
00:21:12,07 --> 00:21:15,44
And the music because we had live music we perform for them.

220
00:21:15,44 --> 00:21:19,88
It was going to say that this was going to be something special something different.

221
00:21:19,88 --> 00:21:23,07
So we had a tremendous amount of goodwill. Generated.

222
00:21:23,07 --> 00:21:30,56
And also we had the support of the local policeman bob and bob mush was a policeman with a good heart

223
00:21:30,56 --> 00:21:38,26
and he was concerned about the economic downturn. Of nieman. The at the that the time of the festival the school.

224
00:21:38,26 --> 00:21:43,19
The central school was threatened with downgrading was going to become a primary school so even the people in the.

225
00:21:43,19 --> 00:21:46,52
You know just. The thirty's of high school would have to travel is more.

226
00:21:46,52 --> 00:21:49,45
They were talking about closing the hospital which.

227
00:21:49,45 --> 00:21:53,05
You know than even community and work so hard to create and build in the first place.

228
00:21:54,77 --> 00:22:00,05
And so that the pensioners and the all people living the town would have to travel to lease more for the services.

229
00:22:00,05 --> 00:22:07,23
And bob is a bit of an entrepreneur they had on the saudi had a sort of restock a pet food business they used to

230
00:22:07,23 --> 00:22:11,87
recycle the caucus is in the area and did cows and did. The listens.

231
00:22:11,87 --> 00:22:15,94
And he wanted to see move into price develop in him and so he was. When we say well look.

232
00:22:16,34 --> 00:22:18,23
You queers festival put this town on the map

233
00:22:18,23 --> 00:22:23,64
and you'll certainly get a lot of young people moving back he was like totally supportive of the idea.

234
00:22:23,64 --> 00:22:26,79
Any think that helped regenerate him and it was going to support.

235
00:22:26,79 --> 00:22:29,03
So he didn't attend the meeting but he wrote a letter.

236
00:22:29,03 --> 00:22:36,58
You know to the fist of all it to the meeting which was read aloud and it was. Had a great impact.

237
00:22:36,58 --> 00:22:38,05
The impact of the head on.

238
00:22:38,05 --> 00:22:43,58
What must his career as a policeman was also that spirit was kind of drummed out of the police force of being so

239
00:22:43,58 --> 00:22:52,43
outspoken. And as the book. And the big question was asked of course inevitably what about drugs and them.

240
00:22:52,82 --> 00:22:58,4
We all remember saying at the time that the queerest festival was not a sunday school picnic.

241
00:22:58,4 --> 00:23:01,79
We're talking about university students here and.

242
00:23:01,79 --> 00:23:07,86
And that marijuana allusions were part of the culture there's no way we could prevent that.

243
00:23:07,86 --> 00:23:12,61
Being present at the festival and. The vote was taken with.

244
00:23:12,61 --> 00:23:18,00
You know it was like almost unanimous there are only a handful of people i would say no more than six people who voted

245
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:27,74
against having the festival. So we were. Triumphant. Take that down south to the. To the meeting.

246
00:23:27,74 --> 00:23:33,67
The annual meeting of the straining union students and out a job was then to get the money for the budget.

247
00:23:33,67 --> 00:23:39,19
You know to get a budget. As a major event. For the student finances.

248
00:23:39,4 --> 00:23:47,15
Well that was the most amazing event in it so you can imagine that there are lots of. Demands lots.

249
00:23:47,15 --> 00:23:56,48
Being put on the budget of the straining union of students and. We worked at it we would allow.

250
00:23:56,48 --> 00:24:01,44
Entertainers in singers and dancers and the like house stuff and we did them a spectacular presentation.

251
00:24:01,48 --> 00:24:07,02
I remember i wore a dress. And the spotless.

252
00:24:07,26 --> 00:24:15,19
I've met people since the late eighty's were in melbourne i met a guy in an advertising agency that all your gram

253
00:24:15,19 --> 00:24:20,22
dunston. Are. Remember i was that sort of. You know with the hind the a is.

254
00:24:20,22 --> 00:24:25,73
Student politician we're going to my thirst destroying union students conference and you did this amazing presentation.

255
00:24:25,87 --> 00:24:27,97
It's the best presentation of ever saying up.

256
00:24:27,97 --> 00:24:32,49
Always want when i do presentations my clients are always trying to emulate.

257
00:24:32,49 --> 00:24:32,94
The flair

258
00:24:32,94 --> 00:24:40,07
and possess of the prison that in any way what what happened was that we we knocked their socks off basically and.

259
00:24:40,07 --> 00:24:44,95
We had total support for the festival and we had got through with an open ended bunch of.

260
00:24:44,95 --> 00:24:49,83
Of a we had something like twenty thousand dollars in notting seventy three money.

261
00:24:49,83 --> 00:24:55,11
To produce this money but by see it was open ended we could do whatever we needed to do to get this festival happening.

262
00:24:55,11 --> 00:25:06,79
Which we went away and did. So. Having got the money and the responsibilities were again split. Johnny on did them.

263
00:25:07,86 --> 00:25:12,63
The spruiking he was. Took the job on of going round two straight talking up the fist of all.

264
00:25:12,63 --> 00:25:27,8
And i had the job of sort of getting the side organized in women and sort of preparing the town for..

265
00:25:19,7 --> 00:25:27,51
The strategy we adopted for the publisher he was to work through the. The student papers and. We got h.

266
00:25:27,8 --> 00:25:30,85
With the student papers at the major campuses to give us and.

267
00:25:30,85 --> 00:25:37,57
In addition of the paper which was the principal used in seventy one and. Have a guest editor i mean and.

268
00:25:38,86 --> 00:25:44,47
We filled the. The paper with stories about people who coming to the festival.

269
00:25:44,47 --> 00:25:47,84
People giving their rides about the future so we had.

270
00:25:47,84 --> 00:25:56,13
Called james talking about alternative architecture and low low energy. Houses noise kind of stuff.

271
00:25:56,13 --> 00:26:03,06
And organic gardening and. You know. So it was always a fascinating a riot of ideas being presented.

272
00:26:03,95 --> 00:26:12,2
And because we never really we had posters funded by the peta status and foundation. Is a bit of an irony at the time.

273
00:26:12,73 --> 00:26:18,11
And they never funded the eucharist foundation again after they found out. The festival is about.

274
00:26:18,11 --> 00:26:25,87
But basically we didn't use any of the established media we didn't advertise in any of them in the media the.

275
00:26:25,87 --> 00:26:31,97
Television radio. The press. And it was only. It was a very successful campaign we said.

276
00:26:31,97 --> 00:26:36,98
You know a publishing deal that the word of the festival would be carried on the lips of the counterculture the people

277
00:26:36,98 --> 00:26:43,21
who were really interested in these ideas would tell their friends and then get together to come. And i remember.

278
00:26:43,21 --> 00:26:44,98
People scoffing about this and.

279
00:26:44,98 --> 00:26:47,97
There is a danger because people carry negative messages much more readily

280
00:26:47,97 --> 00:26:52,22
and then there's the positive ones they've got to keep the divide really really high.

281
00:26:52,22 --> 00:26:59,1
But it was only about three weeks before the festival when the first articles. Peed in the sitting room here old.

282
00:26:59,1 --> 00:27:02,54
Acknowledging that something strange was happening in him and something extraordinary is happening.

283
00:27:02,54 --> 00:27:07,22
Like that you know the word is out the name of the place to go to.

284
00:27:07,22 --> 00:27:13,76
So it's a very successful campaign to court the established. Precise unawares.

285
00:27:13,76 --> 00:27:17,28
And johnny allen was going around australia.

286
00:27:17,28 --> 00:27:21,95
Talking these things up he was assisted by a theatre group that he put together called the white company.

287
00:27:21,95 --> 00:27:32,05
Which did the same thing in song and dance and sing anthems and create the mood. Some of them. We used to. I mean.

288
00:27:32,38 --> 00:27:40,51
When the systems we were always faced with the ritual would burn some incense and sort of. Essential oils on.

289
00:27:40,51 --> 00:27:47,77
Chalk all kinds. If you dealing with those who have a big temple. You know. It's sort of.

290
00:27:47,77 --> 00:27:52,79
It was easier with a breathable amount of incense who i mean we did it in the open.

291
00:27:52,79 --> 00:27:58,66
In joan pinned it was the thought of the jumping the from the last laugh. Tell them oh.

292
00:27:58,66 --> 00:28:09,25
It's going to be on the control we actually had to leave the house. Billowy incidence got a good thing about it.

293
00:28:09,25 --> 00:28:15,94
And the other think got out of control was the white company or totally inspirational but there were all.

294
00:28:16,61 --> 00:28:23,2
All had their individual performance trips. There are lots of vegas begin. Sort of bouncing. Of each other and.

295
00:28:24,15 --> 00:28:28,65
Towards the end of the two are they got more and more interested in primal scream therapy.

296
00:28:29,99 --> 00:28:39,36
The object of the exercise was to convey to people feeling for the festival and. It was the end of the.

297
00:28:39,36 --> 00:28:40,5
What kept his promotion.

298
00:28:40,5 --> 00:28:48,79
The feeling of fist it was this one's primal scream this is for who exactly is going around school really.

299
00:28:48,79 --> 00:28:52,25
Had my doubts about whether the successful promotion at the end but.

300
00:28:52,25 --> 00:29:01,22
We got the agony and the what kept me were fantastic. So. Meanwhile back in women.

301
00:29:01,22 --> 00:29:10,48
The wood got out and we started up a food kitchen. Which we called the rainbow cafe and. We offered very one.

302
00:29:10,48 --> 00:29:15,64
We couldn't afford to pay for people. Anyone who wanted to work on the preparation the festival. Come along.

303
00:29:15,64 --> 00:29:26,73
And we would three them mixed into the labor. And in the beginning this worked wonderfully and. Yes we we printed some.

304
00:29:26,73 --> 00:29:31,78
Some money and called women braids and. An exchange has a name and braid.

305
00:29:31,78 --> 00:29:37,13
If you work the vest and you paid him in bread you get your food at nine.

306
00:29:37,13 --> 00:29:45,84
And the rainbow cafe itself every evening was like. A wonderland of entertainment. And i would sit around with.

307
00:29:45,84 --> 00:29:53,79
You know who was set on the floor and low tables. One of the early. Kind of cultural impact on women was at least.

308
00:29:53,79 --> 00:30:02,86
We savage tables with the counter table. Going to cut its legs off. It was a fashion that.

309
00:30:02,86 --> 00:30:06,86
We sit on the floor and we did together and then we'd have a talk about the progress of the festival

310
00:30:06,86 --> 00:30:09,36
and then we'd seen in every night.

311
00:30:09,36 --> 00:30:12,4
You know they'd be a new group of people arriving in town these triple doors

312
00:30:12,4 --> 00:30:15,94
and we would be blown up by the lightest performance or that the lightest.

313
00:30:16,21 --> 00:30:19,07
Right if the people would come and say they want to do.

314
00:30:19,07 --> 00:30:23,03
It was a magical place and the reputation of the rainbow cafes sort of.

315
00:30:23,03 --> 00:30:28,16
The cafe of the universe was sort of built in that his days.

316
00:30:28,16 --> 00:30:32,84
And what happened for me as an organizer with it and this was wonderful payoff of the.

317
00:30:32,84 --> 00:30:40,37
Local newman community and we used. Used to invite. Local business people and residents. To come dine with us.

318
00:30:40,37 --> 00:30:45,33
Of course they would be blown out because we usually finish with a dance everyone dancing together

319
00:30:45,33 --> 00:30:50,82
and hollering handle this kind of stuff and. Wonderful uplifting.

320
00:30:50,82 --> 00:30:54,57
Spiritual experiences these when they would go back until the friends and neighbors

321
00:30:54,57 --> 00:31:00,95
and we had extraordinary good will in the beginning. It was like magic in the streets.

322
00:31:00,95 --> 00:31:07,66
There was a woman who arrived in the village called margaret sullivan. Margaret was an irish.

323
00:31:07,66 --> 00:31:09,79
Singer touring a straighter at the time.

324
00:31:09,79 --> 00:31:13,88
And she was going north and she decided to do two of our name and because you'd heard about this place

325
00:31:13,88 --> 00:31:18,14
and hopped out of the cab. And stayed for seventies.

326
00:31:19,64 --> 00:31:26,81
And she became a welcomer so that any new face that arrived in town was you know margaret would go and introduce him

327
00:31:26,81 --> 00:31:31,28
and find a place for miss kind of stuff and she was also a liaison officer.

328
00:31:31,28 --> 00:31:34,34
So you go and talk to the residents and find out their concerns and.
