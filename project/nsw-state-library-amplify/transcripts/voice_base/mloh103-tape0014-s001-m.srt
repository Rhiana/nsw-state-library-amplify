1
00:00:16,87 --> 00:00:25,33
I'm place like the laughing mean like i am i don't know.

2
00:00:25,33 --> 00:00:32,86
I am i'm just sort of was the element i wouldn't among them to grow up anywhere else probably because this is a

3
00:00:32,86 --> 00:00:47,04
benevolent and. We had not travelled with them. So he's exposed to.

4
00:00:47,04 --> 00:00:50,75
Well one of the real of the real things i would have been exposed to was drugs.

5
00:00:50,75 --> 00:00:58,41
But not at that festival tone that was lighter. So to be nice to come out on my side that.

6
00:00:58,41 --> 00:01:05,2
Up until i actually left time and then came back that i would never offered drugs.

7
00:01:05,2 --> 00:01:08,76
And i wouldn't you know had to stop they had but truth

8
00:01:08,76 --> 00:01:15,13
or lies he's a plain young students he is i would never have offered drugs by anybody. But by brad.

9
00:01:15,13 --> 00:01:29,88
They were and i knew that i ran up there. I think just. Well. I've been lucky. There was a lot of strange paper.

10
00:01:29,88 --> 00:01:38,92
That sort of taught them that i had to be very careful of who i talk to a food i got to know so that sort of mad them

11
00:01:38,92 --> 00:01:47,22
or that much better in their logs at the news that you know if you didn't trust anybody everybody.

12
00:01:47,22 --> 00:01:50,57
But then again requested.

13
00:01:50,57 --> 00:01:56,6
We were lucky we had yeah people would come into the past

14
00:01:56,6 --> 00:02:03,34
and that sort of things that i sort of grew up with the blood starts of the fates you know we were

15
00:02:03,34 --> 00:02:10,00
when we went to paradise valley and had dinner with friends out there that we've got to now.

16
00:02:10,00 --> 00:02:15,19
We had people come here off the communes to have meals with us we find a tangible and took the children with.

17
00:02:18,28 --> 00:02:23,09
That's why i think i got to know that there was a muslim just the right law and in life that.

18
00:02:23,09 --> 00:02:25,6
There was too so it's do iton.

19
00:02:25,6 --> 00:02:40,58
And bad so it's could be quite pleasant if you get it down to the two girls of the two girls sleeping his in his mum.

20
00:02:40,58 --> 00:02:48,52
But the married and i've went in there leave and never the four lot. Two husbands and the two walks us.

21
00:02:48,52 --> 00:03:00,9
Got jobs in these memos that. They caught happy leaving them behind with the sky because she's at college and.

22
00:03:00,9 --> 00:03:08,39
That was her choice that she you know. And that she wanted to have a bright a life from newman.

23
00:03:08,39 --> 00:03:14,1
She was probably the one with whom she doesn't know the other saw the name because she was born.

24
00:03:14,1 --> 00:03:25,82
I stayed in the oldest and. Bipolar rock in the. So she and i sort of mean then as it is now not as a boss before.

25
00:03:25,82 --> 00:03:32,67
That was probably the other thing that was a fear from me was before the fist of when your kids could be waianae out

26
00:03:32,67 --> 00:03:39,52
and you knew that that were the talking to her or not to learn our friend. Where if they were gone for ten minutes.

27
00:03:39,52 --> 00:03:48,04
You were concerned as you know that you know when a rabbi who's got them. And. Because that was a.

28
00:03:48,04 --> 00:03:53,29
I fear for my personally having stray young children away before that.

29
00:03:53,29 --> 00:03:56,97
That was probably a different name been from my that.

30
00:03:56,97 --> 00:04:03,4
Before the festival of my children could be gone for an hour up destroyed. After that if i was gone for five minutes.

31
00:04:03,4 --> 00:04:15,19
Would be countess i with i want my life in that respect. That i had to be more aware where my children were than i was.

32
00:04:15,46 --> 00:04:33,84
Before on young people on drugs. It would have to be you know i know i said this man it's in the moment.

33
00:04:33,84 --> 00:04:42,53
I think the opposite i've got a lot of fond memories of the festival and after that. That would have to pay.

34
00:04:42,53 --> 00:04:47,86
I think the saddest thing that i had to say is you know. I thought been blown away i thought drugs.

35
00:04:47,86 --> 00:04:58,03
And it would be the talk of random overlap and so i come on we're going to get right out of life in this.

36
00:04:58,03 --> 00:05:15,3
It would have to be the thing that i would judge him in that. Yes that it wasn't the festival.

37
00:05:15,3 --> 00:05:21,48
Now i wouldn't side that not the heavy stuff.

38
00:05:21,48 --> 00:05:28,21
After the first or when i think we found little pops of marijuana growing. But there was what. Ran the blood.

39
00:05:28,21 --> 00:05:39,9
But we're probably having a smart. A ram. That's their business and that is their consent. But i think.

40
00:05:39,9 --> 00:05:41,6
Then it came to dealing.

41
00:05:41,6 --> 00:05:48,77
But i think that's probably any happened sort of scientists are nice the last ten years where we've got the deal are

42
00:05:48,77 --> 00:05:53,13
coming into town and. And that sort of thing we have in mind.

43
00:05:53,13 --> 00:06:00,37
That's the sign was anything else a surprise if you've just got it right we're going to have are our cigarette of

44
00:06:00,37 --> 00:06:05,7
marijuana or whatever the i call it. That is their business.

45
00:06:05,7 --> 00:06:11,87
But i do think that alone should be drawn somewhere that people are selling it to other people's children.

46
00:06:11,87 --> 00:06:15,19
That that is a very big.

47
00:06:15,65 --> 00:06:24,08
Concern ammonia and said i don't know what i would have done had heart of sort of had them offering it to moan

48
00:06:24,08 --> 00:06:31,12
but i can side that. It never happened until now it's happening that they've gone by and they're coming back on.

49
00:06:31,12 --> 00:06:39,05
And my ass sort of rising up to them now in the straight and sighing. They want to bow out but up until then.

50
00:06:39,05 --> 00:06:40,93
It was never offered to them but.

51
00:06:40,93 --> 00:06:51,13
That would be not saddest thing about naman is that it is that they are not so young logs being destroyed bill at those

52
00:06:51,13 --> 00:06:57,59
who do not know couldn't say i have. But i think.

53
00:06:57,59 --> 00:07:04,7
If you leave here and in such a small community yes it touches you personally just to say. Anyone's child.

54
00:07:04,7 --> 00:07:16,35
You can stand back and side well. I don't care because you do care. And i'm not just sad. You know.

55
00:07:16,35 --> 00:07:24,42
It is it's really and truly sad to say it because some of those kids up there are so young and i think if we you know.

56
00:07:24,42 --> 00:07:28,91
Just like to say the deal is for it. I can align all. I'm sure would be that.

57
00:07:28,91 --> 00:07:34,06
That is their problem then we've got it and no i don't know. I don't know how to fix it.

58
00:07:34,06 --> 00:07:38,75
And i think that's the agra biting pad up at the you darn i had to fix it yourself

59
00:07:38,75 --> 00:07:51,85
and you don't know if anyone else can fix today that you know for sure. I think i think it.

60
00:07:51,85 --> 00:07:59,45
It is just that now i had to do was that any of us. You know we can talk about it and so i will.

61
00:07:59,45 --> 00:08:05,23
And i suppose we can also the tron blind mother paper for it but that's not fixing it is that. You know. And we dug.

62
00:08:05,23 --> 00:08:12,57
That's what i know i think that is why we do try and pass the blind on this one all that mana someone else inside.

63
00:08:12,57 --> 00:08:17,91
If we didn't have a festival to put in the pap and if we do. Can do this so that what.

64
00:08:17,91 --> 00:08:19,76
Wouldn't happen but it's happened.

65
00:08:19,76 --> 00:08:29,1
And that's not the point we brought up and we just sat helpless we didn't know what to do a battle.

66
00:08:29,1 --> 00:08:32,97
We will never be able to fix it i don't know.

67
00:08:32,97 --> 00:08:49,58
But it is a concern that would have to be not because that really my saddest thing about leaving newman and saying it.

68
00:08:49,58 --> 00:08:58,68
No i just think living in new haven is right. A life has been good.

69
00:08:58,68 --> 00:09:05,22
And it's because i live up to our good has been a bad. Read trait. Beautiful children and.

70
00:09:05,22 --> 00:09:13,89
I've had a good job i work with good paper and i so the lock in general has been good and i force that. And i think.

71
00:09:13,89 --> 00:09:30,1
And i don't think i could have been happier if i'd lived anywhere outside. In them. Surprise. What is it you know.

72
00:09:30,1 --> 00:09:41,01
Not really. And i just think it's. Neiman's name been and then think up with well.

73
00:09:41,01 --> 00:09:48,11
I had this fraud but it's just it's got a. There's a cad to it but not to say it if you haven't got a sense of p.m.u.

74
00:09:48,11 --> 00:09:56,36
Deadly feel. You've got a very prepared to be apt to laugh at things if you take not serious and human is not for you.

75
00:09:56,36 --> 00:10:01,45
That's not your place of that documents iow you believe do you do you think god guess i am going to sense.

76
00:10:01,45 --> 00:10:15,19
The i'm forgetting. Now. You know really i mean i haven't got a funny story and i think. I've got.

77
00:10:15,7 --> 00:10:19,24
Really you know i'd have to think about it the could be lots of funny things that happened.

78
00:10:19,24 --> 00:10:23,45
In my life that you could like that

79
00:10:23,45 --> 00:10:31,45
but nothing comes to mind i think is probably what i'll probably during the first of

80
00:10:31,45 --> 00:10:36,61
when i didn't run down the street but not have a bobbing along you know especially not the bet that is

81
00:10:36,61 --> 00:10:50,59
but it's nothing really it's lots of funny things that happened.

82
00:10:50,59 --> 00:10:54,77
I've anything in particular that i could sort of cyber yes that was probably

83
00:10:54,77 --> 00:11:25,73
when you've gone out i know you're telling that story but you know. Thank you. Oh well. I'm charlie said and.

84
00:11:25,73 --> 00:11:40,63
I was very very busy doing the first festival i mean i was unable to go on and. I have such a full column job.

85
00:11:40,63 --> 00:11:57,31
Miking the street. Preventable and claim enough for everyone and. The total job was a. Quite a handful and.

86
00:11:57,31 --> 00:12:10,23
On have a bit of other. Care securities to do. Be sawed up at my lady or. My only more fold i would tighten up with.

87
00:12:10,23 --> 00:12:15,19
Just looking off to the straight and the. Particularly the garbage.

88
00:12:15,23 --> 00:12:39,45
So much of what you read my memories back over the festival and yeah. I'm not quite such a. Quite a few.

89
00:12:39,45 --> 00:12:49,36
Norse new people that kind and. Quite a few of them are still here.

90
00:12:49,36 --> 00:13:00,39
Why are there look to most of those who want to leave here and do the right thing that they're not really happy with.

91
00:13:00,39 --> 00:13:10,3
Having another festival. So i say yeah. I think i might feel.

92
00:13:10,3 --> 00:13:46,41
This quite a lot goes on that shouldn't be going on and i not might not feel happy about it you. You must know. You.

93
00:13:46,41 --> 00:13:54,27
Well if i know as much as i certainly would have been very much of a guy i said.

94
00:13:54,27 --> 00:14:05,11
Because for so many things went on of particularly the way people walk from.

95
00:14:05,11 --> 00:14:15,19
Choir this in the cradle quite additions walking from where they lived and came to.

96
00:14:16,37 --> 00:14:33,22
Share rooms in that i mean it didn't matter who you were or what you were i. I walked completely on kind of and.

97
00:14:33,22 --> 00:14:37,51
At least australian like with a bit of tile.

98
00:14:37,51 --> 00:14:51,66
And some of the other places that some of the tents and things that they're going to walk past well where mum

99
00:14:51,66 --> 00:15:09,62
and dad was leading the way of course i promptly stopped and turned the children back the other way i

100
00:15:09,62 --> 00:15:23,2
or so they wouldn't say what was going on in the team. Yeah. I changed the direction and.

101
00:15:23,2 --> 00:15:41,37
It was so much happening to happen then. In the drug needling pot. Where there were so many so many used needles.

102
00:15:41,37 --> 00:15:56,48
Even lying a bath and working in the dump ever seems well. It was no.

103
00:15:56,48 --> 00:16:05,22
It was no problem at all who lay there we were trying to claim that. Claim the dump and wait so i can live.

104
00:16:05,22 --> 00:16:07,86
And he could come across.

105
00:16:07,86 --> 00:16:15,19
I don't know and he was in one place without any trouble and move on a bit further and come across more.

106
00:16:16,14 --> 00:16:19,61
Still with the needle in them.

107
00:16:19,61 --> 00:16:25,66
It would have been a very risky thing to wave

108
00:16:25,66 --> 00:16:39,11
and put your hands over for you to any way any of the neighbors what you didn't know was already there.

109
00:16:39,11 --> 00:16:45,86
That was all first of all talk on the other. It's been the.

110
00:16:45,86 --> 00:16:56,29
You're just being a simon till just recently when they dumped us. A chinese hands a bit for recycling people.

111
00:16:56,29 --> 00:17:10,23
But the neighborhood. Right up until just recently. And as i got there.

112
00:17:10,23 --> 00:17:17,21
Times for a bit of recycling even at the showground well.

113
00:17:17,21 --> 00:17:31,21
There's plenty of an aide was left just anywhere at the showground. And i'd be oddly very much a guy just a festival.

114
00:17:31,21 --> 00:17:41,03
Restarting like it was then because it's risky even walking a bit now and.

115
00:17:41,03 --> 00:17:45,48
What will it be like with or with a bigger crowd.

116
00:17:45,48 --> 00:18:07,23
And the drugged out ever same to them so just like i know plenty of free to be just as many months now as it was one

117
00:18:07,23 --> 00:18:33,49
thing. I just. Not of anything really that. What real good the first of all did do.

118
00:18:33,49 --> 00:18:50,45
And i knew him when he was so small and. Probably yelling back. But it has brought business and that into him.

119
00:18:50,45 --> 00:19:02,12
But when so many very rough and. You lie about people.

120
00:19:02,12 --> 00:19:07,04
You've got a job even to work on the straight because there are so many.

121
00:19:07,04 --> 00:19:08,85
They sit around her lying around

122
00:19:08,85 --> 00:19:19,61
and i doubt even mike room for all these two would clear particularly for the stroller or.

123
00:19:19,61 --> 00:19:32,46
Shopping shopping trolley ok.d. Stroller or not there's billy room to get past them.

124
00:19:32,46 --> 00:19:37,1
Or cut or concepts down a really lot of good.

125
00:19:37,1 --> 00:20:10,17
A lot of good when in doubt you you i did find there were some very good musicians among the. The new set list and.

126
00:20:10,17 --> 00:20:31,5
Very very talented in music and. Sometimes i quite often join them. I do a lot of singing.

127
00:20:31,5 --> 00:20:42,21
And i still do it at seventy no seventy nine and some tell me all kinds of people are like me the come along

128
00:20:42,21 --> 00:22:32,24
and sing while i do the banking and. I really enjoy it but i just can't think of any special. Time i had with them.

129
00:22:32,24 --> 00:22:32,24
Occasionally though. Not so long back i performed on the nimbin show ground and.

130
00:22:32,24 --> 00:22:32,24
I joined in with them and quite a few times with leather and.

131
00:22:32,24 --> 00:22:32,24
General public in general really enjoyed a couple of special times i can remember with them.

132
00:22:32,24 --> 00:22:44,12
But some of the songs that. With people if they don't know them. If they don't know them themselves like.

133
00:22:44,12 --> 00:22:53,14
I have music and they can follow them but why. Some of them are quite up to date.

134
00:22:53,14 --> 00:23:04,89
Country western songs such as one day the time and place help me on falling in.

135
00:23:04,89 --> 00:23:22,94
The girl dies here die and also the pearly shells and i usually say here comes the name

136
00:23:22,94 --> 00:23:34,97
and by a law i was in the telling was. There's only one but a lot of us. And on very happy that.

137
00:23:34,97 --> 00:23:43,33
If i sound like you but i'm not you either try and labor has really i mean one

138
00:23:43,33 --> 00:23:56,45
or thought i can do the other the good ol laurie songs or the oldies all in general.

139
00:23:56,45 --> 00:24:16,65
The bing crosby's go i buy produce at one time don't know if anyone wants gospel songs will they come to the right

140
00:24:16,65 --> 00:24:30,85
place because i like and sadly sadly handle the gospel. I'm doing it regular at the moment in the way.

141
00:24:31,21 --> 00:24:39,1
All the local churches. Went to sydney recently.

142
00:24:39,1 --> 00:24:47,21
Graeme souness wearing the the man there was saying a special one for his wedding with so i did.

143
00:24:47,21 --> 00:24:56,2
And i was just coming back from a lovely weekend in intent of saying

144
00:24:56,2 --> 00:25:09,93
and who attend the first ever plus three other three other avenues

145
00:25:09,93 --> 00:25:33,43
or the three new citizens with five things songs in three that i so i think about coming home for all of that i guess.

146
00:25:33,43 --> 00:25:38,94
We don't just stop. Yes.

147
00:25:41,62 --> 00:25:45,71
So it is a

148
00:25:45,71 --> 00:25:53,79
and i was in one hundred seventy three i was in oh i'm don johnston in back in nine hundred seventy three

149
00:25:53,79 --> 00:26:01,5
when the aquarius festival was mooted i was our idea we farm here at bishop's creek which is near noon been and.

150
00:26:01,5 --> 00:26:05,93
I was also and. I can plot on the terrain is your council.

151
00:26:05,93 --> 00:26:10,97
Which later become amalgamated with a little more city council. We did my guy.

152
00:26:10,97 --> 00:26:18,38
Decision back in seventy two just before the course first of all to allow the festival. To be held in him been.

153
00:26:19,22 --> 00:26:28,31
And that's about a five on concern the situation would have possibly been that there were only three or four. Did.

154
00:26:28,31 --> 00:26:30,85
Object to the yard. At the public meeting.

155
00:26:31,11 --> 00:26:38,02
That they shouldn't have their careers first of all the rest of nimbin seem to be going along with it.

156
00:26:38,02 --> 00:26:42,95
So that's where they train each our council made the decision to allow to be held and.

157
00:26:44,3 --> 00:26:48,79
Looking back in those days or feel would only one thing that we should have done.

158
00:26:48,79 --> 00:26:58,03
And that was probably to put our bigger bond. On the festival. Committee because the clean up program.

159
00:26:58,03 --> 00:27:09,07
Looked a lot to be desired in the trying to assure our council had to pick up the tab for it. Yes i was around.

160
00:27:09,07 --> 00:27:13,00
For all of the festival. I was also president of the nimbin bowling club.

161
00:27:13,73 --> 00:27:22,89
And they first of all was right beside it and. My wife was heavily committed to our church organization.

162
00:27:22,89 --> 00:27:29,55
Having me also our soups and and teas and running other for the people who were visiting the festival.

163
00:27:30,46 --> 00:27:33,98
And so i was committed. Every day and every night.

164
00:27:33,98 --> 00:27:39,29
At the club and help helping organizations and even taking in the some of the visitors.

165
00:27:39,29 --> 00:27:49,32
To their camps and one another during the not. It was different it was most certainly different.

166
00:27:51,29 --> 00:27:56,56
I feel that the young people most of the young people that were there.

167
00:27:56,56 --> 00:28:02,67
Didn't really understand what they were there for. That was my first impression of a lot of the people.

168
00:28:02,67 --> 00:28:06,42
But they certainly enjoyed themselves for those ten days that they were there.

169
00:28:06,42 --> 00:28:15,43
And most certainly they were helped by everyone in name and to try to join in and be part of it.

170
00:28:17,52 --> 00:28:27,18
These are some of the funny thoughts were probably the first time that we saw in a lot of people getting around with no

171
00:28:27,18 --> 00:28:40,86
clothes on. Even in fairly. Populated streets and money another.

172
00:28:41,36 --> 00:28:48,68
I don't think too many took a great deal another stop it. But i do believe that some of the things and.

173
00:28:48,68 --> 00:28:51,74
One of the things that have come from what i believe.

174
00:28:51,74 --> 00:28:57,93
Was a presence of drugs they are doing now that the local constabulary and i told them.

175
00:28:57,93 --> 00:29:03,27
Told the committee that they would not be hard on them if they only used soft drugs such as met marijuana.

176
00:29:03,27 --> 00:29:07,79
But one thing used hard drugs i would claim down on them which they did and.

177
00:29:07,79 --> 00:29:16,04
I can remember one distinct episode where i group of people. Could be number twelve or fifteen hundred.

178
00:29:16,04 --> 00:29:21,86
Got box cutters and. Cut the handcuffs off. A prisoner that i detected had.

179
00:29:27,45 --> 00:29:34,2
Not really very little fighting between themselves or with anyone else.

180
00:29:34,2 --> 00:29:37,75
It was a really good time there was lots of really good music.

181
00:29:37,75 --> 00:29:43,28
And a lot of good times for most of the people concerned or. There were they only those isolated.

182
00:29:43,28 --> 00:29:47,78
Actions that i believe i did did my right but not to any great extent.

183
00:29:53,36 --> 00:29:59,75
Well the good things i left i believe there are some very talented people in the area and.

184
00:29:59,75 --> 00:30:06,66
Probably stem from the aquarius festival or. Have got.

185
00:30:06,66 --> 00:30:13,89
Media coverage seems a lot of people with great talent in arts and crafts we have some very good craft shops

186
00:30:13,89 --> 00:30:22,58
and workshops in the village now that can be put down those. From the aquarius festival.

187
00:30:23,36 --> 00:30:30,85
There's also probably a lot of money. Being generated by the people there. Whether or not it's because of.

188
00:30:31,08 --> 00:30:33,18
Doll of because to be invalid pensions or whatever.

189
00:30:33,18 --> 00:30:40,46
But the result lot more money in nimbin at the present stage in the world back in not before not in seventy three.

190
00:30:44,57 --> 00:30:52,09
Yeah. Niman. Lot of people say it was i becoming a ghost town i don't believe that for one moment it was going through.

191
00:30:52,09 --> 00:31:04,00
What we'd call i probably a recession. It was just coming to the stage where we had some. Total of about one hundred.

192
00:31:04,00 --> 00:31:07,7
Dairy farms in the area. We had our own but affect tree.

193
00:31:07,7 --> 00:31:11,16
That will fill by the wayside that we're just trying to deteriorate.

194
00:31:11,68 --> 00:31:18,87
We had about four or five mills in the area one mill in a time. Had twenty id employees.

195
00:31:18,87 --> 00:31:23,09
And now we're back to one mill so yes there has been i decline in.

196
00:31:23,09 --> 00:31:27,1
Industry and i think that's the big problem that we've got in nimbin at the present stage.

197
00:31:27,1 --> 00:31:29,55
Not enough in industry and it.
