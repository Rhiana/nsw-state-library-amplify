00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,03
An expat is Andrew take.

2
00:00:02,62 --> 00:00:08,99
After eight years as a barrister followed by nineteen years as a member of the New South Wales they just dip assembly

3
00:00:09,74 --> 00:00:11,77
eleven of them on the front bench.

4
00:00:11,79 --> 00:00:19,9
Andrew tink stepped back from active politics in two thousand and seven to concentrate on writing Andrew's first book.

5
00:00:19,95 --> 00:00:27,18
William Charles Wentworth one day and I in IP I should say CIA away from the award for literature in two thousand

6
00:00:27,18 --> 00:00:31,99
and in the second law at Sydney was published in two thousand and eleven

7
00:00:32,95 --> 00:00:37,61
and he stood a disaster Cambra in two thousand and thirteen.

8
00:00:37,63 --> 00:00:41,68
Andrew slightest book a strike nineteen one to two thousand and one

9
00:00:41,68 --> 00:00:46,19
and narrative history was released in November two thousand and fourteen.

10
00:00:47,55 --> 00:00:55,02
Andrew is an edge on Professor University's Law School and a trustee of Sydney living museums in two thousand

11
00:00:55,02 --> 00:00:55,87
and thirteen.

12
00:00:56,06 --> 00:01:02,69
He was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters University and on the strategy I three thousand and fourteen.

13
00:01:03,05 --> 00:01:08,33
He was made a member of the Order of Australia in January two thousand and fifteen.

14
00:01:08,49 --> 00:01:15,49
Andrew commenced a three year appointment as president of the lottery Council the south while he's going to be talking

15
00:01:15,49 --> 00:01:22,07
to us the soft unknown on the subject of Magna Carta is round about relevance to early New South Wales

16
00:01:22,07 --> 00:01:34,66
and I'd ask you to welcome him. Thank. Thanks very much diverted. Look there's one thing too.

17
00:01:34,66 --> 00:01:37,27
I need to explain and that is so I've had radiation. That's right.

18
00:01:37,35 --> 00:01:47,53
Cancer and I get a very dry mouth so to drink from this bottle with on. But it can Times water not alcohol but.

19
00:01:47,55 --> 00:01:49,13
According to the Philosopher

20
00:01:49,13 --> 00:01:57,08
and jurist Jeremy Bentham the detention of what he called explored convicts in the colonies was a breach of Magna Carta

21
00:01:58,03 --> 00:02:02,33
which he said applauded New South while. As well as in England.

22
00:02:02,35 --> 00:02:09,75
Such was Bentham's prominence in the light of centuries that I expected to find numerous references to Magna Carta.

23
00:02:10,29 --> 00:02:16,83
In the early colonial records of New South whiles especially the early court cases.

24
00:02:16,84 --> 00:02:20,18
Diving clock mention the waiting twenty seven

25
00:02:20,18 --> 00:02:27,5
when I saw understood him it was the presiding magistrate who literally saying Magna Carta surprises not the litigant.

26
00:02:27,97 --> 00:02:32,17
But apart from this. I couldn't find any mention of Magna Carta.

27
00:02:32,49 --> 00:02:34,15
You know either the cushier reports

28
00:02:34,15 --> 00:02:42,6
or Dowling Select Case is which between them cover many of the court reports between seventeen and I in forty three.

29
00:02:43,81 --> 00:02:49,05
Given these striving in Senate swep saw it climbs that Magna Carta reason much quoted by strident

30
00:02:49,05 --> 00:02:51,54
when they're representing themselves in court cases.

31
00:02:52,46 --> 00:02:55,7
I wondered why their ancestors didn't appear to do a lot more lies.

32
00:02:55,75 --> 00:03:02,67
Perhaps I was smart a litigant seen person is more modern litigants that die the clock referred to a little bit earlier

33
00:03:03,37 --> 00:03:08,71
that fellow coins land too said you had to coin something.

34
00:03:08,72 --> 00:03:11,59
At one level it can be argued that Bentham was wrong

35
00:03:12,36 --> 00:03:17,7
and that there was nothing in our the transportation act of seventy ninety four the active part of the status in New

36
00:03:17,7 --> 00:03:23,07
South Wales which prevented a convict term expired from returning to England.

37
00:03:23,09 --> 00:03:26,36
Other than the extreme distance and great expense involved.

38
00:03:26,38 --> 00:03:32,62
But that does not necessarily explain in the absence of other references to the great shot at you know in New South

39
00:03:32,62 --> 00:03:37,84
whiles what might help to do is the fact that from as early as July seventh I.

40
00:03:38,51 --> 00:03:45,12
The common Lords applaud in the convict colony head in a kiddie respect. Let the haid of that applaud in England.

41
00:03:45,62 --> 00:03:51,21
So we've bought clothes on of Magna Carta as agreed to Boy King John in twelve fifteen.

42
00:03:51,38 --> 00:03:54,48
There was an acknowledgment of the primacy of the common law

43
00:03:55,34 --> 00:03:59,93
and this was recognised as one of the minor ongoing legacies of the settlement.

44
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:02,5
Between the king and his barons at Runnymede.

45
00:04:02,52 --> 00:04:09,13
Then in some wise from its earliest dies earliest colonial dies New South Wiles was ahead of England

46
00:04:09,13 --> 00:04:11,68
when a kind of fundamental rights.

47
00:04:11,7 --> 00:04:18,3
Had been this piece when an examination of rather early colonial records such as newspaper reports

48
00:04:18,3 --> 00:04:22,42
and dispatches between New South Wales officials and the British government.

49
00:04:22,43 --> 00:04:26,17
Reveals that there's nothing about Magna Carta or until twenty seven

50
00:04:26,17 --> 00:04:33,64
and then on the a few mentions that played a route by adding thirty one in my view the answer.

51
00:04:33,67 --> 00:04:39,49
Laws principally with Lord Sydney. Who was probably responsible for sending the First Fleet to botany by.

52
00:04:40,06 --> 00:04:48,34
And with the convict colonies first and fifth governess to Philip unlocked and McQuarrie large city in Lawton man.

53
00:04:50,25 --> 00:04:53,71
Over the last light hundred years the importance of Magna Carta as waxed

54
00:04:53,71 --> 00:05:00,34
and wind the summit continues to be the defining recognition of ancient liberties reaching back at least the time of it

55
00:05:00,34 --> 00:05:06,01
with the confessed up for others a great shot it was never more than a tenuous place treaty between King John

56
00:05:06,01 --> 00:05:08,67
and his rebellious barons.

57
00:05:08,68 --> 00:05:14,83
But even this more restricted view employed a direct challenge to King John's climb to rule by divine right.

58
00:05:15,35 --> 00:05:22,07
And it was the Stuart Kings climbs to rule by the will of God alone in the seventeenth century which guy Magna Carta

59
00:05:22,07 --> 00:05:23,27
renewed relevance.

60
00:05:23,74 --> 00:05:28,74
When Charles the Second asserted in the sixth nineties that God had put him on the throne

61
00:05:28,74 --> 00:05:30,55
and I only God could remove him.

62
00:05:30,62 --> 00:05:39,00
It was Lord Sydney's great right Uncle Algernon Sidney with an eye who counted in discourses concerning government the

63
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:45,97
quote the peril regionally in the people of England delegated into the power of men and we might therefore China.

64
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:56,00
Tycho why kings in discourses Sydney laws specifically on Magna contact to support his proposition that to depend on

65
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:04,59
the will of a man is sly free. Sidney said. This was without doubt to establish this among us by Magna Carta.

66
00:06:05,67 --> 00:06:12,25
Similarly to Granny's assertion that laws are not my boy kings because nice ones will be governed by a rule

67
00:06:12,25 --> 00:06:13,71
and not really.

68
00:06:13,78 --> 00:06:16,87
Sidney wrote The Great shot of that recapitulates

69
00:06:16,87 --> 00:06:24,03
and acknowledges there I shall inherit liberties a blog is the king to swear that he will not have the sill to lie in

70
00:06:24,03 --> 00:06:29,00
order not justice to any man according to the laws of the land.

71
00:06:29,02 --> 00:06:37,19
For writing discourses and their boy daring to challenge King Charles a second's climb to rule by divine rule at right.

72
00:06:37,21 --> 00:06:44,44
Sydney was tried for treason and found guilty and on the seventh of December sixth. He was beheaded.

73
00:06:44,45 --> 00:06:50,74
There are often a lot of heroes of those who believe that the will of more not should be subject to the will of

74
00:06:50,74 --> 00:06:53,57
parliament. Among them. Tommy Townsend.

75
00:06:54,13 --> 00:07:03,1
A drop of the blood of Algernon Sidney vines towns in proudly told the House of Commons ninety years after his future.

76
00:07:03,12 --> 00:07:04,68
Execution.

77
00:07:04,7 --> 00:07:12,47
After suffering setbacks during these early career as a government hack always one of those once upon a time on towns

78
00:07:12,48 --> 00:07:19,57
and began to support radical causes among them that of John Wilkes who had been repeatedly expelled from power meant

79
00:07:19,57 --> 00:07:24,69
for defining King George the third to be repeatedly reelected boys constituents.

80
00:07:26,24 --> 00:07:31,68
To perfect the plan of securing and guiding the liberties of the freest nice in the world against the future attacks

81
00:07:31,68 --> 00:07:38,57
and wicked ministers were clime built on the firm Bice's of Magna Carta. Backing Wilkes to the hilt.

82
00:07:38,7 --> 00:07:39,48
Tommy towns

83
00:07:39,48 --> 00:07:47,04
and addressed the commons the members of this house must not ask whether the man whom the electors have chosen he's fit

84
00:07:47,04 --> 00:07:56,1
company for them. Towns and say did he acquires an indisputable top to admission by that election and that election.

85
00:07:57,07 --> 00:08:02,69
Is the author of the American Declaration of Independence to. Thomas Jefferson Leiter acknowledged.

86
00:08:02,7 --> 00:08:05,74
Algernon Sydney a billion one of these inspirations.

87
00:08:06,07 --> 00:08:14,99
In discourses Sydney it is that nothing can be more evident than that of many man it will mirroring this in his

88
00:08:14,99 --> 00:08:22,89
declaration. Jefferson famously proclaimed We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.

89
00:08:22,96 --> 00:08:30,26
Alsono in Sydney is I very very bright political philosopher indeed not understood these dice because it was impossible

90
00:08:30,26 --> 00:08:35,63
to really which is to cite was a great think about a bad writer. If you want to be remembered.

91
00:08:35,64 --> 00:08:48,8
Well during the American Revolutionary War true to Algernon Sidney's principles bring among just a handful of members

92
00:08:48,8 --> 00:08:57,43
of the House of Commons who strongly backed the revolt an American colonists as George the third like to call them all

93
00:08:57,44 --> 00:09:00,64
wrong. McLean the new British government which emerged on to the war.

94
00:09:00,64 --> 00:09:06,51
Tommy Townsend because I'm home secretary responsible for negotiating a peace treaty with the Americans.

95
00:09:09,17 --> 00:09:15,36
To provide for American loyalists the king offered him a peerage. And that why Tommy towns in Sydney.

96
00:09:15,91 --> 00:09:24,03
Then off the United States refused to accept any more British convicts it fell to Lloyd Sydney to find an alternative.

97
00:09:24,05 --> 00:09:28,79
Refusing to adopt Jeremy Bentham to proposal to build a jaunt penitentiary

98
00:09:28,79 --> 00:09:36,41
or pan up the can because it allowed a single watchman to observe all the inmates with at the end might spring I will

99
00:09:36,41 --> 00:09:44,62
tell whether that watched. Sydney settled on a resumption of transportation this time to botany by.

100
00:09:44,64 --> 00:09:50,1
The stewards of the transportation act of seventy ninety four which Lord Sydney to help to sponsor the British

101
00:09:50,1 --> 00:09:58,4
Parliament convict I was see is quite could inflict such moderate punishment as might be inflicted on persons committed

102
00:09:58,4 --> 00:09:59,16
to a house of correction.

103
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,48
So the convicts had substantial rights under British law just as their rivals say he's had substantial responsibilities

104
00:10:07,35 --> 00:10:13,24
and this is now been generally accepted by a story and generous provision was might for the.

105
00:10:13,26 --> 00:10:18,01
Governor Philip kept and what contains sport it was left to acting.

106
00:10:18,03 --> 00:10:24,66
Tallie from judgment without the benefit of a council or other legal arrangements more in the spirit of Magna Carta.

107
00:10:25,27 --> 00:10:33,05
He had he had been a great Philip to the constant sort of the legal arrangements more in the spirit of Magna Carta had

108
00:10:33,05 --> 00:10:37,52
been agreed to by Sydney and Philip to the consternation of the First Lord of the Admiralty.

109
00:10:38,05 --> 00:10:42,8
Among these was in the instruction of the convicts would be subject to the ordinary criminal law

110
00:10:43,49 --> 00:10:47,98
and not to the hotshoe middle military law which applied to the Marines

111
00:10:47,98 --> 00:10:54,95
and pursuant to let US patent law at Sydney established a court of civil jurisdiction which could hear an action upon

112
00:10:54,95 --> 00:10:57,52
complaint to be my duty in writing to the court

113
00:10:57,52 --> 00:11:08,47
or any personal persons against any other personal persons residing within the said place of any cause he's a story

114
00:11:08,47 --> 00:11:14,47
that will strike what these millions implying that. As the first Floyd was ready.

115
00:11:16,62 --> 00:11:21,89
Handed I would do the master of the transport by they July. John Simpson.

116
00:11:21,91 --> 00:11:31,02
One of them six Susanna Holmes was accompanied by her infant son who the master of the transport refused to allow on

117
00:11:31,02 --> 00:11:31,45
board.

118
00:11:32,43 --> 00:11:33,48
A Pole that mother

119
00:11:33,48 --> 00:11:39,93
and child would be separated because the child of course hadn't been convicted of an offense in the didn't have any

120
00:11:39,93 --> 00:11:42,19
legal Bice's to.

121
00:11:42,21 --> 00:11:48,17
Simpson took the infant and rode up to London where he had to remonstrate with somebody and I'm office.

122
00:11:48,51 --> 00:11:58,53
Upon arrival Simpson bumped into the Home Office was very small just four rooms on the whole and only.

123
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,04
The Home Office including the secretary of state and the.

124
00:12:04,06 --> 00:12:08,06
I ran the British Empire the most the internal government right Britain.

125
00:12:08,26 --> 00:12:12,07
I got into when you on the wire hand there most of the night and people running when you.

126
00:12:12,1 --> 00:12:21,2
Something's not quite right size Simpson bumped into loads of it was quickly convinced the saw on the pipe was that

127
00:12:21,2 --> 00:12:25,91
would allow the infant to accompany its mother and almost as an afterthought he saw

128
00:12:25,91 --> 00:12:33,53
and pipe was allowing the by the father a convict by the name of Henry Cavill to go to the press got hold of his story

129
00:12:33,53 --> 00:12:40,31
and Keibler homes in the BY be quickly become celebrities sign much of the public dynamited to a trust fund to help

130
00:12:40,31 --> 00:12:41,8
them on a wider botany by.

131
00:12:42,26 --> 00:12:47,5
In their wisdom the trustees purchase clothes and books which were placed in a Haitian sack

132
00:12:47,5 --> 00:12:56,16
and loaded on to the transport Alexandra on another vessel. When Kibo went to collect the sack after robbing of Sydney.

133
00:12:56,78 --> 00:13:01,42
He was told by the Alexander's master Duncan Sinclair that the clothes that gone missing

134
00:13:01,42 --> 00:13:02,64
and I knew the books could be found.

135
00:13:03,84 --> 00:13:10,81
Meanwhile a court of civil jurisdiction a billion established and the Thai king advice for damages

136
00:13:11,93 --> 00:13:19,06
and following a three day hearing in early July seventy ninety I presided over by the judge advocate diving colons Kibo

137
00:13:19,06 --> 00:13:27,86
was awarded fifteen pounds in damages. So it was that in Cairo versus the first civil suit brought in a stride.

138
00:13:28,15 --> 00:13:33,00
A convict successfully sued the monster of a first fleet transport for lost luggage.

139
00:13:33,91 --> 00:13:41,91
You wouldn't do as well as that to die if you took on courts as a convict on the sentence Khyber would have been

140
00:13:41,91 --> 00:13:45,42
and I will bring these climb for damages in England.

141
00:13:45,43 --> 00:13:48,23
But in the convict colony different rules were applied

142
00:13:48,23 --> 00:13:52,15
and in this why the common law which laws at the heart of Magna Carta.

143
00:13:52,72 --> 00:13:59,27
Was more advanced in the big call and even it was in the ALL country. This on really critically important story.

144
00:14:00,36 --> 00:14:03,01
Even in the face of general stop I shouldn't.

145
00:14:03,24 --> 00:14:09,44
Govern I know so I should say that I do agree with John Hirst we've got to do something about the plot

146
00:14:09,44 --> 00:14:12,06
and in Canberra it's not wrong.

147
00:14:12,08 --> 00:14:17,78
Even in the face of general starvation Governor Philip exercised these enormous paths wisely

148
00:14:18,48 --> 00:14:24,73
and this combined with these personal examples such as accepting the Russian help the Colin need to survive just as

149
00:14:24,73 --> 00:14:31,64
important was the judicious use of the PAL would see the need given him to emancipate grant them land.

150
00:14:32,06 --> 00:14:38,6
When Phillip the part of the seven day ninety two he handed I have a chance break in child of the COME ON DA this I

151
00:14:38,6 --> 00:14:45,97
should in years of instability as light and I will govern a struggle to was by now politically entrenched coal

152
00:14:45,97 --> 00:14:49,86
and its fellow travellers according to Jeffrey Watson down.

153
00:14:49,93 --> 00:14:51,6
I see I see there's still a lot of

154
00:14:51,6 --> 00:14:57,64
and well some allies played the simmering tensions finally climaxed on the twenty sixth of January

155
00:14:59,08 --> 00:15:03,84
when the Johnson arrested governable on a ship government.

156
00:15:04,34 --> 00:15:10,9
At a time when Britain was fighting for its lot of guys the French This decide the least was a risky strategy.

157
00:15:10,92 --> 00:15:15,86
And so on. Surprisingly Johnson might no specific reference to Magna Carta The justify himself.

158
00:15:16,29 --> 00:15:20,64
Even so he's dispatched of all account Caso right had a familiar ring to it.

159
00:15:22,28 --> 00:15:26,59
Calvin a blog tried the high trust and confidence reposed in bars sovereign

160
00:15:26,59 --> 00:15:32,36
and acted up on a pro determined plan to subvert the laws of his country to terrify

161
00:15:32,36 --> 00:15:33,88
and influence the courts of justice

162
00:15:34,7 --> 00:15:39,22
and the person who had the misfortune to be of noxious to him with a fortune to liberty

163
00:15:39,22 --> 00:15:43,17
and the laws one act of oppression was succeeded.

164
00:15:43,19 --> 00:15:50,62
Until a general sensation of alarm and terror profile throughout the settlements said Johnson to council right.

165
00:15:51,1 --> 00:15:57,24
If King John had not so on the Magna Kadar in twelve fifteen the barons model of drawing up something similar.

166
00:15:58,68 --> 00:15:59,49
Notwithstanding the.

167
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:06,01
It's between the early governors in the colonies political factions many inhabitants had been doing well in no small

168
00:16:06,01 --> 00:16:10,97
part to the Polje to the policy Lord Sidney had sitting trying of emancipation and land grants

169
00:16:10,97 --> 00:16:12,41
and thanks to the in-laws

170
00:16:12,41 --> 00:16:19,75
and inside of the colonies fifth governor Laughlin McQuarrie recognized in a new policy which had on shore this is

171
00:16:19,75 --> 00:16:22,77
wrought had now president in England.

172
00:16:22,79 --> 00:16:27,31
So this is another example of the call of need to be calling looping ahead of them of a country

173
00:16:27,31 --> 00:16:34,11
when it comes to fundamental rights on the thirtieth of by providing tain McCoury right to vote. I can't counsel right.

174
00:16:35,75 --> 00:16:41,88
Upon myself to adopt a new law of conduct conceding that conceiving that emancipation

175
00:16:41,88 --> 00:16:49,05
when you nodded with rectitude good conduct should lead a man back to the rank of society which he full fitted

176
00:16:49,05 --> 00:16:52,95
and do a Y. In as far as the case will admit. All right.

177
00:16:52,97 --> 00:16:59,74
Respect for my bad conduct these appears to me to be the greatest inducement that could be held out towards the

178
00:16:59,74 --> 00:17:01,51
reformation of the manners of the inhabitants

179
00:17:02,42 --> 00:17:09,26
and I think it is consistent with the gracious fiber of this class of people then explained that he allowed for X.

180
00:17:09,26 --> 00:17:10,5
To dawn with him.

181
00:17:10,59 --> 00:17:17,61
The principal surgeon Darcy Wentworth He's assistant William read from the prosperous farmer in the land Andrew Thomson

182
00:17:17,61 --> 00:17:23,67
and the wealthy merchant Simeon low wall Wentworth and never in fact plain convicted of anything.

183
00:17:23,93 --> 00:17:28,62
It was widely believed that he was a next Harlem and not without reason. On one side.

184
00:17:29,89 --> 00:17:35,13
I have long conducted themselves with the greatest propriety McCoury said No I find them at all times ready to come

185
00:17:35,13 --> 00:17:39,77
forward the most liberal man it was the systems of government toward this small quarry

186
00:17:39,77 --> 00:17:42,96
and bars to be to point in Thompson as a magistrate in the whole.

187
00:17:43,49 --> 00:17:51,36
And he would soon appoint Wentworth as magistrate seen Sydney. Had Jeremy Bentham span up the can be built.

188
00:17:51,37 --> 00:17:57,73
It's difficult to imagine that would ever of delivered fully reform convicts on the skyll now contemplated by

189
00:17:57,73 --> 00:18:04,28
government quarry. Nor would. Going to lead to see it as magistrates in England. I'm sure I'm writing something.

190
00:18:04,84 --> 00:18:09,94
In this why the administration of lore in the colony had that of England

191
00:18:09,94 --> 00:18:16,35
but the prospect of being judged boy offended many of the cycle exclusive for a setlist.

192
00:18:16,51 --> 00:18:27,96
I'm not sure that if I go hold up before a magistrate in Paramount of all I would be very happy if I knew the name of.

193
00:18:29,65 --> 00:18:34,79
That I never catch their objections these are the exclusive for the settlers playing judge boy.

194
00:18:34,81 --> 00:18:42,12
They never cast their objections in terms of Magna Carta thirty nine of the twelfth edition.

195
00:18:42,29 --> 00:18:48,93
We would have allowed them to do you know for a man should be persuaded against says except by the lawful judgment of

196
00:18:48,93 --> 00:18:56,15
these pieces. Nevertheless the exclusives objected to London the batiks convict magistrates in there and why.

197
00:18:57,04 --> 00:19:01,49
And as a result Commissioner John Big was appointed to inquire into the McCoury administration.

198
00:19:02,05 --> 00:19:04,96
But the governor didn't help him. So when he to forward the commission.

199
00:19:05,28 --> 00:19:09,53
And appointed another ex-con big William Redfern to the bench.

200
00:19:09,55 --> 00:19:16,69
It was Das he went with son William Charles Wentworth who made the first comprehensive piece for constitutional reform

201
00:19:16,69 --> 00:19:21,19
of the convict colony. You know statistical a story political.

202
00:19:21,74 --> 00:19:26,32
Description of the colony of New South whiles a book written and published in England

203
00:19:26,32 --> 00:19:33,37
and I went with proposed the introduction of trial by jury a free press and elected legislature

204
00:19:33,37 --> 00:19:39,59
and an independent supreme court but nowhere in this book of almost five hundred pages.

205
00:19:39,81 --> 00:19:47,58
Is there a reference to Magna Carta rather resign putting more general terms it's a fundamental maxim of the British

206
00:19:47,58 --> 00:19:54,47
constitution went with right that Texas should be levied on the subject without his consent expressed boys

207
00:19:54,47 --> 00:20:03,12
Representatives even to this maxim the rod is in directly FROM clause twelve of the. Right. Shot of that's the one of.

208
00:20:03,14 --> 00:20:09,68
Which But gains that society. What was in a military tax nice a good age. All right.

209
00:20:09,75 --> 00:20:13,46
Shall be imposed on at Kingdom unless part Common Council of that kingdom.

210
00:20:13,86 --> 00:20:24,02
Which is no taxation without representation and argument according to some following on from Commission a big.

211
00:20:24,04 --> 00:20:31,08
Reports twenty two an independent Supreme Court was established limited Troll Boy jury was implemented

212
00:20:31,08 --> 00:20:35,01
and appointed Legislative Council was established to.

213
00:20:35,02 --> 00:20:40,77
Success a Thomas Brisbane also introduced what he called the experiment of the four letter to the freedom of the press

214
00:20:41,68 --> 00:20:47,09
and dissipating these concessions in the second edition of his book went with the written in the mind.

215
00:20:47,9 --> 00:20:53,99
It's probable that all these privileges which the author has contended for will be considered accepting perhaps full

216
00:20:53,99 --> 00:21:00,27
trial by jury and the establishment of a house of assembly and if those privileges of withheld little longer.

217
00:21:00,46 --> 00:21:05,07
It will anybody from the conviction of the colony hasn't yet arrived sufficient degree

218
00:21:05,07 --> 00:21:10,9
but you're ready for the reception an exercise of them.

219
00:21:10,92 --> 00:21:16,58
The granting of these further constitutional considerations was ultimately an issue for the British government

220
00:21:16,58 --> 00:21:24,02
and pollen and having been taught a lesson by the revolt of the American colonists less than half a century earlier.

221
00:21:24,33 --> 00:21:31,56
It was a matter of when not if jury and elected legislature would be introduced.

222
00:21:32,45 --> 00:21:36,22
However while a man supposed legal for these Chinese assoon as possible.

223
00:21:36,28 --> 00:21:43,91
Some exclusives for the vigorous real God the lying action now divided especially by the prospect of being judged by

224
00:21:43,91 --> 00:21:51,7
juries of X. Convex and other complication was Gov Brisbane successor Ralph dolling a prickly military not net.

225
00:21:52,16 --> 00:21:57,78
Broader than any criticism of his administration of the colonies now often pointed newspaper editorials.

226
00:21:57,86 --> 00:21:59,8
Indeed it was the convict.

227
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:01,38
Conflict between dolling

228
00:22:01,38 --> 00:22:08,07
and I was pushing for reform which triggered the only direct official reference socket fawned on Magna Carta up to

229
00:22:08,07 --> 00:22:14,32
white in forty four. To petition the king in both houses of parliament full trial by jury and elected legislature.

230
00:22:14,79 --> 00:22:21,77
A public meeting was held at Sydney's courthouse on the twenty sixth January twenty seven there were a large crowd was

231
00:22:21,77 --> 00:22:23,65
addressed by William Charles Wentworth.

232
00:22:23,91 --> 00:22:31,48
Lee's Constitutional Rights belong as much to the people as the crown belong to the king he said I was a birthright of

233
00:22:31,48 --> 00:22:35,91
the people and nothing but the strongest necessity could justify withholding them an instant.

234
00:22:36,72 --> 00:22:43,6
So the petition itself set out to show why there was not just this no such necessity withhold them any further.

235
00:22:44,61 --> 00:22:50,71
In relation to jury trials the petitions were careful to point out that the competency for trial by jury has been

236
00:22:50,71 --> 00:22:57,69
proved boy upwards of two years' experience in that mode of trial in the colonies courts of Quarter Sessions.

237
00:22:57,92 --> 00:23:05,54
Therefore the inference was that to extend that to all jury trials carried very little risk it would be an impact

238
00:23:05,54 --> 00:23:06,53
incremental chime.

239
00:23:07,06 --> 00:23:13,38
It was in relation to the call for an elected legislature of the petition involved to grant China referring to the

240
00:23:13,38 --> 00:23:20,96
colonies annual revenue of sixty thousand pounds the petition is quite decent Norma's some isn't here the two billion

241
00:23:20,96 --> 00:23:24,22
levied on your Majesty's humble petition is both already of power.

242
00:23:24,47 --> 00:23:30,99
And other was without their consent contra to Magna Carta. And that ended the dispatches back to.

243
00:23:32,4 --> 00:23:35,76
England as a nexus to the governor as official dispatches to the.

244
00:23:36,24 --> 00:23:40,53
Well by then colonial secretary and that's how it was in the official record.

245
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,75
While the editor of Sydney's monitor news Piper described as contrary to an expressed quote was in Magna Carta.

246
00:23:48,73 --> 00:23:54,63
My view is that it is that based on a reference to close twelve which I mentioned earlier.

247
00:23:54,65 --> 00:23:59,95
Whatever the case the petition then addressed itself to the practical matter of whether they are enough people in.

248
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:01,94
The call only qualified to stand for election.

249
00:24:02,31 --> 00:24:06,94
Their idea of the magistrate magistracies the petition

250
00:24:07,7 --> 00:24:10,86
and three times as many gentlemen who will be fitted by their will

251
00:24:10,86 --> 00:24:17,66
and talents to act as members of a ledge to the assembly. Such occupants left Governor dolling unimpressed.

252
00:24:17,95 --> 00:24:23,29
And he's covering dispatch which accompanied the petition of the Colonial Secretary Lord Bathurst presentation to the

253
00:24:23,29 --> 00:24:26,6
king darling said it started of in infancy.

254
00:24:26,79 --> 00:24:33,35
At present reigned in New South Wales unfit for those institutions which in England as a result of its advancement

255
00:24:33,35 --> 00:24:33,9
and maturity.

256
00:24:34,48 --> 00:24:40,56
Now then anticipating this went with a swing to what the copies of the petition would be taken to London by Gregory

257
00:24:40,56 --> 00:24:47,18
Blaxland and they are presented to sympathise as seen by Palma. As the editor of the city morning.

258
00:24:47,22 --> 00:24:52,55
I'm honored to put it. Lord Bathurst is not as cold he will towards a house of the same.

259
00:24:52,57 --> 00:24:59,31
We're glad therefore that power in the discipline petitioned as well as the King Live.

260
00:24:59,34 --> 00:25:02,57
This campaign for constitutional reform had some years left to run.

261
00:25:03,96 --> 00:25:07,04
I could only find references to Magna Carta up to white

262
00:25:07,04 --> 00:25:15,07
and forty three by which time trial by jury in a posh elected legislature in the New South whiles the first reference

263
00:25:15,07 --> 00:25:22,46
was in a letter to the Sydney is it published in the thirteenth of August twenty nine the quoting the Latin version of

264
00:25:22,46 --> 00:25:27,59
Magna Carta schools thirty nine. Twelve edition.

265
00:25:27,75 --> 00:25:35,46
There are derived at the free born children of a man's man supposed to have the benefits of unlimited trial by jury.

266
00:25:35,48 --> 00:25:41,89
And the second reference appeared in an article in the stride in the thirtieth of July thirty climbing that upon the

267
00:25:41,89 --> 00:25:48,25
principle of Magna Carter a verdict of twelve is to be a verdict of law the piper criticized

268
00:25:48,25 --> 00:25:54,94
and identified court judgment on the vices that a positive jury verdict for the defendant had been replaced by a

269
00:25:54,94 --> 00:26:02,69
special verdict of the judge. This was in fact a reference to the. Of pine number two.

270
00:26:03,49 --> 00:26:05,24
According to the official court report.

271
00:26:05,65 --> 00:26:08,81
The attorney general had allowed the case to go to the jury

272
00:26:08,81 --> 00:26:14,39
and I found a verdict for the defendant against the direction of the judges who ruled that upon the playthings the

273
00:26:14,39 --> 00:26:19,79
crown was in top of the judgment the defendants barristers Wardell and Wentworth that's W.

274
00:26:19,79 --> 00:26:26,32
So he went with admitted on appeal that in strictness of law the defendant is not my dad any total against the Crown

275
00:26:26,32 --> 00:26:32,87
but instead that iniquity the verdict stood as the colonies to the finest barristers Richard

276
00:26:32,87 --> 00:26:37,25
and William Charles Wentworth must have now in Iraq human would not succeed.

277
00:26:37,89 --> 00:26:42,01
So perhaps it's no coincidence that the appeal to Magna Carta.

278
00:26:42,02 --> 00:26:50,6
Appeared without attribution in a news pipe which Wardell and went with had founded back in twenty four.

279
00:26:50,62 --> 00:26:56,39
All are specific to references to Magna Carta during the convict first dies a few

280
00:26:56,39 --> 00:27:03,37
and far between the nine of the last man to be executed for invoking it has been celebrated.

281
00:27:03,93 --> 00:27:07,2
Since the twenty second of January seventeenth ID night

282
00:27:07,2 --> 00:27:15,35
when Governor Philip Sidney after the home secretary Lord Sidney half so well thought of you

283
00:27:15,35 --> 00:27:21,89
when he'd been offered a peerage for his role in securing a peace treaty with the revolt of American colonists the home

284
00:27:21,89 --> 00:27:31,66
secretary then still now as Tommy Townsend charged the nine Sidney. For the top will. Algernon Sidney.

285
00:27:32,28 --> 00:27:35,12
Algernon Sidney with and on.

286
00:27:35,89 --> 00:27:41,07
So why is there a difference in the spelling between Sydney's we now with the law and Sydney with the on.

287
00:27:41,59 --> 00:27:46,53
In fact first proposed with a no i did George the third.

288
00:27:46,54 --> 00:27:51,46
But then he discovered what he called the elder branches of the family might have a climb on it.

289
00:27:51,46 --> 00:27:59,49
So a right to the king as fall lies the consideration of the toilets occupies my thoughts no farther than to avoid

290
00:27:59,49 --> 00:28:04,19
taking. Anyone which might clash with the pretensions of any other family.

291
00:28:04,76 --> 00:28:11,48
If your Majesty will allow me to Chinese the toilets of Sydney with a wife sitting with a wall of chisel Hirst neither

292
00:28:11,48 --> 00:28:16,52
of which a climb boy anybody and to which on the law. I'd bar the Sydney's in the V.

293
00:28:16,52 --> 00:28:22,3
Is more relatives will be satisfied in that all offend. Nobody else.

294
00:28:22,32 --> 00:28:29,53
In this roundabout why then the I'm a very bright city celebrates Algernon Sidney the last man to be martyred for

295
00:28:29,53 --> 00:28:40,06
invoking Magna Carta against an absolute as British King thank you thank you.
