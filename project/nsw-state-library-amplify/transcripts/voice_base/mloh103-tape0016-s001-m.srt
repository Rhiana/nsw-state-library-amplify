1
00:00:13,52 --> 00:00:39,67
Yes i thought it was one of those of us who was one of us. Well. I'm robin miller and. I'm a member of robb read.

2
00:00:39,67 --> 00:00:52,97
Community. Which is one of the older ones. Established in this area we were as established in nineteen eighty.

3
00:00:52,97 --> 00:01:00,23
As a community. Before that. I had lived on the property. For a couple of years.

4
00:01:00,23 --> 00:01:11,6
And it soon became clear that there was an absurdly large amount of land a single. Widow with at the time no.

5
00:01:11,6 --> 00:01:21,05
No family living with me. And so since i kept meeting. Young people in the area.

6
00:01:21,05 --> 00:01:28,47
Who had obviously had skills and great need for a home base.

7
00:01:30,97 --> 00:01:38,04
I kept thinking we'll this is would be a good idea to to see if we could become a community.

8
00:01:38,04 --> 00:01:50,18
And the whole story of how this has happened this is unfolded over the last twelve years. A couple first. I met.

9
00:01:53,1 --> 00:02:02,51
I had been admiring. These mags and jugs that were in the local craft shop. And had bought several of them.

10
00:02:02,51 --> 00:02:14,8
Because i just liked the the way they were thrown in the design of them. And i was at a. A function in nimbin weird.

11
00:02:14,8 --> 00:02:23,93
Money was being raised to the person beyond i think it's and. Someone introduced. Jeff sterling to me.

12
00:02:23,93 --> 00:02:32,33
And i realized this is the name of the thought it was talking with and found that he and his wife

13
00:02:32,33 --> 00:02:38,26
and family were just about to leave the area.

14
00:02:38,26 --> 00:02:45,27
Having been here for a couple of years and not found any satisfactory place to live and.

15
00:02:45,27 --> 00:02:58,39
It had been for them it hadn't been a great success. So i said hey you know. We've got some land. Here at lilian rock.

16
00:02:58,39 --> 00:03:03,07
Why didn't you come out and have a look. You know we've been looking for people.

17
00:03:03,07 --> 00:03:09,96
Basically people like you with with skills and who want to live in the area.

18
00:03:12,62 --> 00:03:20,65
So they thanked me very politely and said well maybe. Yes. If we've got time before we leave we'll try and get out.

19
00:03:20,65 --> 00:03:23,33
This it to you and.

20
00:03:23,33 --> 00:03:30,57
The next day was sunday i think we were having a workday then the whole i think i was up on the roof

21
00:03:30,57 --> 00:03:39,72
or painting the roof or something and. Suddenly there was a den up but different. Saying hey we couldn't.

22
00:03:39,72 --> 00:03:47,96
We couldn't sleep all night thinking about this. Could we could we come and see the place. And so that was good.

23
00:03:47,96 --> 00:03:56,57
So we would go to the mountains. They came and they looked around and. We had lunch she was and i said.

24
00:03:56,57 --> 00:04:01,84
Yes we'd like to like to take you up on those so that was really the beginning.

25
00:04:02,6 --> 00:04:12,53
I mean it really was a pick up wasn't it. The dance. And the well i came. A couple of.

26
00:04:12,92 --> 00:04:22,33
They moved over a couple of months later and. They've been here ever since and. They've gone through many yeah.

27
00:04:24,84 --> 00:04:37,78
Transfiguration gifts being a part of. Polly being a craftsman. And then. Weaver. This designer.

28
00:04:37,78 --> 00:04:46,52
And now they are the wild turkey filth makers who are exporting their produce products.

29
00:04:46,52 --> 00:04:57,06
Produce so sort of up and down the coast. And running which shops in film making and. And from.

30
00:04:57,06 --> 00:05:09,79
From then on it was a gradual. Gifts brother came. And he settled it and he's a cabinet maker and wanted to and.

31
00:05:09,79 --> 00:05:22,36
So it grew very slowly and gradually. And people lived in tents while lay built themselves. Cabins or shelters.

32
00:05:22,36 --> 00:05:46,36
Do you want me to talk about the. The process of becoming legal process. They is well. The thing that i felt.

33
00:05:46,36 --> 00:05:59,15
Seemed to be important. Was that if people. Needed a place to build a home and needed.

34
00:05:59,15 --> 00:06:09,34
The sort of support that the community. Can give you those were the. Very important criteria.

35
00:06:10,42 --> 00:06:23,82
It wasn't so important that they have. With money. They contribute money to buy she is.

36
00:06:23,82 --> 00:06:31,87
I didn't want money to be the limiting factor. Because after all the place is paid for anyway.

37
00:06:32,63 --> 00:06:39,53
And i wasn't under any particular burden of. It said that it was a matter of.

38
00:06:39,53 --> 00:06:49,57
Was more important to for a sort of sympathetic people. To get together to share the land.

39
00:06:50,00 --> 00:07:00,6
And i think on the whole it worked out that way. And with danny ever had people come by invitation.

40
00:07:00,6 --> 00:07:10,69
There's been a few who've. Sort of. Wrecked up and said hey you know i've got i've just got so much money.

41
00:07:10,69 --> 00:07:18,87
I want to buy a share here and. We have to say. I'm sorry that's not the way. We do things here. In fact.

42
00:07:18,87 --> 00:07:30,41
Sometimes it's. It takes it takes one hundred percent approval before any new one can come to live here.

43
00:07:30,41 --> 00:07:52,6
As a man that is. I think that was. Yes. Another idea that. I head. At the beginning.

44
00:07:52,6 --> 00:08:06,31
And one reason i was particularly bled. Have poly and if. Sterling. Was that they were just creative people and.

45
00:08:06,31 --> 00:08:15,64
I had known from my own parents. Experience that it's very. Often for people who are creative.

46
00:08:15,64 --> 00:08:28,24
In this way to acquire much capital. Basis. So i felt that it would be good if there were more emphasis.

47
00:08:28,24 --> 00:08:41,59
More people who had these. Sort of skills and needed a place to leave. I felt that would be a very important aspect.

48
00:08:41,59 --> 00:08:54,49
To inviting those individuals. To come and live here. Mind you it isn't always enough. And not everybody. Is that way.

49
00:08:54,49 --> 00:09:02,39
But there are a lot. There's a number of musicians. And a number of crafts people.

50
00:09:02,39 --> 00:09:13,07
I think probably in every household there's one or other. But that. They're designed to be a fortunate so the vs.

51
00:09:13,07 --> 00:09:30,72
One thing leading to another. Us has when it. I think the stain from knowing that my parents. Heads.

52
00:09:30,72 --> 00:09:32,18
Today great you should go d. In.

53
00:09:33,54 --> 00:09:43,11
In paying rent even and they had to pay rent full most of them a large if they didn't have enough. To to put together.

54
00:09:43,79 --> 00:09:53,82
You know what was necessary to own their own home. It's my father's or it.

55
00:09:53,82 --> 00:09:59,1
Or my father is an artist and my mother was a writer and. Between them.

56
00:09:59,1 --> 00:10:04,02
I knew that they had quite a hard financial struggle. And in fact.

57
00:10:04,02 --> 00:10:12,53
We never they never earned their own home until i was sort of. In my thirty's probably.

58
00:10:12,78 --> 00:10:19,95
That so that they were constantly having to pay rent for a place to live and.

59
00:10:19,95 --> 00:10:32,13
I just felt that the people who had least. Creative skills and wanted to do that if. Energies to.

60
00:10:32,13 --> 00:10:46,5
Exploring those skills. It would be rather good. To allow them to to live here without too much financial burden. Fall.

61
00:10:46,5 --> 00:11:09,16
I mean there's no effective rein to the cost. Never to be the important thing. But pay back the main. Sort of workers.

62
00:11:09,16 --> 00:11:21,22
Trying to make good. Yes well. I think my parents. I mean they just managed somehow or other. But.

63
00:11:21,22 --> 00:11:31,19
I just felt that i didn't want people. I just thought it would be that. A better way.

64
00:11:31,19 --> 00:11:37,89
If they didn't have to spend most of their income. Paying for rent.

65
00:11:37,89 --> 00:11:43,24
And they could use it in building a house or you know.

66
00:11:43,24 --> 00:12:12,53
Helping with the children's unseen you know a williams yes yes yes yes yes yes. Was it. So yes yes yes..

67
00:12:05,00 --> 00:12:15,7
In a in only in this whole area. Since nine hundred seventy s. Nineteen seventy three which was the.

68
00:12:15,7 --> 00:12:23,5
Aquarius hit it first aquarius first time they had been a number of people.

69
00:12:23,5 --> 00:12:35,53
Becoming interested in building their own homes goes and. The home builders association had become pretty active.

70
00:12:35,53 --> 00:12:47,97
And one of the problems about this was that. There was not much. Consultation there was no.

71
00:12:47,97 --> 00:12:56,72
Nothing in the way of a manual on how to build your own home or. There was very little literature around that level.

72
00:12:56,72 --> 00:13:05,41
To help people like that. And there were. There was one architect. And a number of people who had some skills.

73
00:13:05,41 --> 00:13:16,05
And they were very active. That was a.d. Of course. They were very active in this home builders association.

74
00:13:16,05 --> 00:13:28,97
And the home builders association. In conjunction with. I guess. Liz mall council. Got together. This seminar in in.

75
00:13:28,97 --> 00:13:35,74
No. I think it was about november nine hundred seventy nine and. I know it was just be full the eighty's.

76
00:13:38,79 --> 00:13:49,00
And it at that seminar pull land it was then the minister for the environment dozens. Came and.

77
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:51,91
After a lot of discussion. And lot of arguments.

78
00:13:51,91 --> 00:13:55,82
And a lot of opposition from a small council and

79
00:13:55,82 --> 00:14:07,53
and other people to lend his we're feeling very threatened by this idea of multiple look and sees poll land.

80
00:14:07,53 --> 00:14:17,76
Came out with this. Some ation. All right we will. Establish a pilot scheme of. Twenty two i think it was.

81
00:14:17,76 --> 00:14:26,00
Well to block it in cities which will be permitted. In the list moshe. Will the stablish a consulting.

82
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:38,88
To the architects builders will bring out. I think they brought out a low cost country. Housing. Booklet and.

83
00:14:38,88 --> 00:14:48,49
There was generally a sort of an overriding the. The fears and the opposition.

84
00:14:48,49 --> 00:14:55,6
Being put up against multiple occupancies. And of course.

85
00:14:55,6 --> 00:15:08,86
For those of us who had been interested in gain a bad step this form of land use. It was a time of euphoria.

86
00:15:08,86 --> 00:15:17,72
At least that moment of euphoria. And as a result of that. Although we ourselves are not in let's moshe.

87
00:15:17,72 --> 00:15:32,44
But in cuyahoga i felt that it was only a matter of time before the others would be willing to accept the idea of

88
00:15:32,44 --> 00:15:42,59
multiple occupancy. And so i felt all right about trying to go ahead with. Inviting people to come and share.

89
00:15:42,59 --> 00:15:46,47
The land here. This wasn't.

90
00:15:46,47 --> 00:15:54,18
I wasn't unique in there was there were two or three other people in the area who were also.

91
00:15:54,18 --> 00:16:03,32
Who earned less and then you were also doing it it's i think i've been lucky that the people who has sort of.

92
00:16:03,32 --> 00:16:14,16
Well i mean to discuss. Area has somehow or other sort of settled and. We've been able to be a. Yes.

93
00:16:14,16 --> 00:16:22,46
To consolidate the community as well as we have. There was a period of course from from.

94
00:16:22,46 --> 00:16:31,49
Nine hundred eighty when the first. New the first people who invited here.

95
00:16:31,49 --> 00:16:36,88
Came to live here in the early one nine hundred eighty.

96
00:16:36,88 --> 00:16:45,24
Until about nine hundred eighty six i think it was nine hundred eighty seven. That we got.

97
00:16:45,24 --> 00:16:56,1
Official recognition of our right to have a multiple occupancy. On this land. But that was during the time when.

98
00:16:56,1 --> 00:17:06,93
Council. Was going through quite a lot of. Heart searching you could call it. About the wisdom of.

99
00:17:06,93 --> 00:17:14,52
Having multiple occupancies. Mind you they were having them. Anyway. Because there was a lot of people just.

100
00:17:14,52 --> 00:17:23,04
Just settling and living in building and. I felt quite. Sorry for the late. Council inspectors when late started.

101
00:17:23,04 --> 00:17:32,57
Sort of. Telling is this sad story. You know that i. I had no physical wary of. Of even.

102
00:17:32,57 --> 00:17:42,91
Visiting all these blazes let alone inspecting them properly and assessing their long term worse.

103
00:17:42,91 --> 00:17:56,08
But i think eventually accepted that the propositions that they would have to allow multiple up to the east so they

104
00:17:56,08 --> 00:18:02,01
have done it in those. In this corner. Of their. Shara.

105
00:18:02,01 --> 00:18:10,29
Which used to be part of the old or a new show and they excluded. Multiple occupancies from the rest of the show.

106
00:18:10,29 --> 00:18:19,83
At least at the beginning. In fact that. I think has pro rechanged now is they've. We haven't got.

107
00:18:19,83 --> 00:18:31,73
You know horns and green tails and that we really are human beings too and. Maybe it's just as. Adequate and uses.

108
00:18:31,73 --> 00:19:03,00
As any other form of occupancy. So that's just. I think very personal in that my daughter. When i came to nimbin.

109
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:11,23
Because i guess i must. I can't claim any particular. Marriage out of this.

110
00:19:11,23 --> 00:19:21,73
My daughter had been interested in the place and had been living here for a couple of years.

111
00:19:21,73 --> 00:19:37,6
Not a son had been here for the. Aquaria says to us a little now five. To hitchhike. Up here from school.

112
00:19:37,6 --> 00:19:47,47
With a couple of his friends. But there was no way i was going to allow my fifteen year old daughter to. Come up here.

113
00:19:47,47 --> 00:20:01,81
On her own hitchhiking. So i bundled her. A number of her friends and into the car and we drove up here. And.

114
00:20:01,81 --> 00:20:12,53
So sort of inadvertently. I was it. The name didn't mean that in seventy three although i must confess that it was not.

115
00:20:12,73 --> 00:20:22,09
My initial choose. Well there now i'm very glad that i was experienced at least a little bit of it.

116
00:20:22,09 --> 00:20:35,74
I didn't come back again and. Couple of years later when i visited my daughter who also said.

117
00:20:35,74 --> 00:20:43,77
I came back to visit my daughter. A couple of times. In the succeeding use and.

118
00:20:43,77 --> 00:20:49,58
It was a very stimulating you know very exciting. Place.

119
00:20:49,58 --> 00:20:59,39
Naturally i was appalled by some of the sort of conditions the people were living in like like my daughter had her

120
00:20:59,39 --> 00:21:05,91
first home. Consisted of a piece of plastic. Pinned up.

121
00:21:05,91 --> 00:21:15,21
Tied up underneath the len tan a bush that she had come out of that she was perfectly happy there.

122
00:21:16,91 --> 00:21:21,33
I'm glad to say she's moved on to slightly grander things.

123
00:21:21,66 --> 00:21:32,97
But at the time at the stage she was it was and she was making very good friends she was happy she was healthy and i

124
00:21:32,97 --> 00:21:49,22
and. I really began to appreciate something of what this whole area and philosophy. Was doing. Was about.

125
00:21:49,22 --> 00:22:01,29
And i must state that it was. The young people who sort of taught me. But for them i would have gone on as a sort of.

126
00:22:01,29 --> 00:22:17,99
The standard middle class mum in the suburbs of sydney. It's us.

127
00:22:17,99 --> 00:22:37,08
What's i think there's a lot of the of us trying to be as states.

128
00:22:38,45 --> 00:22:46,81
I think initially when we first came to live here that brown bread. There was a general feeling.

129
00:22:47,5 --> 00:22:58,78
At the end of the seventy's. That we should be trying to live. A lot more simply than we had been living.

130
00:22:58,78 --> 00:23:10,05
And also that we should be exploring different uses of the land. Different uses of agriculture.

131
00:23:10,05 --> 00:23:17,44
Different types of their group culture. Much more towards the line of perma culture and.

132
00:23:17,44 --> 00:23:28,96
Sustainable sort of production rather than. The agricultural monoculture that is the more general.

133
00:23:33,96 --> 00:23:36,25
Let's see other philosophies.

134
00:23:36,25 --> 00:23:50,13
Had when you look at the loss of these sort of grow out of experience then there was a bit of fear i think.

135
00:23:50,13 --> 00:24:05,61
And i know amongst some people. That there would be a world. Collapse of. World supply.

136
00:24:05,61 --> 00:24:16,85
Things like that role in the oil and. The fear that the. That was still a fear of. Nuclear holocaust. Said that.

137
00:24:16,85 --> 00:24:32,8
To live in a place that was at least slightly remote. Likely moral removed from the centers of so-called civilization.

138
00:24:34,05 --> 00:24:38,43
Seemed to be of. Of a positive benefit.

139
00:24:38,43 --> 00:24:45,45
Mind you i don't think we succeeded they will i mean it seems to got closer and closer to hear everything.

140
00:24:45,45 --> 00:24:52,79
In the intervening time and i'm in the feeling how. How remote it all was it has.

141
00:24:52,79 --> 00:25:08,27
And now it just seems as if it's just. Just like a suburb of. The whole east case. The think that the. It was.

142
00:25:08,27 --> 00:25:18,54
It was very much a social experiment. If one can use that word and experiment without having any.

143
00:25:18,54 --> 00:25:33,57
Control system to judge it by that a social experiment in seeing how will one could lose.

144
00:25:33,57 --> 00:25:53,72
In respect to quality of life. On very very little money. Very little income. And that sort of feeling when i look.

145
00:25:53,72 --> 00:26:04,63
When i visit my friends in the city. With their. Well most of the now have got rid of their mortgages. That any just.

146
00:26:04,63 --> 00:26:12,53
And they've got their three hours and you know. Their problems about where they go this year for their holiday.

147
00:26:13,01 --> 00:26:31,85
And such concerns. I feel she who we really have got such a lovely peaceful. And varied quality of life. Here.

148
00:26:31,85 --> 00:26:42,05
And we have a lead to go through those years those strace. Us. There's a lot of people heads.

149
00:26:42,05 --> 00:26:48,5
And i think there is something coming out of the. Us. Of course the main.

150
00:26:49,32 --> 00:26:55,86
I've always said the line product of this community. If you. If you want to talk about product.

151
00:26:55,86 --> 00:27:05,69
As a as a measure of success the product of this community is its children. And the.

152
00:27:05,69 --> 00:27:20,44
The children who are growing up here and have grown up. Over the last four years. Just seemed to be such.

153
00:27:20,44 --> 00:27:34,44
Well balanced lovely lovely. Unstressed. Young people. I guess it's early cards to say it. How they'll end up.

154
00:27:34,44 --> 00:27:48,25
Later on but. But it's a it's a big group of children. Like they're eighteen. I think and.

155
00:27:48,25 --> 00:27:58,29
With the eldest being eighteen years old the youngest being one that they have.

156
00:27:58,29 --> 00:28:06,01
They have more of a community than their adult. Their parents are really in that. They they sort of.

157
00:28:06,01 --> 00:28:15,68
Care for each other they look after each other and. There's a lot of course a little groups. Of age range rule. Six.

158
00:28:15,68 --> 00:28:24,04
That. Get together like. There's a cluster of. Little girls about five little girls all about the same age.

159
00:28:24,04 --> 00:28:30,79
And they form the most wonderful little. Subgroup amongst them. But on the whole. I think.

160
00:28:30,79 --> 00:28:38,16
You know if you want to judge a society by. Anything. This.

161
00:28:38,16 --> 00:28:39,07
The behavior

162
00:28:39,07 --> 00:29:07,37
and health of their children is is one way that it could be ten zero zero zero zero zero zero zero she she has.

163
00:29:07,37 --> 00:29:20,69
My own daughter. Yes. She has. Well she's moved in her desire for home life. As a sort of the normal.

164
00:29:20,69 --> 00:29:31,26
Suburban middle class suburban domestic. Set up with her own room and. You know.

165
00:29:31,26 --> 00:29:40,38
Washing machines and everything that was appropriate in in the suburban households. To this us. Shelter and. With us.

166
00:29:40,38 --> 00:29:52,04
Sleeping bags. And later plastic. Us. Skin loose sheets and. Was tied into a land down a bush.

167
00:29:52,04 --> 00:30:01,18
And us and then through six issues. Homes that she and her partner has. That have built from.

168
00:30:01,18 --> 00:30:18,00
You know simple polls to splendid. Stone and mansions almost. And then she. Right. I want to do something in my life.

169
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:27,82
I don't want to spend my time. Just washing and. Doing the garden. So he went back as a mature student.

170
00:30:27,82 --> 00:30:45,00
And did nursing. And is now working in sydney is a community in this very happy. If she saw the right sort of work.

171
00:30:45,00 --> 00:31:13,23
Opportunity i think the structure of the legal structure. Well from. Nine hundred eighty on. We gradually came across.

172
00:31:13,23 --> 00:31:30,61
People in the area who were searching for a place to live and. Those of us who were then living on the.

173
00:31:30,61 --> 00:31:38,44
Moralist decided whether or not we would invite them to come and share the land.
