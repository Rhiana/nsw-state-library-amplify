1
00:00:15,34 --> 00:00:21,46
In nineteen eighty. After the first couple had come to share the land.

2
00:00:23,2 --> 00:00:31,99
We met some others who also were looking for a place to live and build a place. They have.

3
00:00:31,99 --> 00:00:39,46
And we decided between ourselves. Ok. They're the right sort.

4
00:00:39,46 --> 00:00:49,5
They're the sort of people would like to share the land with. Let's invite them. So we did. So they became the next.

5
00:00:49,5 --> 00:01:00,84
The next layer of. That you feel and then there is people's. Members of family brothers.

6
00:01:00,84 --> 00:01:13,96
And eventually the parents came. Said that it's a sort of set of extended families. In a way.

7
00:01:13,96 --> 00:01:25,88
But basically it has to be. People being invited by the present. Members. To come and live here.

8
00:01:25,88 --> 00:01:36,39
And not just a matter of a money. Transaction like buying a few. On the property. Legally.

9
00:01:37,62 --> 00:01:48,25
We had to live beyond a little. As it were for about eight years. Which i must confess gave me.

10
00:01:48,25 --> 00:01:57,21
Times when i was very concerned and worried. Not only the possibility.

11
00:01:57,21 --> 00:02:07,54
The risk that was there always that something could turn nasty in the council. Come and try and. Boulders.

12
00:02:07,54 --> 00:02:19,06
Some of the houses that had been built. But also the feeling that. I was take nick least still. The chief.

13
00:02:19,06 --> 00:02:30,78
Shareholder in the company which owned the land. And all these people who had come on our invitation.

14
00:02:30,78 --> 00:02:35,23
Virtually were unprotected by the law. And the s. It.

15
00:02:35,23 --> 00:02:45,82
That they had put in the houses they had built and the trees that planted were technically not.

16
00:02:45,82 --> 00:03:01,94
There is fortunately this. Never amounted to anything. I think. Other than a bit of a worry on my part. That something.

17
00:03:01,94 --> 00:03:11,35
Unfortunate could happen that way. Because by about nineteen eighty six or seven i'm not quite sure which.

18
00:03:11,35 --> 00:03:22,56
Council had at last. Agreed to accept the possibility of allowing multiple occupancies.

19
00:03:22,56 --> 00:03:35,56
In this particular corner of the issue. Now the. Once they were in a position to accept. Multiple occupancies.

20
00:03:35,56 --> 00:03:48,37
As a legal way of use. Land use. We were able to submit. Application for multiple occupancy. This.

21
00:03:48,37 --> 00:03:57,54
Put them into a slight slightly awkward position because they were already. Say well.

22
00:03:57,54 --> 00:04:08,46
Many many more houses built on that land than. Were legally allowed under the old scheme. But. They had enough.

23
00:04:08,46 --> 00:04:23,61
Gentleness and sense. To sort of a point or a very. Isn't building inspector who gave us. Reasonable.

24
00:04:23,61 --> 00:04:25,07
Attentions says that.

25
00:04:25,07 --> 00:04:33,56
Allow those certain aspects of most of the had to have something done to them to bring them up to his satisfaction.

26
00:04:33,56 --> 00:04:44,21
And ordinance. Seventy. We didn't really suffer too much. From that side of complying with the legal structure.

27
00:04:44,21 --> 00:04:57,71
So legally. Each member of community has one share. Has one heard.

28
00:04:57,71 --> 00:05:13,16
And has the right to dispose of his or her house and. General area. Liking. Garden.

29
00:05:13,16 --> 00:05:18,22
Prague garden that has been established only.

30
00:05:18,22 --> 00:05:25,42
To someone who is approved by one hundred percent of the rest of the community.

31
00:05:28,16 --> 00:05:36,00
We have had one situation where this is already happened. It does.

32
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:43,91
It did because a problem for the for the people who wanted to move away. Because they couldn't sell their things.

33
00:05:43,91 --> 00:05:53,72
Their house. On the open market. They couldn't ask. As much as they would have got on the connecticut.

34
00:05:53,72 --> 00:06:05,28
And it took them. Much longer. Probably than it would have the say. I just left it on the open market. But.

35
00:06:05,28 --> 00:06:14,3
This is something we all agreed to. Initially that. These are the conditions. So that. I mean that.

36
00:06:14,3 --> 00:06:32,41
There are some disadvantages in that since this is not an investment. The place to live in that is very high priority.

37
00:06:32,77 --> 00:06:47,89
Yes it's very important to us that we. We we've always tried to put. Relationship. Among community members. Absolutely.

38
00:06:47,89 --> 00:07:02,24
At the top priority. Doesn't matter bet. Anything else really. If your relationship good. And of course.

39
00:07:02,24 --> 00:07:14,81
The longer you can live. And share this. Live beside each other and share. The land or anything.

40
00:07:14,81 --> 00:07:22,2
The longer you can do that and make a billy. The mole. Easy it becomes.

41
00:07:22,2 --> 00:07:34,99
So that now i think there is a very strong bond. A bonding that is sort of. You know getting towards something like.

42
00:07:34,99 --> 00:07:41,06
You get between brothers and sisters or family. I hesitate to use that word.

43
00:07:41,06 --> 00:07:51,01
Family because it becomes rather a potentially. Nasty label in some communities. Doesn't it.

44
00:07:51,01 --> 00:08:01,08
But it certainly seems to work. That. There's a good deal of support for each other if.

45
00:08:01,08 --> 00:08:09,91
If somebody is sick or somebody. Well. When. When anyone has a baby. That the tradition. Has become that.

46
00:08:09,91 --> 00:08:20,11
They get their a meal. An evening meal. Prepared and delivered for. Fortnight after the birth. And we take it.

47
00:08:20,11 --> 00:08:30,45
We just take it intends to do that and i mean that. That's nothing but they just. There is lots of other support.

48
00:08:30,45 --> 00:08:50,09
Sort of awareness of each other and awareness of shopping needs transport needs hills. It's it's it's a good one.

49
00:08:50,09 --> 00:09:00,98
I actually wish it. Listen live it. Ideally you know. I must confess that. At first and i thought community i thought.

50
00:09:00,98 --> 00:09:12,78
Working side by side in the gardens. You know producing things and working together. Projects. Be great. Now.

51
00:09:12,78 --> 00:09:25,72
We come together. For social reasons. Party. This. Days. We come together to swim. In our big dam. In summer.

52
00:09:25,72 --> 00:09:38,73
Which is a lovely. Escape place. We come together. Almost unfortunate occasions when we get a groundswell notice.

53
00:09:38,9 --> 00:09:54,64
And also and have to show some signs of doing something to placate the. The rather than the rather absurd request.

54
00:09:54,64 --> 00:10:13,4
To eradicate this. The days of potential danger to some people or. Some graziers any way. We come together is if.

55
00:10:14,17 --> 00:10:29,77
There is a request to come together. But. We have a monthly meeting to discuss various business. Usually attended by.

56
00:10:29,77 --> 00:10:39,16
That twenty percent. Maybe sometimes. Thirty or forty percent of the people but very rarely that it's.

57
00:10:39,16 --> 00:11:01,31
Everybody comes to meetings. And yes i do think the did. Changed over the years. At first we did.

58
00:11:01,31 --> 00:11:08,94
I think share an ideal or. A fantasy that you know we would be working side by side and.

59
00:11:08,94 --> 00:11:20,45
We did have a community garden going for a while and. It just it seemed not to be the way.

60
00:11:20,45 --> 00:11:31,08
We as people worked a bit as people moved into their own home.

61
00:11:31,08 --> 00:11:36,94
Which was separate from each other they found it was more successful.

62
00:11:36,94 --> 00:11:44,72
Useful to have their own gardens near their houses. Then they could choose what they wanted to plan.

63
00:11:44,72 --> 00:11:57,16
They wouldn't have to go. Sort of three hundred yards away carrying the tools. Is it. It has just generally changed.

64
00:11:57,48 --> 00:12:05,38
That's that side of his day much as we used to run a shop for ourselves. Come to think of it. We had. We.

65
00:12:05,38 --> 00:12:20,36
We did weekly purchasing we had been full of. Oh gosh. So everybody. Chickpeas. We all get acquitted of course.

66
00:12:20,36 --> 00:12:33,35
We had a great week grinding meal because we all made our own brit. Ernest. Lots of things that we've and that.

67
00:12:33,35 --> 00:12:41,97
I think it was partly that. The payment system we had a book. We ended everything in.

68
00:12:41,97 --> 00:12:50,7
But there was then really enough money in the. Kitty. When we came to do the next lot of purchasing.

69
00:12:50,7 --> 00:12:59,14
Not because anybody had been dishonest or did. It's just that it wasn't convenient for them and. At the time.

70
00:12:59,87 --> 00:13:08,73
Says that over a period of a couple of years of trying to run this thing for us. We decided that.

71
00:13:08,73 --> 00:13:31,88
It just would be easier. At that time to let it go. What was just you know.

72
00:13:31,88 --> 00:13:57,82
I think we probably have each come to our assessment of an energy level. And have that. It's more convenient.

73
00:13:57,82 --> 00:14:01,09
To do things under our own steam.

74
00:14:01,09 --> 00:14:13,4
Rather than to try to combine with each other the amount of energy needed to organize a shopping list. Among.

75
00:14:13,75 --> 00:14:27,99
Twenty people each week. To to do the purchasing is to distribute the product. To get the pay back.

76
00:14:27,99 --> 00:14:37,23
To get the money for the next weeks. All of that energy. Just seemed to be too much for any one person.

77
00:14:37,23 --> 00:14:50,84
To take are so it has boiled down to each family. Seems to have its own transport system anyway.

78
00:14:50,84 --> 00:15:00,09
He has to go to the shops. Sometime during a week or fortnight.

79
00:15:01,36 --> 00:15:10,89
It just has boiled down to the fact that each individual family now does it. Does that side of things. Good still.

80
00:15:10,89 --> 00:15:22,72
Mind you. If we go to a major crisis in the pickle supplies or a major shift in the whole economic system.

81
00:15:22,72 --> 00:15:30,19
So that there is a lot less money to go around and lot less petrol to go around.

82
00:15:30,19 --> 00:15:36,28
I wouldn't be surprised if we wouldn't be forced to get back into some sort of system like that again.

83
00:15:38,59 --> 00:15:51,44
So i can say that it's due to personal. Laziness or just. Failure of that ideal.

84
00:15:51,44 --> 00:16:15,65
It's just the way things have happened. You know so you can stay. And this was with them at that. I know men.

85
00:16:15,65 --> 00:16:35,12
Very often used to think this is just another suburban plot. I think. Know that it's moved beyond that.

86
00:16:35,12 --> 00:16:47,09
I think it's the community side of things the support of each member. For each other member.

87
00:16:47,09 --> 00:16:58,69
Perhaps that support isn't called for more than very occasionally. But when i was sort of with a go.

88
00:16:58,69 --> 00:17:12,93
If you need something. Or if you need a shoulder to cry on or if you need some information for fixing something.

89
00:17:12,93 --> 00:17:26,77
And i think. I think one of the values that. In this community is that he who is enough. Right into the skilled sorry.

90
00:17:26,77 --> 00:17:48,91
So yes. This certainly is a feeling that. We want to support each other when anything happens to any individual.

91
00:17:48,91 --> 00:17:55,36
This does of course is. Support. If anybody's. Sick or hurt or.

92
00:17:55,36 --> 00:18:09,38
If as occasionally happens the sort of relationship problems or break downs. There is not as not blame is just.

93
00:18:09,38 --> 00:18:14,73
Support for each individual. Because of course we like. Each individual.

94
00:18:16,23 --> 00:18:34,51
This is sounding like a sunday school something is becoming you know. Situation. So personally i don't think it does.

95
00:18:34,51 --> 00:18:44,49
It may well be that some. Some individuals. Think that person ought to behave themselves. In which case it's.

96
00:18:44,49 --> 00:18:50,66
It's their responsibility to say that. To that person and not say it to anybody else. That.

97
00:18:50,66 --> 00:19:01,62
This is something that we've tried to follow all along. Is if. I have a grudge against somebody else in the community.

98
00:19:01,62 --> 00:19:13,03
Or if i think they're doing something i don't like. I have to try to say to myself. Is this worth while.

99
00:19:13,03 --> 00:19:21,17
Just accepting. Ok that's them. That's the way they like to do things or. Is it better for me to go to that person.

100
00:19:21,17 --> 00:19:30,44
And because they know me i know them as a friend. Say. I don't like that or. Why you doing there.

101
00:19:30,44 --> 00:19:39,76
Or you wake me up in the mornings when you do that. Now just to make. Each other aware.

102
00:19:39,76 --> 00:19:49,14
If there is something that is irritating. And then it's up to us as individuals to work that out between us.

103
00:19:49,14 --> 00:20:08,66
What we try to avoid and i think successfully use. Talking about that you would buy wonders. Talking about that.

104
00:20:08,66 --> 00:20:20,17
To other people. So that when it starts going around. And round in circles. So i think that's one way that perhaps.

105
00:20:20,17 --> 00:20:35,91
We've tried to keep each other. Aware of where we're possibly. Against another cell. In the community.

106
00:20:35,91 --> 00:20:53,19
Because those guys. Yes. It has had this. Fairly stable population.

107
00:20:53,19 --> 00:21:00,48
Although there have been people who have moved away for very good reasons.

108
00:21:00,48 --> 00:21:10,94
There hasn't been any big blow ups or any sort of emotional strife that seems to cause people to move away.

109
00:21:10,94 --> 00:21:32,56
They've moved away. For economic reasons or for health reasons one which you know. And yet is.

110
00:21:32,56 --> 00:21:45,77
To be economically sustainable is. Is quite a mouthful isn't it it's quieter. And that she meant. I guess with.

111
00:21:45,77 --> 00:21:56,26
Ideally we wanted that to be happening. It's taken much longer than i ever hoped they were thought it would.

112
00:21:56,26 --> 00:22:13,4
But i think that it's. It's been happening over the last several years now that people have become more and more.

113
00:22:13,96 --> 00:22:17,24
Pendant of any form of government support.

114
00:22:18,81 --> 00:22:29,65
There is still a few people on the place who are pensioners or unmarried mothers or. You know. Single parents.

115
00:22:29,65 --> 00:22:44,28
That with fear and but on the whole. Most of the. Health people and abuse ition have made jews. That they can work in.

116
00:22:44,28 --> 00:22:56,49
That will bring in a viable income. So although it's taken longer than i'd hoped all. We all hoped it. It is happening.

117
00:22:56,49 --> 00:23:08,97
And it's. I think. Another. Another sort of a fit of not having to pay rent. Of having a reasonably. Adequate.

118
00:23:08,97 --> 00:23:18,52
Was a place to live it was. Each each family. Seems to built and home.

119
00:23:19,17 --> 00:23:23,77
Gradually taking a long gun and a lot of this it.

120
00:23:23,77 --> 00:23:33,52
Since none of them was you know a qualified builder to begin with but now they've each got a reasonably comfortable

121
00:23:33,52 --> 00:23:43,84
and sound. Place to live in which is without a mortgage. And without. No overhead cost.

122
00:23:43,84 --> 00:24:09,89
So that that in itself helps to make it possible to make a living out of either the kraftwerk or the music.

123
00:24:09,89 --> 00:24:26,92
You know who's really. I wouldn't you know i mean. Yeah i would actually do it is all there are cliche.

124
00:24:27,1 --> 00:24:37,92
Ok yeah that can i tell you bruce mcnichol and be a good one to talk to about that. You know him as a musician.
