1
00:00:01,58 --> 00:00:26,07
I've never seen it with the speed just as you. And i k. I'm jenny del i lived at nimbin for eleven years.

2
00:00:26,07 --> 00:00:35,32
From nine hundred seventy four. Having arrived from england. And i had come to australia.

3
00:00:35,32 --> 00:00:41,23
To see if there was any form of counter culture here till i didn't want to remain living in england where i've been

4
00:00:41,23 --> 00:00:50,07
brought up and. Having arrived at puss and and then travelled on to adelaide of a sort of.

5
00:00:50,07 --> 00:00:54,43
Asking everywhere i went if there was any alternative culture.

6
00:00:54,43 --> 00:00:58,17
Around australia and it turned out that it was a year after the.

7
00:00:58,17 --> 00:01:02,56
Aquarius festival had been held at nimbin and the closer i got to the eastern states.

8
00:01:02,75 --> 00:01:09,37
The more people were saying oh you should check out nimbin. So i arrived here.

9
00:01:09,37 --> 00:01:15,71
Actually on my way to the as a tin table and which i thought would be a nice place to go and look at it and godhood.

10
00:01:15,71 --> 00:01:22,02
Also alternative lifestyle as. Living up there too. And the.

11
00:01:22,02 --> 00:01:27,85
Arrived in nimbin on a sunday afternoon and went into the craft shop and asked ways the commune and.

12
00:01:27,85 --> 00:01:35,77
Everybody fell about laughing because that was what everyone who arrived at nieman always used to us as a commune and.

13
00:01:35,77 --> 00:01:42,36
The only commune. At that time was not strictly speaking a commune but a co-operative.

14
00:01:42,36 --> 00:01:49,42
That had been bought immediately after the. Aquarius festival. It was about. At that time.

15
00:01:49,42 --> 00:01:57,13
Twelve hundred acres of land in a valley that had once had a sawmill at the end of it so.

16
00:01:57,13 --> 00:02:01,75
There was quite a lot of tree loss and. On the land already.

17
00:02:02,79 --> 00:02:12,36
But it had been sold by a guy called sam a come to a co-operative of. I think it was nine hundred shareholders.

18
00:02:13,35 --> 00:02:15,17
After the aquarius festival and.

19
00:02:15,17 --> 00:02:22,76
And set up as a sort of piece of liberated land in a way that was no longer on the open market.

20
00:02:22,76 --> 00:02:30,01
But that foot two hundred dollars and a fifty dollar joining fee. One could become a shareholder and.

21
00:02:30,01 --> 00:02:40,16
And part of this extraordinary experiment in. Land ownership and. I arrived there with a caravan and.

22
00:02:40,16 --> 00:02:48,75
A husband and two children. And we lived in the caravan for the first six months or so that we were there.

23
00:02:48,75 --> 00:02:54,59
And then we're lucky enough to be able to move into one of the very few. Existing houses. On the property.

24
00:02:54,59 --> 00:02:58,99
I think there were probably four or five old.

25
00:02:58,99 --> 00:03:03,64
Ramshackle houses that had been pretty much derelict when the land was bought.

26
00:03:04,67 --> 00:03:07,65
And we lived in one of those

27
00:03:07,65 --> 00:03:14,5
and were considered also very lucky to have such a large roof over our heads because at that time.

28
00:03:14,5 --> 00:03:16,43
It was very tough to tumble fools.

29
00:03:16,43 --> 00:03:24,55
It was the only part of nine hundred seventy four that was the worst what season that people could remember a few years

30
00:03:24,55 --> 00:03:31,75
news news. And. Most people who moved on to the land were living in temporary shelters or caravans a tent so.

31
00:03:31,75 --> 00:03:35,53
Whatever they could sort of scrape together to keep the rain off them.

32
00:03:36,23 --> 00:03:41,11
And basically survival was the name of the game nobody had very much money.

33
00:03:42,03 --> 00:03:53,5
And so in a way we were very dependent on each other for help and support and transport. Because i knew one.

34
00:03:53,5 --> 00:03:59,99
Family and maybe five or six would actually have reliable transportation. And at that time tangible and one big truck.

35
00:04:00,66 --> 00:04:10,04
Which frequently used to be used to take everyone to a dance or a party or. To the beach at the weekend or whatever.

36
00:04:10,04 --> 00:04:24,76
When just straight. Well. I had a very precise impression of what it was i wanted the way that i wanted to live and.

37
00:04:24,76 --> 00:04:31,04
Sitting up in the north of england. Through a very cold winter in one thousand nine hundred eighty three.

38
00:04:31,04 --> 00:04:34,53
I looked at will that lasse's. To see.

39
00:04:34,53 --> 00:04:39,75
On many levels where i would be the best place on the planet for me to live that would be possible for me to live

40
00:04:39,75 --> 00:04:42,37
because of. You know immigration.

41
00:04:42,37 --> 00:04:49,71
Allowances and that sort of stuff so i was a track to two definitely a warm climate i wanted to be somewhere warm

42
00:04:49,71 --> 00:04:54,07
when i first looked at what used to be called british hundred years.

43
00:04:54,07 --> 00:05:01,82
Which is now billy's in central america and that is very appealing and i looked into that very carefully and.

44
00:05:01,82 --> 00:05:08,36
But from those investigations it looked as if you know. To live the way that i wanted to live.

45
00:05:08,36 --> 00:05:16,99
Would be quite difficult there. Because of the. You know sort of political situation in central and south america and.

46
00:05:16,99 --> 00:05:25,49
At that time most radia had a white just really a policy. It had conscription. And it was involved in the vietnam war.

47
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:31,82
And all of that all of those things were most unappealing to me and.

48
00:05:31,82 --> 00:05:36,55
Particularly conscription because i had a baby son and.

49
00:05:36,55 --> 00:05:40,16
So i had to discount it destroyed you know as i for an english person who wanted to go

50
00:05:40,16 --> 00:05:46,57
and live in a warm climate it was the obvious place to choose but then a lot of television

51
00:05:46,57 --> 00:05:51,88
and radio coverage was given in england to go for it limbs campaign. For election.

52
00:05:52,57 --> 00:05:59,99
I guess it was nine hundred seventy three and. I watched that and was very interested in this guy.

53
00:06:00,03 --> 00:06:05,66
He was very favorably portrayed in the english media and.

54
00:06:05,66 --> 00:06:12,12
When he was elected and announced an amnesty for draft dodgers and the end of the white australia policy.

55
00:06:12,12 --> 00:06:19,62
I thought that's it. I'm going to australia. That that. It's the place i want to be. But in terms of.

56
00:06:19,62 --> 00:06:23,67
Counterculture i didn't know what would what would be existing here but i didn't know.

57
00:06:23,67 --> 00:06:34,57
That i wanted to live in an area well away from. Major cities. Where it will be possible to grow one set of food. With.

58
00:06:34,57 --> 00:06:38,25
I even had a sort of. Pretty clear idea of the kind of landscape.

59
00:06:38,25 --> 00:06:47,03
That i'd like to live in which was hills with lots of fresh running water. Not too far from the coast and.

60
00:06:47,03 --> 00:06:54,71
That i would want to be living in close proximity to a large number of like minded people.

61
00:06:54,71 --> 00:06:58,71
But not necessarily in a communal household.

62
00:06:58,71 --> 00:07:05,61
As such because i've had some experience of communal living in england and. Had found that for other people.

63
00:07:05,61 --> 00:07:10,85
More than for myself. Young children in a communal household can be quite a problem.

64
00:07:10,85 --> 00:07:17,11
Because parents have different ways of bringing kids up and so on and. It could lead to friction and difficulty.

65
00:07:17,39 --> 00:07:26,96
So my vision was that i would have my own little sort of. Unit. With my kids but very close to an co-operative.

66
00:07:26,96 --> 00:07:33,23
A large group of other people and. So it turned out that. When i arrived at nimbin.

67
00:07:33,23 --> 00:07:40,73
Exactly that was starting to grow there and. It was so close to to my vision of how i wanted to live.

68
00:07:40,73 --> 00:07:45,25
I couldn't have been closer it was exactly the sort of ideas that i'd had.

69
00:07:46,04 --> 00:07:58,12
So i felt immediately connected to the people here as if you know. This was like a long lost family or something and.

70
00:07:58,12 --> 00:08:07,08
I'm very quickly. Settled in. To living here. And in those days. Really. None of us. Had anything.

71
00:08:07,08 --> 00:08:12,39
You know we were all very poor. We had no money we had no jobs.

72
00:08:13,15 --> 00:08:21,54
We were pretty dependent on government benefits in the early days as well which is you know.

73
00:08:21,54 --> 00:08:27,47
An aspect of of nimbin life that i've had many differing positions on and.

74
00:08:27,47 --> 00:08:31,6
The one i feel now is quite different from the one i had then i guess.

75
00:08:31,6 --> 00:08:39,00
But in the early days we look to the dole as a form of rural subsidy where it allowed.

76
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:42,32
People like us selves to establish ourselves.

77
00:08:42,32 --> 00:08:50,7
On degraded land and there's no doubt that the land was terribly degraded by use of over. Grazing.

78
00:08:50,7 --> 00:08:59,56
And being used this past year in the daring kathleen destry. And also from being overlooked and eroded because of that.

79
00:08:59,56 --> 00:09:09,6
So we felt that we were there to put something back into the land and. And also take the land. Off.

80
00:09:09,6 --> 00:09:19,5
The the endless cycle of capitalism. And property. As in length being. Being a sort of form of currency. That.

81
00:09:19,5 --> 00:09:23,96
By the very active put using it cooperatively and having rules that said.

82
00:09:23,96 --> 00:09:30,25
It could never be sold without everyone's agreement we actually took a lend out of that situation.

83
00:09:30,25 --> 00:09:36,79
Which was you know ideologically. An agreement that we all had and one of the very few things that we will agree john.

84
00:09:38,48 --> 00:09:47,46
And i think because we was so poor that we had to depend on each other and we had to.

85
00:09:47,46 --> 00:09:54,79
We had to live very closely together and share an awful lot of things that. Suburban families and people.

86
00:09:54,79 --> 00:09:59,99
You know who live sort of ordinary lives in the outside world. Doesn't share it and.

87
00:10:01,43 --> 00:10:08,51
That's a very texan thing to do and it doesn't always not always a smooth path.

88
00:10:09,25 --> 00:10:17,36
And i think looking back on those early years of time to bill foles in the mid to late seventy's. The.

89
00:10:17,36 --> 00:10:23,57
The stuff that we learned about living with other people about human nature.

90
00:10:23,57 --> 00:10:30,12
About us about tolerance and compassion and.

91
00:10:30,12 --> 00:10:38,86
Sort of looking at something from other people's points of view and from many points of view. Was it was beyond price.

92
00:10:38,86 --> 00:10:46,9
I can't imagine a better training than than that and it seems now that the children who were babies.

93
00:10:46,9 --> 00:10:58,76
And now in their late teens and early twenty's. Have grown up steeped in that culture and. Have in the. Into the world.

94
00:10:58,76 --> 00:11:00,21
Incredibly enraged.

95
00:11:00,21 --> 00:11:07,47
And i'm not you know any comparison is odious but i really think that that the kids that grew up that.

96
00:11:07,47 --> 00:11:15,19
Joining that time and surrounded by that kind of activity have to have something extra you know that other kids.

97
00:11:15,19 --> 00:11:32,3
Unfortunately. You know. Don't have unless they've lived in in very special circumstances will say.

98
00:11:32,3 --> 00:11:38,13
Well i sing i think that was one of the reasons why i did would the fact that it was very hard to make rules and.

99
00:11:38,13 --> 00:11:44,89
And have everybody agreeing on the same issues i think was one of the reasons why it was possible for everyone to stay

100
00:11:44,89 --> 00:11:52,46
there because i think if there had been a very rigid structure. Then it wouldn't have. We would too individualistic.

101
00:11:52,46 --> 00:11:57,07
And it wouldn't have worked and people. People would have fought to hide.

102
00:11:57,07 --> 00:11:59,99
But interestingly although i've just sort of eulogized how wonderful.

103
00:12:00,04 --> 00:12:06,5
The effect of it was on the kids that there was things about kids that if that for me didn't work and in fact.

104
00:12:06,5 --> 00:12:13,75
Constitutes a reason why i left. Tumble fulls off to two years. And that was that.

105
00:12:15,57 --> 00:12:21,83
It was very nice a fit and anything goes with kids and.

106
00:12:21,83 --> 00:12:29,72
I was a parent to who i was choosing the counter-culture i was choosing. You know. To reduce.

107
00:12:29,72 --> 00:12:38,32
Everywhere i could around me the films of all sorrow and dominance. That. I was wanting to expel from my life.

108
00:12:38,32 --> 00:12:46,62
At the same time. I felt that. To bring children up within the boundaries and no limits.

109
00:12:46,62 --> 00:12:51,69
Was quite a confusing thing to do. And it was putting too much responsibility on tiny children.

110
00:12:51,69 --> 00:12:55,09
To constantly be giving them choices.

111
00:12:55,09 --> 00:13:01,53
About what time they went to bed or you know how far they could roam or whether they got home before dark or norseman.

112
00:13:01,53 --> 00:13:04,76
I'm talking about. You know children from eighteen months.

113
00:13:04,76 --> 00:13:09,79
Up to say six years old because there weren't many a time to play at that time who were older than six might be wanted

114
00:13:09,79 --> 00:13:18,82
to but not many and my children were very small and the children ran in a pack and that was terrific and.

115
00:13:18,82 --> 00:13:24,41
It was you know. There were many advantages in that. But there were also disadvantages. In that.

116
00:13:24,41 --> 00:13:31,64
I felt some other parents weren't quite as. King to take responsibility for their kids' whereabouts and activities.

117
00:13:31,64 --> 00:13:44,00
As i was and. I was in very much a minority in wanting to set limits around my kids. And in the end. It happened that.

118
00:13:44,00 --> 00:13:51,03
Doc nice fella and. Barney he was an eighteen months old. Had been out with the kids all day and.

119
00:13:51,03 --> 00:13:55,27
I didn't know why she was it had been writing the creek was up.

120
00:13:55,27 --> 00:14:02,38
It was a worrying time and a tumble when it's dark it's stuck. No lighting. The street lights ringing.

121
00:14:02,38 --> 00:14:11,24
And i went across the creek to the family whose children she was. I knew she was and they were all stunned. And i said.

122
00:14:11,24 --> 00:14:17,62
You know. Bunny hasn't come home and i'm really worried. And they all loved and said it's cool.

123
00:14:17,62 --> 00:14:22,84
And i thought no i've had enough of this i don't i don't want to live like this is scary and.

124
00:14:22,84 --> 00:14:30,08
She got home and she was ok. But all the same. I began to feel that you know.

125
00:14:30,08 --> 00:14:35,95
I really needed to get the kids away from a situation like that now.

126
00:14:35,95 --> 00:14:39,07
That was a decision i had to make for my own peace of mind and it.

127
00:14:39,07 --> 00:14:45,5
And it doesn't mean to say that children who remained in that situation haven't emerged. Just as wonderful and.

128
00:14:45,5 --> 00:14:49,21
You know. To refute kids is as could be.

129
00:14:49,21 --> 00:14:54,12
But for me it was a bit too uncomfortable specific me that was one thing that didn't what.

130
00:14:59,37 --> 00:15:06,01
Well it was a natural part of life. You know it was it was a part of life it was part of everybody's life.

131
00:15:06,01 --> 00:15:13,87
I can't think of anyone who had no experience no that wouldn't of been anyone who had no experience of being smoked

132
00:15:13,87 --> 00:15:24,54
around them. And there wouldn't have been many people who wouldn't. You know have a type of the joined as it went by.

133
00:15:24,54 --> 00:15:28,96
But at that time. Also very importantly in that context.

134
00:15:28,96 --> 00:15:34,46
There was only one person that i knew of at that time who lived on timetable fulls who went to the pub.

135
00:15:34,46 --> 00:15:39,52
Who drank a chill. I mean. Occasionally people. Would have a drink.

136
00:15:39,52 --> 00:15:41,68
I knew the guys would have a beer or something like that

137
00:15:41,68 --> 00:15:46,03
but it was only one person who i would have identified who had a drinking problem. You know who drank.

138
00:15:46,03 --> 00:15:55,43
All the time and got drunk and abusive and horrible. And. And it was. Nobody nobody thought of going to the pub it was.

139
00:15:55,43 --> 00:16:03,23
It wasn't part of our culture to go to the pub. As time went by. I that changed quite dramatically. Right.

140
00:16:04,06 --> 00:16:11,32
But on occasions with. I remember when there was a big. Police bust attended by nine hundred seventy eight.

141
00:16:11,32 --> 00:16:16,52
And everyone was taken into his war and kept in custody all die and then they were let out in the evening

142
00:16:16,52 --> 00:16:24,54
and then they all went to the pub and. They all got drunk and. They ate. They came back in the town to the red truck.

143
00:16:24,54 --> 00:16:30,47
And you could hear the truck when it hit the top of the valley and. From where i live that was about two miles away.

144
00:16:30,47 --> 00:16:36,59
And you could hear them singing in the truck as they came down the valley and. They were incredibly drunk.

145
00:16:36,59 --> 00:16:40,18
And i'd never seen that before and it was the only and.

146
00:16:40,18 --> 00:16:47,2
Oh since actually i've never seen a whole lot of tunnel people incredibly drunk. All in a big panic.

147
00:16:47,2 --> 00:16:53,06
That was very unusual.

148
00:16:53,06 --> 00:16:58,93
The drug bust was it was a day buckle from beginning to end but at the time it was very frightening.

149
00:16:58,93 --> 00:17:06,83
At that time i suppose it would have been about him and about two hundred people living at a time to pull in various.

150
00:17:06,83 --> 00:17:13,61
Doings some houses in close to construction some existing houses and tents and so on

151
00:17:13,61 --> 00:17:19,82
and it was a simple tiny is right on several pumps of the community because we had established little hamlets which

152
00:17:19,82 --> 00:17:27,00
were like tiny villages in the valley. That were clustered around central facilities like you know washing up and.

153
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:36,62
Shower and toilet facilities and. The police arrived. Before dawn. It was a commando style. Right they were in the.

154
00:17:36,62 --> 00:17:44,41
There was some uniformed and some. Plainclothes police. There i didn't sort of trucks like coverage.

155
00:17:44,41 --> 00:17:48,49
Trucks and sort of.

156
00:17:48,49 --> 00:17:55,28
The ones that came down to me where i lived at the north and a short distance from where i was living.

157
00:17:55,28 --> 00:17:59,99
And right next to the house of. The guy who'd originally owned the land and still hadn't.

158
00:18:00,21 --> 00:18:05,04
And after he had sold it that he could live there until his day and.

159
00:18:05,04 --> 00:18:14,58
The first person to become away it before doing that they were there was his housekeeper who was a middle aged. Nimbin.

160
00:18:14,58 --> 00:18:18,85
Secular as she was that you were an original person of the area.

161
00:18:18,85 --> 00:18:20,91
Who had never had anything to do with marrow honor

162
00:18:20,91 --> 00:18:26,42
and who his life had been quite changed by the advent of two hundred hippies into her backyard.

163
00:18:26,42 --> 00:18:33,2
But she was a most loving and compassionate and tolerant woman and. Very friendly was all of this very kind.

164
00:18:33,2 --> 00:18:39,23
And it was her birthday and. She woke up. To to see this. Shadow of a truck.

165
00:18:39,23 --> 00:18:43,64
Coming under the trees and then these figures in uniforms with guns.

166
00:18:43,64 --> 00:18:51,71
Jumping out of the truck and she was absolutely terrified. As well you'll as these guys. You know approached.

167
00:18:51,71 --> 00:18:59,14
Various doing so and. You know came in and intent everything upside down looking for marijuana.

168
00:18:59,14 --> 00:19:04,39
Which i when you think back on it. It was very foolish it was august. You know.

169
00:19:04,39 --> 00:19:12,85
And i mean anyone who knows anything about the marijuana growing season would not come looking for anything you know.

170
00:19:12,85 --> 00:19:16,92
Any way they came and. Course they found little.

171
00:19:16,92 --> 00:19:26,13
Stashes of little ends of joints and stuff in practically every house they visited. Naturally. And.

172
00:19:26,13 --> 00:19:31,6
And they took people from just about every household into. Lismore and.

173
00:19:31,6 --> 00:19:35,75
Fingerprinted and photographed and charge them all with position and.

174
00:19:35,75 --> 00:19:41,53
I wasn't among the people arrested but there were people in my household who would taken it and.

175
00:19:41,53 --> 00:19:47,14
I mean the whole thing was terribly frightening and there was so many young children attend to bill at that time and.

176
00:19:47,14 --> 00:19:53,66
One of their early childhood experience used to be a commando style right on their home and the removal of.

177
00:19:53,66 --> 00:20:01,44
Significant adults in their life from their environment. People who they'd experienced as being homeless humor. Yes.

178
00:20:01,44 --> 00:20:09,45
Gentle people had to be so violently removed from their homes was was really a shocking thing to happen.

179
00:20:10,04 --> 00:20:12,45
And you know i mean none of us were living there.

180
00:20:12,45 --> 00:20:21,78
In order to subject our kids and ourselves to that kind of shocking violence. But it happened. And eventually the.

181
00:20:21,78 --> 00:20:29,47
Due process was observed and everyone had to appear in court and the scene at the lismore courthouse on the day

182
00:20:29,47 --> 00:20:36,66
when the charges were to be on said was extraordinary we had musicians and dances and.

183
00:20:36,66 --> 00:20:45,35
People looking beautiful and soaks and settings and a festival atmosphere inside the coach house and.

184
00:20:45,35 --> 00:20:50,57
And some pretty smart lawyers from sydney as well and a barrister and.

185
00:20:50,57 --> 00:20:58,01
It was discovered quite early in the piece that the original warrant. Had actually been invalid.

186
00:20:58,01 --> 00:21:04,92
And the police ended up with egg on their faces and all the charges had to be dropped and. Nothing came of it.

187
00:21:04,92 --> 00:21:13,49
But what remained was the fact that we had been violated. That the community had been violated.

188
00:21:13,49 --> 00:21:18,4
Sure it may be that you know if we had been breaking we lure in a big way

189
00:21:18,4 --> 00:21:25,00
or the been anyone living there who at that time was making enormous amounts of money out of growing marijuana.

190
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:28,87
That there might have been a little more excuse for it in their wallets.

191
00:21:29,24 --> 00:21:38,88
But i suppose it's the sort of tax you pay on on turning your back on some of the rules of the society.

192
00:21:38,88 --> 00:21:48,57
And deciding that you can set up under a different set of rules. And we certainly paid that tax. Subsequent is.

193
00:21:48,57 --> 00:21:58,32
There were people in that area. Who were growing a lot of marijuana for profit and.

194
00:21:58,32 --> 00:22:04,5
That's you know felt very good to me either. It you know. As that started to happen i'm.

195
00:22:04,5 --> 00:22:11,46
I began to feel that i wasn't really interested in that either. You know. And of course a lot of this now.

196
00:22:11,46 --> 00:22:21,99
Who were you know into the culture then i'm not seeing it now. I mean we've grown out of it or you know whatever.

197
00:22:21,99 --> 00:22:32,13
But it did become. I think a little over represented at nieman and certainly over represented there now and.

198
00:22:32,13 --> 00:22:40,00
It's a problem that. That's become a problem where in the very early years. It was actually part of the solution.

199
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:44,98
It wasn't a problem a tool and in fact a lot of people are not a lot of people but.

200
00:22:44,98 --> 00:22:52,35
You know a good dozen or so people came to name been in order to get away from the cities. Who had been drug addicted.

201
00:22:52,35 --> 00:22:57,44
In the past to hunt drugs like heroin specifically.

202
00:22:57,44 --> 00:23:00,69
And they came to name been in order to be away from that culture

203
00:23:00,69 --> 00:23:06,18
and successfully stayed away from it because there wasn't any heroin at nieman

204
00:23:06,18 --> 00:23:16,22
and the little marijuana that people grew and. Sort of shared among themselves. Was. Was used in much the same way as.

205
00:23:16,22 --> 00:23:24,07
People have a drinks cabinet you can allow households and. It was a form of relaxation and.

206
00:23:24,07 --> 00:23:28,99
You know some people used it as a creative stimulant or whatever.

207
00:23:28,99 --> 00:23:37,57
And i didn't seem to be such a problem but over the years a lot of people became very dependent on it and.

208
00:23:37,57 --> 00:23:43,1
You know i don't believe you can really be addicted to marijuana and this you are an addictive personality and.

209
00:23:43,1 --> 00:23:49,54
You know if it wasn't marijuana it would be something else. But certainly some of the behavior is.

210
00:23:49,54 --> 00:23:57,13
Later on when when there are people who become habituated over many years to using large quantities of marijuana.

211
00:23:57,13 --> 00:24:04,27
That begin to look at you know a bit weird because. It does tend to zap you of motivation and.

212
00:24:04,27 --> 00:24:18,57
Energy and perhaps have been achieved without it. When i really don't know.

213
00:24:18,57 --> 00:24:25,41
But i would say that it certainly wasn't until the eighties. And i don't know how far into the eighty's.

214
00:24:25,81 --> 00:24:28,78
It's quite an extraordinary thing for me personally that.

215
00:24:28,78 --> 00:24:35,16
You know despite having been part of the counterculture for so long and having known heaps of junkies and.

216
00:24:35,16 --> 00:24:42,00
You know people who. Been using i've never actually seen heroin. In my whole life. And so.

217
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:52,16
I really i only became conscious so much i suppose about eighty to eighty three. That there were people who were using.

218
00:24:52,16 --> 00:24:57,49
Or at least tasting. You know it's not like she regularly uses.

219
00:24:57,49 --> 00:25:01,99
I think it was around that time that i became aware that. One of the daughter of.

220
00:25:01,99 --> 00:25:06,22
Some people that i sort of didn't know. Really well but i knew quite well.

221
00:25:06,22 --> 00:25:12,64
And i had a daughter who at that time would have been about seventeen sixteen i think. And that she was using and this.

222
00:25:12,64 --> 00:25:16,68
And that seemed to me really shocking and i hadn't really been away it.

223
00:25:16,68 --> 00:25:27,72
But then i became aware that there were other adults who who had been using and that i was sharing it was.

224
00:25:27,72 --> 00:25:37,09
Yes it was in my kids who have been coming to be close to teenage and. That was very scary.

225
00:25:37,09 --> 00:25:43,16
That there was a teenager in town who you know had been offered and accepted. The use of heroin.

226
00:25:43,16 --> 00:25:53,67
It was quite alarming to me. And. Yeah. I didn't feel like it was a good place to. Just a once a kids.

227
00:25:53,67 --> 00:25:59,99
Came to be that age. Also because by that time. I was living in the main street of town. Which.

228
00:26:00,04 --> 00:26:03,99
It's a very very different situation from living out in the hills as most people did.

229
00:26:03,99 --> 00:26:08,95
That i don't think all of them may have been two or three other people living in town.

230
00:26:08,95 --> 00:26:16,44
You know who were part of the sort of new settler movement and the main street is sort of where it all happens

231
00:26:16,44 --> 00:26:20,12
and it's often said of me in the i think it's true that.

232
00:26:20,12 --> 00:26:25,26
It probably doesn't have any more problems than other places but at nimbin they're really out front.

233
00:26:25,26 --> 00:26:26,05
There on the street.

234
00:26:26,05 --> 00:26:42,96
You can see them they're not he'd no way now that he's pushed out of sight under the carpet sort of thing.

235
00:26:42,96 --> 00:26:45,08
You know i think that is one of what.

236
00:26:45,08 --> 00:26:49,76
You know why it's a problem in another way it's one of the great blessings of nimbin that that.

237
00:26:49,76 --> 00:26:59,21
That it's such a tolerant community and. So tolerant of deviance. But to. This is a sense in which.

238
00:26:59,21 --> 00:27:05,01
That was ok when we were in a you know. Early twenty's and we would.

239
00:27:05,01 --> 00:27:15,18
As a group of people we tended to throw the baby out with the bathwater. You know we'd thrown out old customs and.

240
00:27:15,18 --> 00:27:21,75
Belief systems and values set up parents had sort of instilled in us and.

241
00:27:21,75 --> 00:27:29,36
We're gradually reus simulating what seemed to be important to us and holding onto a certain.

242
00:27:29,36 --> 00:27:37,61
Perhaps a new set of values that we created for ourselves we were certainly creating a whole new culture and.

243
00:27:37,61 --> 00:27:47,78
So in that since we were very open to new definitions of what was right and wrong what was ok and not ok.

244
00:27:47,78 --> 00:27:55,74
And that was fine but i think. As we grow now. And we're now in our thirty's forty's and fifty's.

245
00:27:55,74 --> 00:28:02,09
Most of us who were there then are enough forty's now. I think we've needed. Two. To set a few more limits.

246
00:28:02,09 --> 00:28:06,01
And we've been prepared to say it and it is time for that now.

247
00:28:06,01 --> 00:28:19,45
And we haven't done quite enough of it from the other side.

248
00:28:19,45 --> 00:28:24,28
Well i hope we've grown wise that we've certainly grown old

249
00:28:24,28 --> 00:28:29,3
and that doesn't mean to say that there isn't an extraordinary. Youthfulness about his soul.

250
00:28:29,3 --> 00:28:37,48
You know for being enough forty's and fifty's was still ready at the drop of a hat for a right. Danson. You know.

251
00:28:37,48 --> 00:28:45,96
I mean we have very energetic people for this but almost unbelievable age and.

252
00:28:45,96 --> 00:28:52,56
I think there's something about having spent that is used that name and that's kept us. Mentally very youthful.

253
00:28:52,56 --> 00:29:16,53
And spiritually youthful yet. The rules of men and women on time to bull.

254
00:29:16,53 --> 00:29:25,52
In particular in the early years were not that dissimilar from. Out in the rest of society in the sense that to.

255
00:29:25,52 --> 00:29:31,88
The women tended to get the household duties and. The men tended to be out there.

256
00:29:31,88 --> 00:29:38,17
Doing whatever they did out there and. In the case of timetable that was largely a matter of clearing a site.

257
00:29:38,17 --> 00:29:45,62
And building a house and. It wasn't so much divided along sexist lines per se as.

258
00:29:45,62 --> 00:29:51,03
It was down to whose physical energy was most appropriate to the tusk.

259
00:29:51,03 --> 00:29:57,04
And given that most of the women who were there and the women many women. They were nearly all men.

260
00:29:57,04 --> 00:29:59,99
And the women who would there were generally. Either.

261
00:30:01,45 --> 00:30:10,91
Relationship with a guy or a single parent so babies were involved in nearly every case and. That being the case.

262
00:30:10,91 --> 00:30:16,17
It was most sensible for the guy to be the one who was clearing the site and building the house.

263
00:30:16,17 --> 00:30:21,16
And for the woman to be the one who was washing the nappies. In a bucket. You know with no.

264
00:30:21,16 --> 00:30:25,7
Washing machine or anything like that and. Keeping an eye on the kids.

265
00:30:25,7 --> 00:30:30,92
That's not to say that that was richard but it was generally how it filled.

266
00:30:30,92 --> 00:30:36,29
And we used to have a women's group that met in nimbin. Once a week.

267
00:30:36,29 --> 00:30:40,91
And that was the one night of the week when the guys got the kids no matter how they felt about it and.

268
00:30:40,91 --> 00:30:46,03
There was you know quite a lot of uproar about that too and.

269
00:30:46,03 --> 00:30:52,56
City feminists who visited our meeting was absolutely a pull that we you know it's us will had to fight with our guys

270
00:30:52,56 --> 00:30:57,67
to get in to look after the kids one night a week so we go to a meeting. But also the rest of it.

271
00:30:57,67 --> 00:31:06,51
Do you know that in their view it was. It was divided. So rigidly along six this law and so occupation.

272
00:31:06,51 --> 00:31:07,72
But from up point of view.

273
00:31:07,72 --> 00:31:14,64
You know i mean more than anything we come here for peace and harmony and happiness and that seemed to be.

274
00:31:14,64 --> 00:31:18,94
The way that we would you know that things would be most peaceful and how many of us.
