1
00:00:09,4 --> 00:00:23,44
You know i'm just talking about it. Around a strange thing that happened to me and. I have to read if you're you can.

2
00:00:23,44 --> 00:00:30,23
We went to jail guy and we painted in your bananas and our neighbor was a heroin match

3
00:00:30,23 --> 00:00:36,28
and telling him about how it happened that the i have a pen and the other items in the name wouldn't that.

4
00:00:36,28 --> 00:00:41,95
Sign at russian. He said. Our lease of life and the right title.

5
00:00:41,95 --> 00:00:48,08
Can i mean so he said something might happen to me and he said i'm not in the he's a child or a brother

6
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:50,25
and sister might die.

7
00:00:50,25 --> 00:00:59,5
And i thought that was rather strange thing to say that i don't need another short time out right now

8
00:00:59,5 --> 00:01:06,55
but children don't think that. And with an item i went on with q. and A back.

9
00:01:06,55 --> 00:01:18,44
Right here tonight i run a rabbit out of hand from hand to hand when i want to go into it and rather than one.

10
00:01:18,44 --> 00:01:32,08
That is really true don't know about. You know reading. I don't know if i'm old and i really need a house that night.

11
00:01:32,08 --> 00:01:35,06
And we're going to have a reception.

12
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:40,24
When not actually the reception the reception was held in tandem with the night that we were going to get away.

13
00:01:40,24 --> 00:01:42,35
Tonight. Tonight. Right now.

14
00:01:42,35 --> 00:01:49,06
For the first i had to scramble all of those down with have little insights that everything was shiny and. Plain.

15
00:01:49,06 --> 00:01:54,74
So i don't know writing by writing us that's kind of you know the name. Now. All right.

16
00:01:54,74 --> 00:02:01,86
But any right i got a letter that an amendment might add along the right price. For me nice not much crap.

17
00:02:01,86 --> 00:02:10,76
We got married to a girl. And i'm not going to have the knighting voting for an actor. We ran to a boarding house.

18
00:02:10,76 --> 00:02:13,88
And a mrs ninety had reached trade.

19
00:02:13,88 --> 00:02:19,91
And she got to the reception and that of course you're going to stay there for tonight

20
00:02:19,91 --> 00:02:27,71
and on the night is that the custom market just got up and i'm going to have the money. So then we went on the mat.

21
00:02:27,71 --> 00:02:35,19
And i said that of course. We had no moral things to raid and everything as they do here do you remember.

22
00:02:35,19 --> 00:02:43,09
An agent with the brand a praise from god because we were on his parish back

23
00:02:43,09 --> 00:02:48,84
and that in a time we didn't die at all the next day.

24
00:02:48,84 --> 00:02:55,37
And the next night when you didn't have that you dream of doing the things that were rather normal to me hang on

25
00:02:55,37 --> 00:03:07,45
and when you have a right it's a battle to happen and kind of a thing you did you'd have at the rating.

26
00:03:07,45 --> 00:03:10,07
Or kind of anything that we had.

27
00:03:10,07 --> 00:03:18,49
Yes we had and i missed him around me enough to get here and i met him that you are running beautifully here.

28
00:03:18,49 --> 00:03:23,48
Not just gonna see it need not only thing that. Didn't directly but i mean right i mean.

29
00:03:23,48 --> 00:03:29,24
And you know that that beautifully that he has seen god.

30
00:03:29,24 --> 00:03:34,46
Yes and it was dancing we had a rain that we had and i think that the name. Rainer the name.

31
00:03:34,46 --> 00:03:38,52
Sorry that your family your mother and your family. Had that.

32
00:03:38,52 --> 00:03:43,56
Hearing anything new about the backs of the running back was running on really meant to be said

33
00:03:43,56 --> 00:03:51,05
and i think it was restored in the carrier. But because i'm running because would it not stop me from that you know.

34
00:03:51,05 --> 00:03:57,84
In the morning or with custom in the morning and the right man for me when i'm in the night and the night.

35
00:03:57,84 --> 00:04:00,94
We have the mailman and your apple not.

36
00:04:00,94 --> 00:04:08,87
Not yet and i'm not having one and you know think of it this time right now we're going to are been exhausted after.

37
00:04:09,32 --> 00:04:16,65
That's right you're right about that everybody knew that you know having a sort of you know made up. It would you know.

38
00:04:16,65 --> 00:04:21,44
And gradually of mexico mccain and the younger generation come on that's you know i think.

39
00:04:21,44 --> 00:04:25,53
When you get a rating a pretty good now i'm right.

40
00:04:25,53 --> 00:04:31,6
You don't have to agree with me if you have a lot to do and i mean i don't run around. But i'm running and i think.

41
00:04:31,6 --> 00:04:39,02
Having it are about. I think that. I think some of the bigger ratings are getting to me.

42
00:04:39,02 --> 00:04:47,52
And they're kind of made everybody that i think. That is running in the rain. Right in line.

43
00:04:47,52 --> 00:04:55,64
And an enjoyment in a big meeting at the other end of the sky really expensive. Ok. Will do anything.

44
00:04:55,64 --> 00:05:04,57
That's right around the running that has nothing to gain from one of the red lights then that's just what kind of a

45
00:05:04,57 --> 00:05:09,25
nation on the right kind of. Did you. Did you prepare right.

46
00:05:09,25 --> 00:05:11,8
For many americans would have been a part of me

47
00:05:11,8 --> 00:05:15,66
when you would have gotten with on trial which would probably still not me.

48
00:05:15,66 --> 00:05:18,87
And that one of the neighing and it's last night and i said.

49
00:05:18,87 --> 00:05:26,64
You come and i've been hanging around i think i'm driving you went on the subject in the senate. With a knife.

50
00:05:26,64 --> 00:05:32,77
And you went on to borrow chicken which was that and a vegetable.

51
00:05:32,77 --> 00:05:38,31
Of mashed potatoes and time again and things not back. Then you had your breakfast chicken.

52
00:05:38,31 --> 00:05:45,94
Which went with a bang attack about it and i think i had messed with it and i have a bag vegetable.

53
00:05:45,94 --> 00:05:57,09
And then you had your story. You ran from a number of anything i took strength.

54
00:05:57,09 --> 00:06:03,55
Where writes a guy named it was me i was going to family. And it was not. X. Ray expected.

55
00:06:03,55 --> 00:06:11,45
Me only because there were not everybody really run out of luck. A lot of money i mean and.

56
00:06:11,45 --> 00:06:13,32
I mean my gratitude i strap it on

57
00:06:13,32 --> 00:06:20,4
and now that i'm about to get ready to sign it right wrecking as much as it is have these projects here and here

58
00:06:20,4 --> 00:06:29,42
and so he can rest a little he would do it but if you have your family. He got three. And already.

59
00:06:29,42 --> 00:06:34,45
And about i have a friend that i used to patronize by.

60
00:06:34,45 --> 00:06:45,22
And i had to represent not the kind of that and i mean it worked. And it kind of. Yes you can strap his mother in this.

61
00:06:45,22 --> 00:06:54,68
And i'm going to bring in here a long time and kind of an event going to the city.

62
00:06:54,68 --> 00:07:03,38
If you are right i know that eventually rolled around i know that i do not let us hear that kind of.

63
00:07:03,38 --> 00:07:08,72
What's right in the writings of x. Rays or the one that came after a little bit hanging out in his you know.

64
00:07:08,72 --> 00:07:12,15
If you can corner they need to go in and when i've been out of the press

65
00:07:12,15 --> 00:07:24,92
and let me make sure i have that they were the he was behind he had it down. I got that and probably never looks.

66
00:07:24,92 --> 00:07:31,31
And he's not and i mean this man with the looks that he had to look around and i was there

67
00:07:31,31 --> 00:07:36,1
and it's right now behind the mirror that i had and he handed it out.

68
00:07:36,1 --> 00:07:41,13
I mean i've read that when i read about it and i think we're going to have it ready

69
00:07:41,13 --> 00:07:47,69
and then i painted in the night of the need to build a little mini.

70
00:07:47,69 --> 00:07:56,67
I'm going to have an hour in a specific me on a half a second time i'm going to be there

71
00:07:56,67 --> 00:08:00,6
when by the room that would be if i was at our. Thanks and i got the ax.

72
00:08:00,6 --> 00:08:08,87
You know that night at midnight and it's not happening right now. I don't.

73
00:08:11,17 --> 00:08:21,74
No you can't right now being a boy he had it would not be returning about i'd been dancing with one of the band.

74
00:08:21,74 --> 00:08:26,46
Getting straight up to date and things straight through me and you're going to hear that which is danny

75
00:08:26,46 --> 00:08:29,31
and you know everybody.

76
00:08:29,31 --> 00:08:33,3
Really had a kind of man and woman with an endo

77
00:08:33,3 --> 00:08:44,88
and i had to figure out which i think you've been there i've met you know anyone in the room and dancing. And i said.

78
00:08:44,88 --> 00:08:53,08
I used to rules i've never tried to write a nice today. But of course. I didn't i didn't have any and that.

79
00:08:53,08 --> 00:08:58,47
I never in our women. Pick on that island dancing. Just about. Just kind of mean.

80
00:08:58,47 --> 00:09:06,25
Not a lot during that time but i knew that i wouldn't be allowed out. And it might matter and it ended united and me.

81
00:09:06,25 --> 00:09:12,78
And i went back to work. And i just didn't. There were things that you don't do.

82
00:09:12,78 --> 00:09:22,78
When you're young you're really running around in your system. You still have an email that women are about to wrap.

83
00:09:22,78 --> 00:09:25,62
I didn't know much at all when my kids were going out

84
00:09:25,62 --> 00:09:34,23
and whenever i went out to the tryst with the best i'm not there any media and it never used to get up around.

85
00:09:34,23 --> 00:09:34,96
There were.

86
00:09:34,96 --> 00:09:44,37
I had to get out of this is a good living i have a patent which i with or any other member of an astronomer about.

87
00:09:44,37 --> 00:09:56,41
To a stranger at that time never liked to run around and i can't now. He's running low. And now he's running for me.

88
00:09:56,41 --> 00:10:02,6
Yet again that to me. Anyway to do that and i didn't sign things night and in the night and every night.

89
00:10:02,6 --> 00:10:08,87
I don't think he had many of them. And they can at any.

90
00:10:09,13 --> 00:10:14,94
As you have just got to assist and about not running the system in the current system

91
00:10:14,94 --> 00:10:24,4
and see the not going on as well yeah yeah yeah. And the exercise is going to be the business driving a time machine.

92
00:10:27,13 --> 00:10:35,56
That's a battle that. I'm sure a lot of people let's just say an actor the thing is trying to flee.

93
00:10:35,56 --> 00:10:38,43
And they're not exactly. Trying to write a good.

94
00:10:38,43 --> 00:10:45,61
Lot of martin's kind that just happened a little a lot of the time you know the given ten to fifteen years things

95
00:10:45,61 --> 00:10:47,92
change that a bit in the beta.

96
00:10:47,92 --> 00:10:53,47
And it never really went back in seventy ad and it was really living well and his brother.

97
00:10:53,47 --> 00:11:01,89
Let me have and i think for me at the rate they build anything in that and then a chance in the ones that were there.

98
00:11:01,89 --> 00:11:06,41
They're not going to you know i mean. Living out anything that. Run. Yeah.

99
00:11:06,41 --> 00:11:12,62
Yeah any time even when i went back and here was the right side of that you can.

100
00:11:12,62 --> 00:11:19,03
Let it drop me and you straight in my little home town are in iran that get telling you it's chinese

101
00:11:19,03 --> 00:11:25,5
and you're chinese he said on that when i met you right. I remember that i just couldn't believe it. Yeah me.

102
00:11:25,5 --> 00:11:34,09
That green and brown that there was nothing. You know without any rhyme or in your own eyes the mystery man.

103
00:11:34,09 --> 00:11:40,29
And we went to visit them it was in the path a bad thing. That is which one they found me and i don't need.

104
00:11:40,29 --> 00:11:46,55
And i still have they're our me that you never used to have the same room in rival the same room

105
00:11:46,55 --> 00:11:52,29
and by have this title then i still think it's back so i don't know how that i and then this made my life.

106
00:11:52,29 --> 00:12:02,52
In that i have the right that i have been she rather than a very international trip. Going about it right.

107
00:12:02,52 --> 00:12:08,87
But he let it run for me because i didn't remember it and i don't i didn't remember anything about it.

108
00:12:10,01 --> 00:12:20,38
Found in these on the rack. It would bring him. And all that and i'm one of the things that used to run that along.

109
00:12:20,38 --> 00:12:30,61
That he had done right through you. During a war you know actually during the war you're right in that sixty six.

110
00:12:30,61 --> 00:12:34,42
You are right. My dad he was and you know.

111
00:12:34,42 --> 00:12:42,72
The magnet for him and i don't know any of that or you know and i didn't write that

112
00:12:42,72 --> 00:12:52,58
and i think you know with that changed him and. I couldn't. You know and i adore and a lot of me. I mean my maker.

113
00:12:52,58 --> 00:13:00,53
And i have every nationality has their own talent you know it's really hard thing to do is right.

114
00:13:00,53 --> 00:13:05,37
And by that time i think we have chinese and were really were then

115
00:13:05,37 --> 00:13:11,8
and your words have a certain sympathy for the past when you look at it from the time that right.

116
00:13:11,8 --> 00:13:16,62
When that was what sort of that's really kind of nice to think that it is beautiful.

117
00:13:16,62 --> 00:13:19,64
That if you have a good change to me and. That it is.

118
00:13:19,64 --> 00:13:25,84
You know what you think that i like when you see it it's families to that but not on it

119
00:13:25,84 --> 00:13:28,73
but if you understand that you know and not.

120
00:13:29,42 --> 00:13:36,6
Yes and i think enough that need to get back i think you know you have nothing else. The same guy like many guys.

121
00:13:36,6 --> 00:13:48,13
You know. If you read any case at hand right now i think that in the early going to get him to me in the attack.

122
00:13:48,13 --> 00:13:51,36
It was me attack him and kill the children.

123
00:13:51,36 --> 00:13:58,97
And then when you're running around making nice rather than it was freaking me. Mr mann.

124
00:13:58,97 --> 00:14:07,54
That arranging the englishman i suspect to tap into the mainstream meaning that seven years went by i bashfully think

125
00:14:07,54 --> 00:14:13,65
very little that i missed that. I have to know they can thank you if i have to tell you i can.

126
00:14:13,65 --> 00:14:17,6
If i have to my real name is. But i can understand it all. Yeah.

127
00:14:17,6 --> 00:14:18,8
I'm going to remember me here here

128
00:14:18,8 --> 00:14:24,13
and have told him to run a sign in english you know trying to explain something to him

129
00:14:24,13 --> 00:14:27,29
and he couldn't get the right read for not five.

130
00:14:27,29 --> 00:14:32,3
Driving a ten year plan wrong going to understand it but i think i mean you know.

131
00:14:36,34 --> 00:14:45,59
Yes after the ride me about your hands on that piece of my neck you know rick

132
00:14:45,59 --> 00:14:52,8
and i wanted to do they have any you know it's real when they have been a good few years and i went to school

133
00:14:52,8 --> 00:15:02,23
and we were having a horse. And that she used to ride to school and its host. Didn't like grand rapids.

134
00:15:02,23 --> 00:15:08,27
And when rather than look a man from me to me he thought i can write about her was in the running a little behind me

135
00:15:08,27 --> 00:15:10,48
and that we should look at about iraq.

136
00:15:10,48 --> 00:15:13,38
And he said i think i'd be getting you know that he said no

137
00:15:13,38 --> 00:15:18,62
but we're going to be winning i she was right up on the scene down about a how he got on a.

138
00:15:18,62 --> 00:15:23,85
Hyped up back but i'm not going to go back to manny when i mean that mcnabb.

139
00:15:23,85 --> 00:15:30,35
And yet have not been there anything that you were the only good little dried up. And we kind of bad.

140
00:15:30,35 --> 00:15:32,17
If you eat the banana doing.

141
00:15:32,17 --> 00:15:37,86
In any group that went on a position which we had met in the beginning we couldn't get anything out of that

142
00:15:37,86 --> 00:15:43,53
and we decided to try and buy some land of iran. But it was still very had to rain.

143
00:15:43,53 --> 00:15:52,00
And we built a time and with one hundred i got that trying to break between trying you can become a champion

144
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:59,99
and might have been that of my brother a little more to get that battle in a distant we didn't have to see if the half.

145
00:15:59,99 --> 00:16:00,6
Going to marry

146
00:16:00,6 --> 00:16:08,87
and i would have been that many so i would think about how about with a brain of their own he played like.

147
00:16:11,07 --> 00:16:11,6
And in the borough

148
00:16:11,6 --> 00:16:18,39
and what's wrong with that enjoying you know anything with anybody so i don't have any it had rained it all ran with it

149
00:16:18,39 --> 00:16:28,65
right i had the advantage to be able to happen. So many silent. That we knew that band and we sounded out.

150
00:16:28,65 --> 00:16:31,22
I mean you know a little house. And i think.

151
00:16:31,22 --> 00:16:37,17
Actually i think it got shifted once again and i mean right now about it or read anything you know.

152
00:16:37,17 --> 00:16:43,18
Me from about iraq for the for the little thing and main things i'm not.

153
00:16:43,18 --> 00:16:50,56
It's only available right by about half of what i need it with granted some of them. If you plan it.

154
00:16:50,56 --> 00:16:55,77
When we moved right. And we planted moment nonis being the true.

155
00:16:55,77 --> 00:17:02,86
We have to make the right green bananas runs i'm gonna have a good price. I'm gonna buy bread so we had good. Landlady.

156
00:17:02,86 --> 00:17:07,07
I think of the type of thirty i could between us.

157
00:17:07,07 --> 00:17:16,81
And that mean that we had to play and want to happen with a very rocky. And nat.

158
00:17:16,81 --> 00:17:21,64
On the fact that we had no events really banks but then my brother and i and my brother

159
00:17:21,64 --> 00:17:25,77
and brother in the immediate times i had high paid.

160
00:17:25,77 --> 00:17:33,27
And replanted of dying on this rocky mountain a lot of the time and of no not really good bananas.

161
00:17:33,27 --> 00:17:40,45
And i never said robbie that we have to migrate to plant them and i wanted to win the sack of kind not.

162
00:17:40,45 --> 00:17:43,7
And i'm just an ordinary cow about whether or not.

163
00:17:43,7 --> 00:17:49,69
I mean you know i had to use the actual i think i'm an engram heineman he found to be idling in the north

164
00:17:49,69 --> 00:17:55,58
and south thing i've got pains are in me out of them and you've got a guy. That's going to count.

165
00:17:55,58 --> 00:18:02,5
Axel right opinions of them are right. That seminary had a very rocky and.

166
00:18:02,5 --> 00:18:08,75
When we had to have a hole with a tag on it on a stand with a hose that's not what they were going to be to money so we

167
00:18:08,75 --> 00:18:08,87
brought.

168
00:18:09,12 --> 00:18:16,65
And it will kind of bring out a track that we can really get might not go over the cracks about the middle kind of

169
00:18:16,65 --> 00:18:21,55
thing that i need with many snow. And it will be my job to drive it.

170
00:18:21,55 --> 00:18:26,99
That the manana scene and all of that are right here believe you me and i am behaving.

171
00:18:26,99 --> 00:18:29,36
Would have made a big version of an advantage.

172
00:18:29,36 --> 00:18:35,37
He had grown around for in china under an armed dragon at the time we need a little fact.

173
00:18:35,37 --> 00:18:43,49
And a good arriving at a good. And i know. Rice name from the bottom and right of the take you know guy i remember.

174
00:18:43,49 --> 00:18:48,84
I don't know what we were doing about me pulling them out and hang around.

175
00:18:48,84 --> 00:18:53,11
And i was driving as usual and the sound of rain. Me.

176
00:18:53,11 --> 00:19:02,27
That tracks on the caterpillar track down pulled it down nappy headed on top of a never stand which triggered that sort

177
00:19:02,27 --> 00:19:11,82
of the track that i did was on the start of a hill. And i can just so the track been going. And i hit me right jam.

178
00:19:11,82 --> 00:19:19,82
And of course i john. The luck of the not happened just after you know. If i jumped down hill i jumped up and.

179
00:19:19,82 --> 00:19:24,1
Thankfully thank god would have to store a little. I don't reckon with a round on me.

180
00:19:24,1 --> 00:19:29,63
From the me forever with that of anything right you going out.

181
00:19:29,63 --> 00:19:36,06
Over many guys then we had to push it back pretty bad but you know i'm bad and i got it with many many.

182
00:19:36,06 --> 00:19:42,81
Write me a phony baloney. I mean let's face it when he thought jonathan are going down he went really well you know.

183
00:19:42,81 --> 00:19:48,17
You could do that but any right not bring it on and we could go on a plane and i thought out.

184
00:19:48,17 --> 00:19:49,85
I mean even met not because i'm going to go.

185
00:19:49,85 --> 00:19:51,36
Ok but in the right and it got me down

186
00:19:51,36 --> 00:20:00,77
and then after a round we decided we'd try to mend that going to davy found out and gave me.

187
00:20:00,77 --> 00:20:03,13
The maker of the monotonous. Little stool.

188
00:20:03,13 --> 00:20:06,33
To throw in with the room with me i mean it with me in it and

189
00:20:06,33 --> 00:20:11,14
when he comes try to write down into the night of the tank. Come to writing month.

190
00:20:11,14 --> 00:20:17,47
Just back from when you're playing them it's uniting not that that's not just never going to be visible.

191
00:20:17,47 --> 00:20:22,16
So remember the band and babies in between the. You know. We've done a rap.

192
00:20:22,16 --> 00:20:30,66
That regularly will be that the build up to hit any right. And remove the bat signal right jean. And then.

193
00:20:30,66 --> 00:20:34,62
Know that that time was to with my brother in law.

194
00:20:34,62 --> 00:20:38,21
And my brother in law ronald i mean we're all of them ripping down my hand.

195
00:20:38,21 --> 00:20:45,02
That we had there been a machine that you know yes we had the european machine i mean it had written the making of the

196
00:20:45,02 --> 00:20:45,56
united kingdom.

197
00:20:45,56 --> 00:20:53,5
Some time in the morning which is dying are going to think you know we know we've got to admit i don't think we're

198
00:20:53,5 --> 00:21:00,57
going to die very much where you know he died not. Then of course and when the cistern on i did the milking then.

199
00:21:00,57 --> 00:21:06,59
Not in the morning and i went to found it in between which to rip them out. We had to chant.

200
00:21:06,59 --> 00:21:08,41
I'm going to have that good at the height

201
00:21:08,41 --> 00:21:18,56
when she photographed me that checking the grass around the room with this bright organized guy how to read have to

202
00:21:18,56 --> 00:21:19,46
read with a had a chip

203
00:21:19,46 --> 00:21:26,37
or a woman out in between the monotonous with the highway which you were going mad mad world at the wrong thing to do

204
00:21:26,37 --> 00:21:29,57
and i wouldn't have surprise much in the beginning.

205
00:21:29,57 --> 00:21:34,51
Because when you move the top for the next run it will get right to right.

206
00:21:34,51 --> 00:21:38,88
Whereas you can just ride the story would be in the newsroom.

207
00:21:38,88 --> 00:21:43,02
Found out of the top three little one of the last rites of mission on the hill.

208
00:21:43,02 --> 00:21:52,09
But of course you would in that time low ranking thing that we did in the king. And i remember one morning.

209
00:21:52,09 --> 00:21:59,65
In a very odd looking machines had been hiding out and. It runs batted down. The section.

210
00:21:59,65 --> 00:22:04,79
Wooden the right side of the baby actually wish ange would put it off if you put them on the cans.

211
00:22:04,79 --> 00:22:08,87
And every one of the five hundred children about that had to be putting.

212
00:22:10,98 --> 00:22:17,51
And that was kind of happen and i thought i think that it might have been which the machines are.

213
00:22:17,51 --> 00:22:19,04
And then when i said right.

214
00:22:19,04 --> 00:22:28,45
He tricked it on the guy that you know never made it but i had to really go at it when it turned up in the rain.

215
00:22:28,45 --> 00:22:32,13
I was going to write i was drawn and i just stopped the rail.

216
00:22:32,13 --> 00:22:36,35
From spinning out of what it would have been just trying my hand at me

217
00:22:36,35 --> 00:22:43,18
and i have chatted up things that got me to say he made the china doll. Just automatically.

218
00:22:43,18 --> 00:22:46,97
Samurai brad and i had back.

219
00:22:46,97 --> 00:22:52,55
You know you break your arm you know it's a rag and yeah about me i'm not in any bad run by anyone and.

220
00:22:52,55 --> 00:22:59,91
On the side but i have to have a lot of growth that many difficulties

221
00:22:59,91 --> 00:23:09,52
and i need to be good at the same time i have them. Up and stop and go back i need back and i my brother.

222
00:23:09,52 --> 00:23:11,91
Here with all of the time got shingle that.

223
00:23:11,91 --> 00:23:16,17
He couldn't read them and i've been in the opening round hand me

224
00:23:16,17 --> 00:23:23,5
when i asked not to run around many many children i was crowded with the middle of the one hand. You know.

225
00:23:23,5 --> 00:23:28,46
And my sister in law and i carried on there were no children at that night

226
00:23:28,46 --> 00:23:31,85
but yes i know you know if i had to endure the mistral didn't.

227
00:23:31,85 --> 00:23:37,45
That i had to have you know it was brought to think that this guy had to have bad.

228
00:23:37,45 --> 00:23:41,42
And i think a lot of the children would rather than that door would you go again

229
00:23:41,42 --> 00:23:47,56
and i will let you know that they haven't done it with me and run. The night that you know.

230
00:23:47,56 --> 00:23:55,15
I mean the children all together and. I don't have to tell me i don't rule out of the you know i said.

231
00:23:55,15 --> 00:24:00,29
But i think i could have come up around ten out of they were going to have a problem

232
00:24:00,29 --> 00:24:08,87
and i was a little behind the hard times when right. Is that right i had time for that frederick to do.

233
00:24:09,1 --> 00:24:13,15
And i mean if you didn't believe in you couldn't balance i will think of this like you did

234
00:24:13,15 --> 00:24:21,33
and i just pounded on a lot of the right. Of that both of the children that.

235
00:24:21,33 --> 00:24:27,62
I never started it and i had to go right at the end.

236
00:24:27,62 --> 00:24:30,97
And then she ran off to jail and you got tended not to

237
00:24:30,97 --> 00:24:36,52
and you've got to try to create an environment to train your thanks to you and then on high school.

238
00:24:36,52 --> 00:24:43,31
And let's not get me wrong and it's me i thought about it and you know. Richmond you know may not be any high school.

239
00:24:43,31 --> 00:24:51,03
Around in iraq and i don't mean you know about going to bed but i've got a. Well i think it was called the lady.

240
00:24:51,03 --> 00:24:56,66
And with run it was called the high school certificate. In the correct me. Yes but that about that.

241
00:24:56,66 --> 00:25:04,75
How many years between seventy and seventy. Not to because i think i have interviewed a couple of them to train me.

242
00:25:04,75 --> 00:25:07,5
You know that at night.

243
00:25:07,5 --> 00:25:13,37
Writing running on any of the leisure a little monetary gains you know she was really really good woman.

244
00:25:13,37 --> 00:25:21,96
Which helped me a lot and read that anything that means you know got the name down there from the united.

245
00:25:21,96 --> 00:25:26,78
Schoolteacher the gist of it. Trying ukraine. To manage him.

246
00:25:26,78 --> 00:25:34,4
And run it right i'm talking about ronnie is here with us now because the thing is you know it's good when he went.

247
00:25:34,4 --> 00:25:38,81
Sydney before you. And many were down there.

248
00:25:38,81 --> 00:25:43,01
He got mad when he was down there and i'm not working with danny my friend

249
00:25:43,01 --> 00:25:48,24
and we think of that picture right of not going to change.

250
00:25:48,24 --> 00:25:51,98
The bus he was working for a bookshop in town and said could they come back.

251
00:25:51,98 --> 00:25:55,24
They could come back and with me if i wanted to.

252
00:25:55,24 --> 00:26:00,36
World if i did not return to writing i'm not actually writing and writing or the kind that wouldn't normally anyway.

253
00:26:00,36 --> 00:26:08,87
There was no time for i think i'm back with sam i read. Sydney pretty good in the.

254
00:26:09,00 --> 00:26:16,93
We're not trying to kind of the strength of a run up as machine when you think you know that's what happened.

255
00:26:16,93 --> 00:26:21,55
And we kind of make kind that i don't like it when i think you know that one.

256
00:26:21,55 --> 00:26:25,94
And i think good now i'm going to handle that you know which is great i like having to handle it.

257
00:26:25,94 --> 00:26:32,06
How many grandchildren all together. All right. And i'm going to train three girls you know.

258
00:26:32,06 --> 00:26:41,38
And i'm going to have the ability. And ever and i think he's let me make a lot and you know. I have been told that.

259
00:26:41,38 --> 00:26:49,00
Yes i have been tainted and she is a trying not to be trying when we're sort of just going with going to think.

260
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:57,04
I think. I think it's a good idea that. It's a pretty big something. I'm not sure what i mean and i'm saying.

261
00:26:57,04 --> 00:27:04,82
I've met him and i think that that's going on and you know if you guys go away. You know and i think it was on days.

262
00:27:04,82 --> 00:27:08,96
I think maybe it would have made a big school. Would have been a big school in maine.

263
00:27:08,96 --> 00:27:14,81
It's a catholic school but rather than relieving the catholics going over thing i would think that the right. Pages.

264
00:27:14,81 --> 00:27:25,74
There were not the nice you know. He is not very many not a stand united i mean you know.

265
00:27:25,74 --> 00:27:38,37
Heavenly you know to write your great read it again you know i think the natural the way we witness started.

266
00:27:38,37 --> 00:27:45,7
To maybe in detail. When you were nineteen seventeen.

267
00:27:45,7 --> 00:27:50,28
Coming in i decided that i really didn't like family but never a lot calmer

268
00:27:50,28 --> 00:27:54,00
but much actually trying to get a job in town.

269
00:27:54,00 --> 00:28:02,13
Which i did i have regretted my own factory which was then any i think since then i'm going to see the apparel.

270
00:28:02,13 --> 00:28:08,87
Seventy i used to work on main street our the. I stayed there for about eight g. Which that's a lot.

271
00:28:09,29 --> 00:28:19,67
Maker of or even matter right used to run very much at risk your money coming in and without any new aftermath.

272
00:28:19,67 --> 00:28:25,4
Three months after we may need it if you had back. Really bad at around him.

273
00:28:25,4 --> 00:28:31,06
And he had to have an operation not to have a newsgroup man you and he were the right.

274
00:28:31,06 --> 00:28:38,68
For every union over here our lives with the bananas to read and a job at the factory. I didn't know anything.

275
00:28:38,68 --> 00:28:42,2
Give me back to you about the good meaning of the money.

276
00:28:42,2 --> 00:28:47,47
Car i would be working with monotonous and waking me up more than jade

277
00:28:47,47 --> 00:28:52,7
when you had brought in jade that were going to run down on from friday night

278
00:28:52,7 --> 00:28:59,41
and cut banana on the side down from the front and i mean i've made them here.

279
00:28:59,41 --> 00:29:03,34
To kill the cheese that when i would go right on the try.

280
00:29:03,34 --> 00:29:08,98
What i used to be ashamed to drive the bananas in with a jeep with a banana geyser on its own.

281
00:29:08,98 --> 00:29:15,6
Having a packet of fare i arrived with that great many in my lunch hour drive out of that type of bananas

282
00:29:15,6 --> 00:29:25,06
and i would then. And i'm tired i get back for a long time and eventually my brother a little below.

283
00:29:25,06 --> 00:29:29,78
The anonymous tip is run down or i remember i think you know the route.

284
00:29:29,78 --> 00:29:36,51
It was boring running and making it down enough to bring him over the twenty one of twenty two guys on the trial

285
00:29:36,51 --> 00:29:40,59
or behind a pro and i tracked down the girl. That it was it was too heavy.

286
00:29:40,59 --> 00:29:48,66
And i had that body kind of the head with drags on not that i didn't want to my concrete kind of run out of them over

287
00:29:48,66 --> 00:29:55,77
on and on down and down the hill. Track just looked at it a bit and one of the tracks went out.

288
00:29:55,77 --> 00:29:59,36
I used to go around it and i know none of me floored me again.

289
00:29:59,36 --> 00:30:03,42
With my barrel just got that word in full with until i went back again.

290
00:30:03,42 --> 00:30:08,87
But there i am i'm not going to be saving a little money kinds of them but none of them a crime.

291
00:30:09,01 --> 00:30:14,35
And i think i think i'm gonna tell me i'm not back but the fact that.

292
00:30:14,35 --> 00:30:17,62
I've made randy in five zero which is the new era.

293
00:30:17,62 --> 00:30:22,44
I'm in and i need to do it with a light behind the counter banana and i know that might not have come out

294
00:30:22,44 --> 00:30:24,32
and a lot of the young men from me

295
00:30:24,32 --> 00:30:33,35
and coming to town that's were not really were drawn into making any headway to having me. Operation out of the map.

296
00:30:33,35 --> 00:30:41,16
And i can remember i used to come in every night to me getting around that give me pain with clean records.

297
00:30:41,16 --> 00:30:47,25
I mean you're going to be offended i know. And i could have cried. With another five times.

298
00:30:47,25 --> 00:30:49,54
And i've never i've been you know what i had a problem with that

299
00:30:49,54 --> 00:30:53,43
and you know he's going to have he's telling me it's going very little.

300
00:30:53,43 --> 00:31:00,93
Around and around and i think i have traction on him to try moving back maybe a minute.

301
00:31:00,93 --> 00:31:05,91
And i just grew to a power i feel of a doctor that tom and i think will work and we did it

302
00:31:05,91 --> 00:31:08,65
when he sent me anything you can operation.

303
00:31:08,65 --> 00:31:14,94
That we have to have the right you know we're thrilled right back by were much better after that.

304

310
00:31:47,04 --> 00:31:57,26
And we had found a found when we came to means we'll get the founder of our own for a ban on the sixteen i think.

311
