1
00:00:15,9 --> 00:00:23,8
We come to nimbin for peace and happiness and how many in our lives and. The way that we divided the labor.

2
00:00:23,8 --> 00:00:33,12
In those early days of. Building our homes and establishing gotten was really directed towards peace and harmony and.

3
00:00:33,12 --> 00:00:37,41
The difficulties that would have ensued from doing it the other way around

4
00:00:37,41 --> 00:00:41,82
and having the women trying to build the house and the men inside going after the kids.

5
00:00:41,82 --> 00:00:46,97
That would not have been a harmonious situation. This didn't in any way.

6
00:00:46,97 --> 00:00:52,34
Of a lay the deep suspicion of the city feminists that we just full in for the old line and.

7
00:00:52,34 --> 00:00:59,8
You know that we were really not creating any sort of alternative atoll. But from up point of view.

8
00:00:59,8 --> 00:01:05,03
It was a more harmonious way of living a life so i think i can't speak for all my sisters in that regard

9
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:14,64
but certainly for me. It didn't feel too bad and i did have a go at clearing a site and starting to build something.

10
00:01:14,64 --> 00:01:22,26
And within a very short space of time. I was weeping over the magic. I do you know just feeling totally incompetent.

11
00:01:22,69 --> 00:01:31,03
Now there will women who who have built houses and. One woman built a stone house at the top of a cliff.

12
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:33,19
From stunning that she had to get up there somehow

13
00:01:33,19 --> 00:01:41,63
and she devised a flying fox to carry the materials up to the sunlight. An extraordinary feat of engineering.

14
00:01:42,3 --> 00:01:44,35
And another woman. Not any built.

15
00:01:44,67 --> 00:01:52,42
Oh i think by now she's built several houses but in the in the early time of paradise valley she built her first home.

16
00:01:52,42 --> 00:01:59,57
And subsequently went on to teach other women. In a women's building course and also taught aboriginal women.

17
00:01:59,57 --> 00:02:03,84
In a building course. So that's not to say that you know.

18
00:02:03,84 --> 00:02:07,41
There weren't women who became builders that would quite a few.

19
00:02:09,11 --> 00:02:15,42
But as i say in the early days it was it was mainly the men who did that sort of work and. Mostly the.

20
00:02:15,47 --> 00:02:22,92
That was that was ok. The ways in which of cool so you know i mean the guys that came to live a ton of would just gone.

21
00:02:22,92 --> 00:02:24,22
You know and the women were just women

22
00:02:24,22 --> 00:02:29,38
and we all came with the conditioning that we'd all had no different from the rest of society.

23
00:02:29,38 --> 00:02:38,15
But with to have a little more will to move past our conditioning. And establish new values and customs for us selves.

24
00:02:38,15 --> 00:02:45,71
So that the aim of that was ready to help each other rather than to confront each other constantly which would have

25
00:02:45,71 --> 00:02:55,29
just been a constant battle. I think we were aiming for. What how can we cooperate how can we live together better.

26
00:02:56,22 --> 00:03:03,8
And there were many ways in which we tried to achieve that and the women's group was particularly supportive of women.

27
00:03:03,8 --> 00:03:11,61
You know who either wanted. In their relationship. To improve their status as women.

28
00:03:11,61 --> 00:03:19,02
Or who felt that their status was so far from any hope of improvement in the relationship that they were in that they

29
00:03:19,02 --> 00:03:24,01
were supported then to get out of that relationship because it was seen as being destructive and harmful.

30
00:03:24,01 --> 00:03:31,12
And i guess for that reason at all for a lot of relationships actually didn't survive and.

31
00:03:31,12 --> 00:03:39,53
I do think was that was partly because women were supported to leave. Relationships that was stifling them.

32
00:03:40,96 --> 00:03:46,9
So if very much so. Although it was affected too.

33
00:03:46,9 --> 00:03:53,85
You'd think twice before leaving any sort of a shelter because there wasn't another one to go to easily and.

34
00:03:55,13 --> 00:04:00,95
But because i suppose there were very few women and quite a lot of guys. And probably about three to one.

35
00:04:00,95 --> 00:04:04,4
And in the first few years of tangible.

36
00:04:04,4 --> 00:04:08,56
It was a little easier for women to find support not only among the women friends

37
00:04:08,56 --> 00:04:15,42
but also from other guys outside of her relationship. And it didn't work the other way.

38
00:04:15,91 --> 00:04:25,95
And that led to an awful lot of loneliness. Particularly among the guys who were there. Without patents and and.

39
00:04:25,95 --> 00:04:29,81
Really belied the myth that. The nimbin.

40
00:04:29,81 --> 00:04:31,6
Alternative society was about six drugs

41
00:04:31,6 --> 00:04:35,6
and rock'n'roll because it was not as much about six as people might have supposed.

42
00:04:35,6 --> 00:04:42,21
The fact that we all ran around stark naked which we did. Had nothing to do with that.

43
00:04:42,21 --> 00:04:49,95
Well certainly as far as i was concerned it didn't it may have in the minds of some people but it really you know.

44
00:04:49,95 --> 00:04:58,47
In a way that was a kind of incest to boo. Operating with was so close to living together and such close quote is that.

45
00:04:58,47 --> 00:05:06,23
To run through a series of highly charged sexual relationships with one's. Brothers and sisters.

46
00:05:06,23 --> 00:05:11,51
Could have actually been destructive to the to the survival of the community and.

47
00:05:11,51 --> 00:05:16,58
You know i don't know how conscious that was but i observed that it didn't happen.

48
00:05:16,58 --> 00:05:20,65
That there weren't a series of highly charged six your relationships that.

49
00:05:20,65 --> 00:05:28,05
One relationship might be breaking down and another one. Might be passionately starting up. But it was.

50
00:05:28,05 --> 00:05:35,29
It wasn't rife through the community or. You know sort of a total sort of day night loving as.

51
00:05:35,29 --> 00:05:58,47
Is the media might have liked to put try it. Despite the fact that we never had any clothes on it very much so.

52
00:05:58,47 --> 00:06:04,95
And in fact i think. Had it not been for my. Tribal experience of nimbin.

53
00:06:04,95 --> 00:06:12,06
I may not have gone on to be as interested in other tribal cultures as i am but. Subsequently i spent a great deal of.

54
00:06:12,35 --> 00:06:21,04
Time with the rainforest tribes and sort of like in borneo. And particularly with the tribes and.

55
00:06:21,04 --> 00:06:29,75
There is ways of living. Exhibit often very much the same sort of qualities and i'm noticed also with some.

56
00:06:29,75 --> 00:06:35,61
Aboriginal tribal people and north american indians to the.

57
00:06:35,61 --> 00:06:42,24
Probably the most important things is if everybody has such a similar level of poverty. It's not really.

58
00:06:42,24 --> 00:06:50,64
Fessor was not really experience just pull for tea then it's. Anything that is. Extra to your very basic.

59
00:06:50,64 --> 00:06:58,05
Provisions is is a treat and everybody's really excited about that. But also. You'll share anything.

60
00:06:58,05 --> 00:07:01,89
If everyone's really pull you'll share anything with anyone.

61
00:07:01,89 --> 00:07:09,21
There's no that's mine and you can have it sort of feeling. And that's true throughout tribal societies and.

62
00:07:09,21 --> 00:07:15,6
It's more true in truly. Tribal societies and it wasn't name been in those days but there were elements of that.

63
00:07:15,6 --> 00:07:23,79
That that. You know. There was there would always be a welcome and refreshments and. You know.

64
00:07:23,79 --> 00:07:30,79
Hospitality even for total strangers who arrived it turned that some way they'd always find a warm welcome

65
00:07:30,79 --> 00:07:37,7
and a sense of community as soon as they cut that and. That's it that's a very tribal. Thing and.

66
00:07:37,7 --> 00:07:45,92
A kind of integrity and. A trust and. A lack of a strange a feeling.

67
00:07:45,92 --> 00:07:52,52
You know that you are a stranger and somebody else is a stranger there's a kind of. Dismal openness and trust.

68
00:07:52,52 --> 00:07:56,98
Accepting people exactly as you find them at that moment. And not.

69
00:07:57,05 --> 00:08:02,99
Sort of projecting a whole lot of fear of suspicion on to them. And that tended to be.

70
00:08:02,99 --> 00:08:10,91
You know the way that we operated it. And all that everyone was ok. And if they prove themselves to be otherwise well.

71
00:08:10,91 --> 00:08:19,89
We just knew more about them then. You know. And i think that's. That's a fairly tribal sort of thing and.

72
00:08:19,89 --> 00:08:28,41
Despite what i said earlier about their ways of bringing up children. Still within the tribal setting.

73
00:08:28,41 --> 00:08:35,15
There were more advantages for children than disadvantages to the tribal way of bringing up children in the sense that.

74
00:08:35,15 --> 00:08:40,63
Adults would have a sense of responsibility. As much for other people's children as for their own.

75
00:08:41,11 --> 00:08:46,77
Now that might have come back to a lowest common denominator that they didn't have much sense of responsibility for

76
00:08:46,77 --> 00:08:52,39
anyone's children but the children will survive i mean none of them actually sort of drowned in the creek.

77
00:08:52,39 --> 00:08:58,86
And so that there was a sense that there were other eyes and ears and uncles and aunties out there.

78
00:08:58,86 --> 00:09:05,03
And if you kids were in difficulty that they'd be somebody they could call on even if you weren't nearby.

79
00:09:05,03 --> 00:09:13,11
That was a good feeling and and a tribal feeling. But i think mostly that the sense of a tribal. Experience came.

80
00:09:13,11 --> 00:09:18,36
When we came together for celebrations and dances and. Events.

81
00:09:18,36 --> 00:09:26,27
Could have been an event centered around a spiritual activity such as a naming ceremony for children or.

82
00:09:26,27 --> 00:09:32,42
A retreat tool. Or something of that sort or it could have been just a full moon down so it blew no poll.

83
00:09:32,42 --> 00:09:39,16
It could have been anything but when we all came together. And sore each other there. In.

84
00:09:39,16 --> 00:09:42,53
You know dressed in whatever we addressed in silks and satins and colors

85
00:09:42,53 --> 00:09:48,73
and all that sort of stuff in celebrates removed. Then the tribal sense was exquisite.

86
00:09:48,73 --> 00:09:54,27
Just excludes it and it still it still survives now even though it was scattered through the hills

87
00:09:54,27 --> 00:09:59,44
and the rainbow region is extended far beyond. The boundaries of nimbin.

88
00:09:59,44 --> 00:10:06,61
When we do see each other at different events may be a bar and buy or even in sydney or somewhere else that. Sense of.

89
00:10:06,61 --> 00:10:12,99
Oh we together again. Is is really wonderful. And now it's interesting because we often.

90
00:10:13,18 --> 00:10:19,53
I find lots of different people we sort of make jokes about how we're all going to end up in the same old hippies home

91
00:10:19,53 --> 00:10:23,67
somewhere. And i mean that it's a joke now.

92
00:10:23,67 --> 00:10:28,82
Because we're in our mid forty's but actually twenty years down the track if we keep meeting like this you know.

93
00:10:28,82 --> 00:10:36,95
We know what's going to happen. And it could well be that. This is a wonderful eccentric old hippies.

94
00:10:36,95 --> 00:10:52,15
And there's a part of me that really hopes that will be. Well if i can i was one of the very earliest.

95
00:10:52,15 --> 00:10:58,02
Sort of institutions of naming i mean there were many and many have survived to the present day

96
00:10:58,02 --> 00:11:04,6
but the folk i was particularly special because there was so many people who came.

97
00:11:04,6 --> 00:11:13,74
Who had music as part of the background and. One of the things that they really love to do either as a as a you know.

98
00:11:13,74 --> 00:11:15,21
A player or a listener.

99
00:11:16,49 --> 00:11:21,98
And the folk cover rose out of that and a rose also out of the fact that a number of those people.

100
00:11:21,98 --> 00:11:23,91
They might have had classical training and.

101
00:11:23,91 --> 00:11:32,87
All sorts of training and education in music but a lot of them were into writing. Original material and.

102
00:11:32,87 --> 00:11:38,92
Which is not particularly commercial perhaps but. Incredibly enjoyable and.

103
00:11:38,92 --> 00:11:48,55
So we had a weekly event where you know it was just a kind of jam session or. You know people wouldn't. Would play.

104
00:11:48,55 --> 00:11:55,65
One at a time or into trios or whatever and then all get together at the end. For whatever happened and.

105
00:11:55,65 --> 00:12:03,23
It was it was an extra. Event. Every time it happened. I mean sometimes it was the most astonishing music.

106
00:12:03,23 --> 00:12:08,94
You know and people you got to be very famous we had people who sort of had played. The sydney opera house.

107
00:12:08,94 --> 00:12:11,24
You know playing.

108
00:12:11,24 --> 00:12:14,81
Believe a billy strange medieval instruments you know the night before

109
00:12:14,81 --> 00:12:19,65
and the next night found themselves in nimbin playing to a naming crowd and getting you know.

110
00:12:19,65 --> 00:12:25,32
And even a response in in the night go to the opera and.

111
00:12:25,32 --> 00:12:30,94
We did and we had a magic drawing of all sorts of people who came through and.

112
00:12:30,94 --> 00:12:38,01
One of the most healing events from them been in the early days when there was still quite a bit of suspicion

113
00:12:38,01 --> 00:12:44,72
and difficulty between the old cyclists and the new people who'd come to town and.

114
00:12:44,72 --> 00:12:48,88
Slim dusty was in town and was invited to to play at the folk.

115
00:12:48,88 --> 00:12:51,82
And and agreed to do that

116
00:12:51,82 --> 00:12:59,86
and it was just trying to test it because he was the hero of the country people who'd lived there forever and.

117
00:12:59,86 --> 00:13:05,7
You know particularly the sort of middle aged country women who lived at newman at that time you know just a team they

118
00:13:05,7 --> 00:13:14,42
were absolutely ecstatic slim dusty fans. Quite on a shame they'd let you know. Really amazing. And.

119
00:13:14,42 --> 00:13:22,17
And we organized a night where half of it was slim dusty and his daughter petrik and their band.

120
00:13:22,17 --> 00:13:27,12
And putting on a fantastic totally professional show for nothing. You know.

121
00:13:27,12 --> 00:13:33,79
And the rest of it was the name in folk club saying this in the best of up a full month and. Who organized.

122
00:13:33,79 --> 00:13:39,1
Some special material for the night to. To really share with the old cyclists.

123
00:13:39,1 --> 00:13:43,29
What it was that brings us together and keeps us together and to let them have a glimpse of that.

124
00:13:43,29 --> 00:13:48,42
And let them know that they will welcome and to share in it too any time and.

125
00:13:48,42 --> 00:13:53,02
It was just the most wonderfully successful night. Everyone had a great time.

126
00:13:53,02 --> 00:13:59,85
The close of coolest love slim dusty and what you felt so i wanted. Full to have him in their town. Going for them.

127
00:13:59,85 --> 00:14:03,29
But they also really enjoyed that little peek into.

128
00:14:03,29 --> 00:14:07,55
What the hippies like to do you know when they get in there on tuesday nights and have their folk club

129
00:14:07,55 --> 00:14:10,87
and you know they've never ventured in before.

130
00:14:10,87 --> 00:14:15,34
And that they had to tell the truth they didn't venture in much after either. But it was.

131
00:14:15,34 --> 00:14:23,28
They knew a bit more about his after that. And we had a a common shared high experience which.

132
00:14:23,28 --> 00:14:26,71
Amongst ourselves we were having all the time really regularly.

133
00:14:26,71 --> 00:14:33,97
But with the people who'd lived here before we came we seldom got to have that sort of commonality of a high experience

134
00:14:33,97 --> 00:14:37,98
that we could look back on together and say wilson had a great night and.

135
00:14:37,98 --> 00:14:56,48
It was lovely to have one of that as it was very special. I never had any yeah.

136
00:14:56,77 --> 00:15:05,95
I have personally never had any direct experience of hostility from. Psychos who'd been there before i came.

137
00:15:05,95 --> 00:15:11,45
But i heard of many people who did and i was it was the nearest i got was when somebody. I was at the.

138
00:15:11,45 --> 00:15:17,35
Bush factory one night and there was music on and. A neighbor complained very loudly about the noise and she obviously.

139
00:15:17,35 --> 00:15:21,56
Hated everything about his it wasn't just the noise. At the factory that night.

140
00:15:23,24 --> 00:15:27,56
Yes i did hear stories of people being shot at it when they were seen sort of.

141
00:15:27,56 --> 00:15:29,64
Diving into somebodies creek with no clothes on

142
00:15:29,64 --> 00:15:37,92
and there were you know i mean though it was a period of adjustment in the first five to eight years of of living there.

143
00:15:37,92 --> 00:15:40,54
Of you know understanding that.

144
00:15:40,54 --> 00:15:44,56
Maybe it was offensive to other people if we took our clothes off and jumped in the creek.

145
00:15:44,56 --> 00:15:50,45
You know and maybe we should think about that and and. I'm referring. Yeah.

146
00:15:50,45 --> 00:15:55,59
And at the same time you know it was offensive to us to see them lift a gun and shoot at anything.

147
00:15:55,59 --> 00:16:02,56
You know especially us. But you know you. Even a bird or a rabbit. A lot of people would have been very upset.

148
00:16:02,56 --> 00:16:03,59
So you know.

149
00:16:03,59 --> 00:16:07,15
I mean we just had lifestyle differences that were bound to bring some friction

150
00:16:07,15 --> 00:16:11,87
but given the number of those lifestyle differences and.

151
00:16:11,87 --> 00:16:18,12
The tenacity of people on both sides to their particular way of life in some cases.

152
00:16:18,12 --> 00:16:25,00
It's surprising that there wasn't more friction than there was and. I always feel like you know looking back on that.

153
00:16:25,00 --> 00:16:32,94
Applauding the old seculars for the. Example of tolerance. Which i think taught us a great deal and.

154
00:16:32,94 --> 00:16:35,38
When the time came for us to see.

155
00:16:35,38 --> 00:16:41,28
A third wave of secular is coming to name bin who had different ideals and looked different

156
00:16:41,28 --> 00:16:50,43
and acted differently from how we had. We were very hard put to it. To show as much tolerance and compassion.

157
00:16:50,43 --> 00:17:09,82
As the original seculars had been when we arrived on their doorstep. Oh yeah. The study was that.

158
00:17:09,82 --> 00:17:15,49
I did a study for the university of new england i think it was the geography department.

159
00:17:15,71 --> 00:17:17,92
It was a land use so they

160
00:17:17,92 --> 00:17:25,92
and the intention was to find out the shifting patterns of land use in various parts of new south wales i think they

161
00:17:25,92 --> 00:17:31,66
had a control area somewhere else. And they were particularly interested in.

162
00:17:31,66 --> 00:17:35,31
Interviewing the new settlers to nimbin and that and finding out what they were about

163
00:17:35,31 --> 00:17:40,11
and what their intentions were as forgot the. Regards the use of the land.

164
00:17:40,11 --> 00:17:44,24
Well i don't remember very much about what they replied in in answer to that particular question

165
00:17:44,24 --> 00:17:51,52
or that set of questions but what really struck me is quite remarkable. Was that.

166
00:17:51,52 --> 00:17:58,57
One of the questions that i os i had to interview i think it was ninety four hippies. Which was a. Had to do.

167
00:17:58,57 --> 00:18:02,9
It was actually a lot of fun. And one of the questions that i asked the mole.

168
00:18:02,9 --> 00:18:12,23
Was whether they felt themselves in coming to nimbin. To be a part of a movement. And i mean for.

169
00:18:12,23 --> 00:18:17,17
Objectively you know if you took a step back and looked at it. He would ninety four people representing another.

170
00:18:17,17 --> 00:18:23,87
You know several hundred who would all come around the same period of time to the same area.

171
00:18:23,87 --> 00:18:30,58
Doing more or less the same sorts of things in similar ways. And you know from an objective point of view.

172
00:18:30,58 --> 00:18:37,56
Would movement wouldn't be too strong a word to put on it but. A free one of them said that i'm not part of a movement.

173
00:18:37,56 --> 00:18:43,68
I'm an individual this like i was completely separate from anything else that was happening and.

174
00:18:43,68 --> 00:18:45,01
I found that quite astonishing

175
00:18:45,01 --> 00:18:52,11
but it was actually true i mean people believed that of themselves they felt they not only felt they really experienced

176
00:18:52,11 --> 00:18:58,14
themselves as making a totally individual choice. And coming to nimbin and doing a totally individual thing.

177
00:18:59,67 --> 00:19:05,00
And i love the duality of that. That. Of course it was a movement.

178
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:11,32
And of course it was nothing to do with a movement it was a. You know hundreds of totally individual decisions.

179
00:19:11,8 --> 00:19:14,28
I think that really appeared in my eyes is a lot about human

180
00:19:14,28 --> 00:19:20,3
and it says a lot about the difficulty that we always had in making rules for communities. You know.

181
00:19:20,3 --> 00:19:25,23
Tumble fulls coordination co-operative. I'd it's very first tribal meeting.

182
00:19:25,23 --> 00:19:30,99
Brought up the topic of whether people should be allowed to have cats dogs and guns. On the property.

183
00:19:31,39 --> 00:19:35,65
And now fifteen years later when most of the fifty eighteen. Nearly twenty years later.

184
00:19:36,59 --> 00:19:41,47
This still discussing whether they can have cats dogs and guns on the property. And now and it.

185
00:19:41,47 --> 00:19:46,21
All the end of inning is they have been cats and dogs and guns. And everybody's disapproved of it.

186
00:19:46,35 --> 00:19:54,69
And everybody's trying to make rules about it. And it can't happen. And. So we're there. Ah levels of agreement.

187
00:19:54,69 --> 00:20:03,65
I think that usually quite. Spoken. And unconscious and. Deviance from the general agreement.

188
00:20:03,65 --> 00:20:18,49
In terms of environmental custody and she have been. Those sorts of. Concepts and. Beyond rules. You know.

189
00:20:18,49 --> 00:20:25,49
No i don't because i feel that in a way it's success because. Rigid rules.

190
00:20:25,49 --> 00:20:33,62
Actively exclude the people who will not conform to them and. In a society of non conformists. The how.

191
00:20:33,62 --> 00:20:51,68
How could you possibly impose rigid rules. And not lose some of your best people to quit. It was about being active.

192
00:20:51,68 --> 00:21:08,73
Being creative. Being careful and being homeless and. It was also about growing. Selves. Food. Children.

193
00:21:08,73 --> 00:21:13,82
Institutions structures that we needed. That were appropriate to our needs.

194
00:21:13,82 --> 00:21:23,64
But growing all those things and taking care of those things and. As much as we could of the wider picture too.

195
00:21:23,64 --> 00:21:31,67
And giving something into it and putting into it somehow. Culturally.

196
00:21:31,67 --> 00:21:44,33
So that involve music and dance and poetry and all sorts of. And. I suppose treading lightly on the and and.

197
00:21:44,33 --> 00:21:49,29
And above all being homeless. That's what it was for me but you know.

198
00:21:49,29 --> 00:21:56,98
There be as many visions as there are people here.

199
00:22:00,97 --> 00:22:17,08
That he needs to go through all of this been simon a stupid hippie i did.

200
00:22:17,08 --> 00:22:26,2
And long he writes deep into the night of that technology and. It's really hard to even think of one example air.

201
00:22:26,2 --> 00:22:38,53
Said busy that. I kind i kind of come up with it and.

202
00:22:38,53 --> 00:22:45,29
Well i shammy it intends a conspiracy theory is that it that it it's been quite a frightening thing about name it in a

203
00:22:45,29 --> 00:22:50,11
way that that there's a lot of paranoia around and.

204
00:22:50,11 --> 00:22:56,09
I don't know that i really want to go into that they have because it's said to us by designing a few individuals.

205
00:22:56,09 --> 00:23:18,57
It's not a good. It's not a good starting point that the end. Going to that problem.

206
00:23:18,57 --> 00:23:26,44
Think that's why i really didn't want to go into it because there are some people around nimbin who would be thought

207
00:23:26,44 --> 00:23:31,9
disordered with or without marijuana who it actually. You know. Borderline personalities and.

208
00:23:31,9 --> 00:23:36,97
That's really harry's area of the mine. It's not a good. It's not a good thing for me to talk about.

209
00:23:36,97 --> 00:24:03,71
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Well people would. Yeah yeah. Well people your people gave their children.

210
00:24:03,71 --> 00:24:09,51
The names that people gave to their children were actually no funnier than the ones that they gave to themselves i mean

211
00:24:09,51 --> 00:24:17,03
you know there were as many sort of stuff and. Sunnies and. Moon shines in.

212
00:24:17,03 --> 00:24:24,89
Among the adult population who change their names as there were some strange and unusual names for the children and.

213
00:24:24,89 --> 00:24:30,15
Of course particularly when quite a few people became divots he's of russian age.

214
00:24:30,15 --> 00:24:35,67
And that's not to say that that was any kind of dominant paradigm in the community but quite a few people did.

215
00:24:35,67 --> 00:24:42,74
Get into the russian a she thing and take on new names as a result of that it was impossible to remember and.

216
00:24:42,74 --> 00:24:46,77
Too long and irrelevant. But that's a judgment of mine.

217
00:24:47,1 --> 00:24:54,54
But the nice that was given to children of course a lot of the children. Wouldn't wouldn't keep. Days they.

218
00:24:54,54 --> 00:25:00,68
Once they got to school age if the name embarrassed. Them the child would change it. I was it was a.

219
00:25:00,68 --> 00:25:11,17
It was chuckle tyga. Who pretty quickly was that had to sally when she got to school and. There was another little guy.

220
00:25:11,17 --> 00:25:18,27
I forget what his original name was but i remember he ended up being. He was known as d.d. His name is d.d.

221
00:25:18,27 --> 00:25:32,22
and That was his name. And he became john. Very quickly. And i remember one frenchman who didn't name his child a tool.

222
00:25:32,22 --> 00:25:34,09
And wouldn't give her name and.

223
00:25:34,09 --> 00:25:37,9
She was three when i measure and so didn't have a name but i don't know what became of her

224
00:25:37,9 --> 00:25:58,6
and close like can't remember her name. I think for me the most memorable night. Was was. Well the with several.

225
00:25:58,6 --> 00:26:04,42
There was several memorable nights but there was one in particular that was a new year's eve.

226
00:26:04,42 --> 00:26:11,45
Which traditionally was held. As a sort of costume bowl. A little pool and.

227
00:26:11,45 --> 00:26:16,67
A hippie costume ball is something to be seen. It was really fantastic.

228
00:26:16,67 --> 00:26:24,8
And on this particular night it was especially wonderful for me because i knew in advance that.

229
00:26:24,8 --> 00:26:29,08
Some people are coming over from america. Whom. I greatly admire.

230
00:26:29,08 --> 00:26:35,22
Stephen gaskin and his wife and i guess can who'd set up a community in tennessee called the.

231
00:26:36,29 --> 00:26:40,47
I'm with him i'd been in correspondence for several years by then.

232
00:26:40,47 --> 00:26:46,1
And they were coming to the area to visit i knew they would do you any day. But what actually happened was that.

233
00:26:46,1 --> 00:26:54,38
We were all at the done so. You know pull on new year's eve. And stephen gaskin and i know my. Arrived just as.

234
00:26:54,38 --> 00:26:59,41
Smiling ruth and. And the band. The band was cool blue skies or something.

235
00:26:59,41 --> 00:27:07,02
And they just started to play the tennessee waltz and by shia coincidence stephen and on and i arrived at bruno pole.

236
00:27:07,02 --> 00:27:11,39
And you know i recognized steven from a distance i was outside the whole one here.

237
00:27:11,39 --> 00:27:19,13
And i was standing facing him in the moment when he first heard the music and realized what the song was.

238
00:27:19,13 --> 00:27:25,26
And he realized that the tennessee waltz was being played. And i realized that he was steven gaskin from tennessee.

239
00:27:25,26 --> 00:27:31,37
And then we looked at each other and we just. Had this incredible hug. But we never met before.

240
00:27:31,37 --> 00:27:37,73
But it was incredibly high it was a wonderful experience. And he went on to spend a few weeks around nimbin.

241
00:27:37,73 --> 00:27:56,54
And it was a great visit and. A great cultural exchange. Oh i think there are certain parts of the world.

242
00:27:56,54 --> 00:28:01,33
That have a magic energy. I don't i couldn't define it any better than that.

243
00:28:01,33 --> 00:28:11,25
It's an energy that you feel as you approach a place. It might. Magnetize you it could repel you i suppose.

244
00:28:11,25 --> 00:28:20,75
But it's a feeling that you get about right. And name in it has a very strong spiritual place and.

245
00:28:20,75 --> 00:28:27,06
I couldn't possibly define it but for me it's absolutely a mistake of believe

246
00:28:27,06 --> 00:28:34,09
and i know that there are other people who experience other parts of the world as having a similar.

247
00:28:34,09 --> 00:28:36,1
Vibration if you like and i think it's a.

248
00:28:36,1 --> 00:28:41,43
You know it's to do with the things that have happened there the history of the place.

249
00:28:42,42 --> 00:28:48,61
I don't think those sorts of emanations. Disperse. Very easily and.

250
00:28:48,61 --> 00:28:52,97
You know there's a sort of cold dying canarsie feeling about.

251
00:28:52,97 --> 00:28:55,36
Places where cold dank and nasty things have happened

252
00:28:55,36 --> 00:29:00,83
and there's a an energetic feeling about places where energetic things have happened and.

253
00:29:00,83 --> 00:29:07,94
Nimbin is certainly one of things and i've got to get it.
