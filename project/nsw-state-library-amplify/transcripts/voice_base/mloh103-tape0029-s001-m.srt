1
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:29,5
I pod to know that you know where it was. Ascii. I ask a wife and i up.

2
00:00:29,5 --> 00:00:53,69
And i go on and gram ascii i came from newcastle. Where i was a marine engineer..

3
00:00:45,87 --> 00:00:53,39
And the reason i ended up on the north coast. Was i got busted for smoking. And sacked from the u.k.

4
00:00:56,88 --> 00:00:58,88
And i spent a little bit of time in sydney.

5
00:00:58,88 --> 00:01:03,53
After that which i hated and a friend of mine dropped around one night

6
00:01:03,53 --> 00:01:10,64
and said he just bought a health food restaurant in bangalore and bangle out.

7
00:01:10,64 --> 00:01:16,26
They know the town the back of my mind for years because we travelled up here on holiday shopping.

8
00:01:16,26 --> 00:01:25,45
And i remember a bangle i was just thinking of the little town which is still east. And i wasn't doing anything else.

9
00:01:25,45 --> 00:01:32,45
And so i came up and worked in his restaurant at the time. Was probably the only high strung to the north coast.

10
00:01:32,45 --> 00:01:38,48
It was wind farm and i worked there for about three months.

11
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:46,55
That was because my friend was why doing a different job was filling in for him.

12
00:01:46,55 --> 00:01:53,69
And then i just heard of a found a house to rent and a playschool bearing about which is the cost of my one on the.

13
00:01:53,69 --> 00:02:02,12
Four dollars a week. And so i went and lived day. And i found on forward into paradise.

14
00:02:04,73 --> 00:02:13,47
There was one other household of people from sydney. Which was the paddington said i referred to before and.

15
00:02:14,92 --> 00:02:30,58
And wonderfully welcome. Welcoming. I'm rural people who offers jobs. Just free food etc.

16
00:02:30,58 --> 00:02:34,86
And at the time that was the time of the holidays catalog everyone had a holiday. Catalog.

17
00:02:34,86 --> 00:02:43,51
And we all thought we were getting away from the big city lot more simple life. Really existence.

18
00:02:43,51 --> 00:02:52,55
Which was totally true. And sisters in this house lead bucolic existence.

19
00:02:52,55 --> 00:02:59,67
Until the dread of the prairie especially my feeling is that the tide was.

20
00:02:59,67 --> 00:03:12,89
We shouldn't tell anyone else and keep it very quiet. Because i could see that. The a.z.

21
00:03:12,89 --> 00:03:19,29
Life we were having would be sort of moral is taken away. Became more popular.

22
00:03:19,29 --> 00:03:34,59
And that's turned out something like that i guess. It's been good to know how i fit in with you claire and paypal.

23
00:03:34,59 --> 00:03:37,82
And the sort of people i like to mix with but.

24
00:03:37,82 --> 00:03:45,48
I don't think i can get a more straightforward and scientific way of looking at things.

25
00:03:45,48 --> 00:04:01,57
I guess that's because my engineering background. But it's all been good fun. At the time it was now.

26
00:04:01,57 --> 00:04:13,47
Judy out there now. And i left melbourne and nine hundred seventy two. Early nine hundred seventy two with my partner.

27
00:04:13,6 --> 00:04:23,36
The time. And my daughter portia. And we decided to go on the road. We sold everything and given away.

28
00:04:23,36 --> 00:04:29,44
All the positions. We've acquired attained a four wheel drive and.

29
00:04:29,44 --> 00:04:37,89
We'd taken about nine months to get from victoria up to the camp to along the way in the mary. River.

30
00:04:37,89 --> 00:04:45,27
For several months and. Explored and we were on our way around australia. We had friends.

31
00:04:45,27 --> 00:04:50,3
Up on the north coast so we decided to call in and say.

32
00:04:50,3 --> 00:04:55,43
One of them happened to be leaving environment where graham was leaving.

33
00:04:56,44 --> 00:05:02,13
The day we driving to mullumbimby was a wonderful day. We drive up into cooper's lane.

34
00:05:02,13 --> 00:05:05,98
And the local alternative people were having.

35
00:05:05,98 --> 00:05:11,32
What we used to have in those days which was about we'd gather together and we'd swap whatever.

36
00:05:11,32 --> 00:05:16,99
We had which ranged from sort of bush knots. Of wild q combos to.

37
00:05:16,99 --> 00:05:22,9
Food or bread that somebody had by your fruit and vegetables of people who peaked.

38
00:05:22,9 --> 00:05:28,49
Close that that bought back from india so you could go shopping at the shop.

39
00:05:28,49 --> 00:05:35,56
With you should parties and all and come home with clothes and fruit and vegetables and. Various things.

40
00:05:35,56 --> 00:05:42,5
And that was a very welcoming. Group of people. And i showed us where we could put up at st.

41
00:05:42,5 --> 00:05:47,45
I asked somebody how difficult it was to find a house. She said well.

42
00:05:47,45 --> 00:05:54,16
It's actually quite difficult you usually have to wait a couple of weeks. Which delighted me and i ended up.

43
00:05:54,16 --> 00:06:02,78
We ended up having a lovely found house there for several months. During that time. People started talking about this.

44
00:06:02,78 --> 00:06:09,69
Gathering that was going to happen and even them. None of us knew when human was it was some way over the mountain.

45
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:13,47
So one by one we drift.

46
00:06:16,15 --> 00:06:22,32
Most of us knew somebody who was already at an event and then these people had come back over to the coast

47
00:06:22,32 --> 00:06:27,87
and sigh all well it's quite exciting what's happening ivor and human and so on side as they are and they doing this

48
00:06:27,87 --> 00:06:35,47
and that. So we decided sort of collectively that we would go over and join their space to fold.

49
00:06:36,29 --> 00:06:39,9
We gather together a try and.

50
00:06:39,9 --> 00:06:46,23
We were fairly anxious about this festival and we weren't sure how many people were going to descend upon this place.

51
00:06:46,93 --> 00:06:51,66
So we decided to. Range our own little piece of land.

52
00:06:51,66 --> 00:07:01,23
Attached to the main faced a full sized became known as the magic circle and. So we also be able to have a little.

53
00:07:02,56 --> 00:07:09,3
Dwellings. My. Taint was actually the most where the proof. And at one stage of writing.

54
00:07:09,3 --> 00:07:23,08
Just before the festival and i had thirty people in my tent. That put a sort of papal mags. Largely more.

55
00:07:23,08 --> 00:07:33,27
And weatherproof dwellings out of plastic bits and pieces and bamboo and. Various things and.

56
00:07:33,27 --> 00:07:43,14
A few people had taped piece. As the original magic circle and have been settled in all asked to tour.

57
00:07:43,14 --> 00:07:49,41
We'd also set up our own food line way we hired a truck and decided that if.

58
00:07:49,41 --> 00:07:52,11
I mean you can pay for say and if we can still get out

59
00:07:52,11 --> 00:07:56,87
and get up to the brisbane markets to bring back the fresh fruit and vegetables.

60
00:07:58,04 --> 00:08:04,9
This didn't really need to happen because in fact it was very well organized and.

61
00:08:04,9 --> 00:08:08,39
The amount of people little rock same to be the right amount.

62
00:08:08,39 --> 00:08:13,47
It was a very exciting town being named for a few weeks before the face.

63
00:08:13,73 --> 00:08:20,62
Divil just as a few more people drifted in and the constant change that started to happen.

64
00:08:20,62 --> 00:08:27,63
We started off as a couple of hundred people and. As the faced of all got closer you could.

65
00:08:27,63 --> 00:08:36,13
The excitement of the hour now and what was going to happen. Thousands of people going to just saying.

66
00:08:36,13 --> 00:08:38,93
Tains of thousands old mili hundreds.

67
00:08:38,93 --> 00:08:47,46
And that are now an element was very exciting and we had always contingency plans.

68
00:08:47,46 --> 00:08:55,23
And as the face of all just grew it was quite organic and very exciting to just walk around the face to full size

69
00:08:55,23 --> 00:09:02,42
and there was music and a lot of healing and. Various frames of frames turning up and.

70
00:09:02,42 --> 00:09:09,41
Discovering that you were connected and you will lays out the people who will say and you will always other people.

71
00:09:09,41 --> 00:09:17,95
And one of the exciting parts was when the. Feeble foundry bus arrived from melbourne with a cluster of.

72
00:09:17,95 --> 00:09:25,38
Forty or fifty people on board with children and. Musical instruments and beautiful songs.

73
00:09:25,38 --> 00:09:34,52
And also a wonderful skill and knowledge of. Banking hall some. Braid and cakes and so forth.

74
00:09:34,52 --> 00:09:51,86
That took over the local bakery and supplied. The whole fish the whole thing with wonderful goodies. One memory on.

75
00:09:51,86 --> 00:09:56,04
And it's very clear to me. During the festival was.

76
00:09:56,04 --> 00:10:04,71
I was walking down the road from the magic circle towards the area and. And there was doug anthony with his wife.

77
00:10:04,71 --> 00:10:17,56
And doug the leader of the country. And he was dressed in casual country. Do you know. Long socks and shorts.

78
00:10:17,56 --> 00:10:25,4
That he was looking quite relaxed and didn't have any models with it. And i and i both and.

79
00:10:25,4 --> 00:10:31,76
That's just just another example of how tolerant the local people are of dog.

80
00:10:31,76 --> 00:10:43,68
Yeah yeah yeahs one of my memories was just before the festival began and was walking down the road and.

81
00:10:43,68 --> 00:10:54,03
I made two brothers mainly in the seventy's or eighty's it being born in name and and.

82
00:10:54,03 --> 00:11:00,15
Seen for a cup of tea and bread in about an hour and so we walked to dean.

83
00:11:00,15 --> 00:11:04,71
And we probably had very little clouds and i can't remember i think we put her so wrong on

84
00:11:04,71 --> 00:11:08,78
when we actually went out of the magic circle and.

85
00:11:08,78 --> 00:11:13,33
I remember sitting on a veranda looking down on to the faced oval sosh

86
00:11:13,33 --> 00:11:22,15
and talking to these maine about the feelings of. What was happening in a little country town. That was.

87
00:11:22,15 --> 00:11:26,66
That would allow i sure didn't thrill to them. It was lost. They were young paypal.

88
00:11:26,66 --> 00:11:33,91
And their home was being discovered and nurtured and they were very positive about it

89
00:11:33,91 --> 00:11:38,73
but i thought it was a really good thing that was happening. I assume those men and.

90
00:11:38,73 --> 00:11:41,88
Longer alive it's twenty years later but.

91
00:11:41,88 --> 00:11:47,65
It was really lovely to make that connection with paypal who'd been born and sing

92
00:11:47,65 --> 00:11:58,37
and go from quite a lucrative community. To a guying. Town. After the money had gone out of the day every industry.

93
00:11:58,37 --> 00:12:13,47
And i would delight at the young people were discovering their area around to they made it represented law.

94
00:12:15,1 --> 00:12:20,37
We didn't stop and because we weren't living in him and we were living and dying but.

95
00:12:20,37 --> 00:12:33,17
We went back to boring after about three four years of living on. Almost nine money whatsoever.

96
00:12:33,17 --> 00:12:44,35
I decided that i should just get a job and. I worked on. First of all.

97
00:12:44,35 --> 00:12:47,32
On the queensland state government shipped to our stride.

98
00:12:47,32 --> 00:13:10,01
And then later on on the prawn trolls in the gulf of carpentaria and. And that. Moralists ended my connection with the..

99
00:12:59,46 --> 00:13:09,64
Back to the movement. And i had nuff money out of that and. I'm continuing relationship with j.t.

100
00:13:10,01 --> 00:13:15,74
And i are expecting it and. We went totally against the trend again.

101
00:13:15,74 --> 00:13:24,77
On board a hass in dread of delusional and or aspirins living in the hills. Thought we were pricey.

102
00:13:25,06 --> 00:13:31,98
However since then many friends have also been forced to get jobs. And i've also ended up.

103
00:13:31,98 --> 00:13:45,51
Behind houses you know is more. After the faced of all we went back to mullumbimby. But we're still in my jeep.

104
00:13:45,51 --> 00:14:00,03
So we packed at once again and headed for north queensland where we spent six months. That was seventy four. Floods.

105
00:14:00,03 --> 00:14:03,91
And it was very wild up in north queensland you know taint.

106
00:14:03,91 --> 00:14:07,94
So we came back down to bearing with us so i ploughed in one day in front of us

107
00:14:07,94 --> 00:14:13,47
and i saw a clown one day behind us being stopped every. Hundred kilometers boss floods across the road.

108
00:14:13,62 --> 00:14:23,9
It was a very exciting time. Because you kept on making up with the same paper at the same slot and.

109
00:14:23,9 --> 00:14:31,32
I came back to the bering valley and a friend of mine had just moved out of her house and gave her to maine.

110
00:14:31,32 --> 00:14:36,94
We lived there for two years. My daughter went to school and.

111
00:14:36,94 --> 00:14:47,34
I got a little bit of work picking tomatoes for a lot of course and. I by that time had saved enough money.

112
00:14:47,34 --> 00:14:58,16
Through the work. To go to india. Discover debating borders and by that time. I was invited to a monastery. In a poll.

113
00:14:58,16 --> 00:15:09,51
So i took my daughter who was twelve. By that time. To india and we lived in europe for two and a half years.

114
00:15:09,51 --> 00:15:18,44
A bit like graham going to why i brought my connection with the back to the movement.

115
00:15:18,44 --> 00:15:26,23
And while a sword is still a lovely ideal and a lovely way to leave.

116
00:15:26,23 --> 00:15:32,22
Circumstances have changed and travel had changed me. So i came back and.

117
00:15:32,22 --> 00:15:40,45
Worked on the prone troll of with graham for a little while and. That's when we really got together and.

118
00:15:40,45 --> 00:15:56,94
And had a child and lived in lee's mall last year and. Well from maine.

119
00:15:56,94 --> 00:16:09,29
Is very much a place that i couldn't believe in. My have many friends who lives out there. The. The aboriginal stories.

120
00:16:09,29 --> 00:16:15,23
Of a thing as ceremonial place. And not a place. A space. For women to leave.

121
00:16:15,23 --> 00:16:21,14
Is very true and real for me i find it very difficult just to even drive to name and.

122
00:16:21,14 --> 00:16:25,96
Much easier to drive over to the coast. But i have.

123
00:16:25,96 --> 00:16:34,05
I love being close to me and from a sociological point of view it is a wonderful experiment and.

124
00:16:34,05 --> 00:16:42,11
It has really worked on many levels. The levels that it's work gone and not seeing by many people who visit the town.

125
00:16:43,06 --> 00:16:49,89
People tend to focus on the negative aspects of this very small town with no back straights.

126
00:16:49,89 --> 00:16:58,39
So everything happens on the main straight. People assume that's all there is to name and that in fact.

127
00:16:58,39 --> 00:17:08,44
The way that various communities have grown and handle their own problems and become self-sufficient and the way.

128
00:17:08,44 --> 00:17:14,01
That the children are looked after and cade for and the feeling of community.

129
00:17:14,14 --> 00:17:22,73
I think is quite extraordinary and goes faily which may be a good thing maybe that's why it works.

130
00:17:22,73 --> 00:17:32,17
That people are left out in the heels to actually leave out the dream sort out their problems.

131
00:17:32,17 --> 00:17:41,04
They're not a drain on the local economy at all in fact. Die in hansard. And i think in future years.

132
00:17:41,04 --> 00:17:47,41
The communities and even then will be used as a model for many other places.

133
00:17:47,41 --> 00:17:52,78
It's been quite difficult and the level of commitment. Of people.

134
00:17:52,78 --> 00:18:01,39
To leave out their ideals and they drain this is quite extraordinary.

135
00:18:01,39 --> 00:18:09,23
And i can't think of anywhere else in a strange way people have actually achieved as much as some of the communities

136
00:18:09,23 --> 00:18:26,73
around even of achieved. Doritos. And the advent of the human and the title.

137
00:18:26,9 --> 00:18:33,6
And the population that has had quite a profound effect on libel politics.

138
00:18:35,99 --> 00:18:41,49
Manning there are many proposals that are going through a small council which there are now other counts wouldn't even

139
00:18:41,49 --> 00:18:50,37
think about doing. And i guess that's my only because the ideas that are being generated in them.

140
00:18:50,37 --> 00:19:00,18
And there's still a lot of conservatives digging the heels in against it. That.

141
00:19:00,18 --> 00:19:02,6
It will not be continuing

142
00:19:02,6 --> 00:19:21,69
and i think it's to the benefit of lismore castle around memories of being in the magic circle as one of the musicians

143
00:19:21,69 --> 00:19:29,09
in the magic circle was a man called paul joseph and we used to. Sort of a tradition.

144
00:19:29,09 --> 00:19:34,95
Develop their way we'd wake everybody up in the morning by going to just add a little of the wailing

145
00:19:34,95 --> 00:19:39,41
and singing to them and i would sort of a jab they taints and.

146
00:19:39,41 --> 00:19:46,21
In the end they'd be a whole sort of troupe of papal couple of hundred people singing made a long time sunshine upon

147
00:19:46,21 --> 00:19:55,37
you and. Another song about battle flies the poll of britain and it was very. Idealistic very pious.

148
00:19:55,37 --> 00:20:05,23
Piper ish and it was a very lovely way to start the die. A nice way to wake up to the truth.

149
00:20:05,23 --> 00:20:17,28
Very much the truth the door there was also. Wonderful acrobats. Posts and. Hi. Talk right. And cold for labor to.

150
00:20:17,28 --> 00:20:26,48
And he used to do shows in the middle of newman and put up a riper twain. Hotel in the uk and.

151
00:20:26,48 --> 00:20:35,6
With umbrella's on one leg and the children were just. Entranced absolutely entranced as were the adults.

152
00:20:35,6 --> 00:20:42,65
There was another troop of people. From new zealand cold blood. Who were again.

153
00:20:42,65 --> 00:20:48,09
Like wandering means straw paypal i had a big bass.

154
00:20:48,09 --> 00:20:54,05
And i used to put on show on the streets or in town or around the face of all sox.

155
00:20:54,05 --> 00:21:01,01
There was lots of the troubadour feeling later and a lot of freedom for people to express themselves

156
00:21:01,01 --> 00:21:09,48
and to take risks and they create and. There was very little judgement. The children were really safe.

157
00:21:09,48 --> 00:21:15,05
My daughter was about nine at the time and. I remember walking through.

158
00:21:15,05 --> 00:21:22,97
Faced of with her one day and she knew hundreds of paypal and every way we weighed eighty hard polish.

159
00:21:22,97 --> 00:21:29,66
And she just knew everyone from being in this very safe environment for weeks.

160
00:21:29,66 --> 00:21:33,58
And with getting to know people and she'd be fed by the howry krishna.

161
00:21:33,58 --> 00:21:37,78
And she knew sammul people and i did in fact that was true of.

162
00:21:37,78 --> 00:21:43,08
A lot of the children at the time it was a very safe environment and.

163
00:21:43,08 --> 00:21:51,27
I could go off and do exciting things and make movies and. Travel around with musicians and.

164
00:21:51,27 --> 00:22:00,54
There was a great feeling of optimism for the future here in lismore at the moment

165
00:22:00,54 --> 00:22:13,47
and has just become a mother herself. She was growing up into her light. Late twenty's there was.

166
00:22:13,77 --> 00:22:18,4
Some feeling all of why didn't i get to have a normal life.

167
00:22:18,4 --> 00:22:20,55
But as she got older she's by now more to look back

168
00:22:20,55 --> 00:22:28,09
and really appreciate the value of the upbringing that she did has and the freedom and the diversity.

169
00:22:28,09 --> 00:22:32,6
And one of her abilities is to be very tolerant and.

170
00:22:32,6 --> 00:22:36,93
To be able to relate to many many many different sorts of people so.

171
00:22:36,93 --> 00:22:48,09
In fact i think it's helped her to feed into society as it is today. Very easily. I guess traveling overseas.

172
00:22:48,09 --> 00:22:55,26
Help that process as well. It was quite influential for.

173
00:22:56,38 --> 00:23:05,57
Eight has and he needed one of my concerns as she got older as they were responsible and i haven't prepared her for.

174
00:23:05,57 --> 00:23:15,17
University and law yes. But in fact. It's the officers. She's got a great ability to survive well.

175
00:23:15,17 --> 00:23:31,3
Has very clear values about what she wants and what she doesn't want. Yeah i guess it's worked. You know reason why.

176
00:23:31,3 --> 00:23:37,77
Another memory i have of the festival was spending about how a morning up in a tree

177
00:23:37,77 --> 00:23:42,96
and attempting to put into practice another person's ideas.

178
00:23:42,96 --> 00:23:47,36
What sort of shelter you could make with a large flat sheet of plastic.

179
00:23:49,68 --> 00:23:54,52
After several hours and not being able to produce a shelter

180
00:23:54,52 --> 00:24:05,05
or something like the expert says i also eventually made it. I simple. Ridgepole taint which was rather take a bit out.

181
00:24:05,05 --> 00:24:13,47
At the time when the ryans kind of kind of proved to be a perfectly adequate shelter. I think she was rather placed.

182
00:24:21,12 --> 00:24:21,9
Ah yes.

183
00:24:21,9 --> 00:24:30,71
And i also realize that you can only follow the flat sheet of paper long straight lines so that it constructs the model

184
00:24:30,71 --> 00:24:43,96
shapes. That she had in my heart and it was really pretty and practically out that's correct yes.

185
00:24:43,96 --> 00:24:50,64
However the tent that i was staying in was a friend of mine and. It was a path to get adequate shelter.

186
00:24:50,64 --> 00:25:07,85
Because i was a parachute. With a with a plastic conduit framing and to travel was the parachute wasn't waterproofed.

187
00:25:13,83 --> 00:25:25,49
It didn't work so well. I think a lot of ended up in g.t. Stand.

188
00:25:25,49 --> 00:25:36,72
One of the characters i remember in the magic circle was a power to me and character cool i agree and roland and.

189
00:25:36,72 --> 00:25:43,04
I agree and was part of the magic circle one. Did various performances and.

190
00:25:44,15 --> 00:26:13,47
Danced around and told lots of stories and generally added a lot of calla i want to go with the double bill still.

191
00:26:14,06 --> 00:26:22,27
My name is paul and. I used to ride my motorbike from our strides up the coast road and look at byron by.

192
00:26:22,27 --> 00:26:29,44
My mom the indian places like that and i've heard of this retreat. That was set up on quite a few hundred acres.

193
00:26:29,44 --> 00:26:38,15
For gay men. It was called man and. It was run by a man called david johnson. Who was in the theater and.

194
00:26:39,47 --> 00:26:51,07
I guess vegie gardens and. He had a concept that gay men could actually come up here and. Do meditation retreats and.

195
00:26:51,07 --> 00:26:57,9
Do gardening and all sorts of. Alternative ways of looking at their lives and.

196
00:26:57,9 --> 00:27:05,01
So i first came out and went to mend our i think it was the spring. Tend spring retreat and.

197
00:27:05,53 --> 00:27:15,23
It was fantastic we worship the goddess of. Selma and. Selma. Would chant. With selma and chant the full moon now.

198
00:27:15,23 --> 00:27:22,05
And it was. It was a nice experience and. A lot of the retreats that david had with silent retreat.

199
00:27:22,05 --> 00:27:31,81
And so i guess the item was to get to a spiritual high very similar to religious retreats. In a lot of ways.

200
00:27:31,81 --> 00:27:40,71
But in doing so we got really close to one another and. Instead of the humbug rush of the city where you know.

201
00:27:40,71 --> 00:27:49,65
We really didn't get to say. One another personally. This place was great for gay men to go along to and to.

202
00:27:49,65 --> 00:27:58,72
Talk and discuss often sells and to get close to the earth from this would have been in the early eighty's.

203
00:28:07,48 --> 00:28:13,47
Oh yes most definitely. It was an acceptance of men sexuality game in.

204
00:28:14,2 --> 00:28:21,78
Sexuality and it made it a very safe place for us to go and to talk about such things.

205
00:28:21,78 --> 00:28:27,58
And it was a very open many doors for me and i'm sure hundreds of other men.

206
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:30,87
I don't know how the news got around the planet.

207
00:28:30,87 --> 00:28:38,03
But often we'd go to spring retreats or summer retreats and there'd be men from germany and america

208
00:28:38,03 --> 00:28:45,98
and so it soon become quite global. And it was a wonderful place for men to go to. From all over the world and.

209
00:28:45,98 --> 00:29:01,42
This actual. Country of. Yeah. I'm not too sure how it was fatah's and. But. Word of mouth certainly got around and.

210
00:29:01,69 --> 00:29:07,17
There were lots of different types of things we'd get up to like my paul and.

211
00:29:07,17 --> 00:29:29,09
Hear this chanting the moon up over ten and stuff like that was cool would be allowed so it was one of the first.

212
00:29:31,09 --> 00:29:36,02
Year of. The hippie movement was very accepting.

213
00:29:36,02 --> 00:29:42,8
To guide me to move which was still very young in this country at that age and.

214
00:29:44,21 --> 00:29:51,98
Yeah we felt very well accepted in the community. And. And we also felt as though we could be part of it.

215
00:29:51,98 --> 00:30:00,98
With learning about gardening and. Ways of living in the country without a pushbutton toilet. And without electricity.

216
00:30:00,98 --> 00:30:07,8
So it's good. Good training for us to move to the bush. It gave us the insight that gee we can live like this and.

217
00:30:07,8 --> 00:30:22,81
We can actually dig gardens and. Do without the. Modern side of life. Oh yes.

218
00:30:24,15 --> 00:30:32,59
You know all this more and more i believe got a man moving from melbourne and sydney and. Bruce been to this area.

219
00:30:32,59 --> 00:30:41,18
Because one it's so beautiful and to nimbin people are very very accepting. To us.

220
00:30:41,18 --> 00:30:45,78
And i like the idea of walking arm in arm with my lover.

221
00:30:45,78 --> 00:30:52,18
Down the street and not having abuse yelled out of the car windows or people actually.

222
00:30:52,18 --> 00:31:05,19
Commenting in a negative why are you sure. I've been on tangible now just for twelve months but.

223
00:31:05,19 --> 00:31:11,42
Yeah i admire the people that are there are various there and people are very exception to who i am.

224
00:31:12,39 --> 00:31:20,41
And yet the color is great out there there are people from all over the world. Living then and.

225
00:31:20,41 --> 00:31:25,4
I think that's added to a lot of the color that's there. And the children also aren't little.

226
00:31:25,4 --> 00:31:29,23
Well there's not a lot of little children. A lot by there now there's actually.

227
00:31:29,23 --> 00:31:32,4
Young kids and teenagers that have grown up there.

228
00:31:33,05 --> 00:31:37,69
Of which i've had no trouble with at all when i pick them up on the motorbike or in the car

229
00:31:37,69 --> 00:31:44,15
or with whether they're galloping past on the horses they've always got a smile and. Yeah.

230
00:31:44,15 --> 00:31:47,7
It doesn't seem to be a heavy prejudice coming from their parents.

231
00:31:47,7 --> 00:31:51,59
About who we should be or who we are all don't talk to them.
