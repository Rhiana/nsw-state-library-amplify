1
00:00:13,52 --> 00:00:22,98
I haven't been human that. Often racially. Like the kids that i grew up with that are still there. You know.

2
00:00:22,98 --> 00:00:31,36
I think that's lost low magic and even if you're really good place but just the period that we grew up just.

3
00:00:31,36 --> 00:00:38,16
Through all those. There's something about it that you hear of kids and adults that you know.

4
00:00:38,16 --> 00:00:44,04
Grew out of that experience is that incredible. And you know. It's very hard to break it you know.

5
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:56,33
I think it's one of incredible. You know.

6
00:01:00,19 --> 00:01:07,28
Well i will let some friends who live in a community is still not even in that need like come here.

7
00:01:07,28 --> 00:01:15,9
They're doing wonderful. Sime really good kids. Really cause this. I mean i've a few friends again.

8
00:01:15,9 --> 00:01:19,64
The still the drug scene of course. One of the reasons.

9
00:01:19,64 --> 00:01:25,71
When the change came to move to the bay chummed glad that i kind of moved from the mix there.

10
00:01:25,71 --> 00:01:30,88
I mean you can't do not there is a drug scene in the main. But it was controlled.

11
00:01:30,88 --> 00:01:37,78
Around us as kids it was never a problem at all but i mean few of my friends. You know show the.

12
00:01:37,78 --> 00:01:42,11
Into the drug scene a bit. But i mean. But then there's the kids too.

13
00:01:42,11 --> 00:01:54,24
On and they're doing wonderful things who are still there you know. So it's a mix you know. I think. Dan's. Issue said.

14
00:01:54,24 --> 00:02:05,38
The kids who have made that you know. Spread out. Everywhere really. I have to say. My stoner really happy. Like.

15
00:02:05,38 --> 00:02:14,87
I am and i can say to be one person. One kid. So cold he's probably not a kid anymore. Really one person here is.

16
00:02:14,87 --> 00:02:22,52
I'm happy i mean now you've all got your ups and downs. But if it was just. I think it produced.

17
00:02:22,52 --> 00:02:29,32
Are great because kids who are growing up to be. Optimists really i mean you know.

18
00:02:29,32 --> 00:02:35,52
Bad things happen and we get in bad mood and we all think all the whole world can afford top of this. But.

19
00:02:35,52 --> 00:02:37,96
In comparison to when else ways guy.

20
00:02:37,96 --> 00:02:44,8
Mice the tarmac in his skull we can handle this problem in a on its own as i mean martha's been main armadas. You know.

21
00:02:44,8 --> 00:02:50,57
There's always all i would have turned out the sign anyway. But i really don't think i would have. Artist.

22
00:02:50,85 --> 00:02:56,59
Yeah it's like. There's always the brand you know. The hippie kids who grew up.

23
00:02:56,59 --> 00:03:02,26
In that period their loss was wise to oh yeah they're living in suburbia. We can reform them.

24
00:03:02,4 --> 00:03:08,46
We're asking is the opposite you know like you see. You can pick them out the kids to grow up with that last fall.

25
00:03:08,46 --> 00:03:12,84
And they're the real they're the vibrancy the lady is you know that none of this

26
00:03:12,84 --> 00:03:16,28
or that the dad ones are just in the corner smoking and stuff.

27
00:03:16,28 --> 00:03:22,19
You know that they're really magic kids you know like a lot of kids are now. Have moved away from the men.

28
00:03:22,19 --> 00:03:31,4
They're doing wonderful things in the city. Like really outgoing leadership stuff. You know. Academically. Art.

29
00:03:31,4 --> 00:03:36,71
Everything you know and he was saying oh you know i grew up in a family here. You know. Parents were hippies and stuff.

30
00:03:36,71 --> 00:03:42,04
You know. I probably won't make it as far as. If i going up there. I think it's the opposite. I think.

31
00:03:42,04 --> 00:03:48,81
Just the way we look at laws. Is totally different like. Just a book. Our upbringing has made us.

32
00:03:48,81 --> 00:03:53,00
Have told from a perspective of loss. Which i think is really good and.

33
00:03:53,00 --> 00:04:01,71
It's just benefiting fully in high school in everything around me you know. It's really just incredibly ironic and.

34
00:04:01,71 --> 00:04:05,44
And new users may know when people say oh you know.

35
00:04:06,87 --> 00:04:12,25
Do you feel that those years were wasted all you know people think that that was you know the poor he'd be kids what

36
00:04:12,25 --> 00:04:19,65
are white. I mean. It really is amusing because i have to say. It's a total opposite.

37
00:04:22,2 --> 00:04:28,52
It was his there you see it was so it's hard to express i mean really they're all just totally amazing and it was like.

38
00:04:28,52 --> 00:04:33,12
If anything i'm wasting my time getting unitas say i should be out there doing everything.

39
00:04:33,12 --> 00:04:35,96
I mean realistically you know.

40
00:04:35,96 --> 00:04:40,33
That's another story but you know i'm doing what i'm doing and i'm happy doing it so that's fine

41
00:04:40,33 --> 00:04:47,69
but i have to say that. Weist. Is not even a word. I mean it's.

42
00:04:47,69 --> 00:04:51,55
You could name and you couldn't even think of saying all year wasted years as a joke.

43
00:04:51,82 --> 00:04:59,93
You know being sarcastic if you just couldn't really because it was just basically it was just an amazing time.

44
00:04:59,93 --> 00:05:06,6
In living in that we decide on this is really cool in heaven he's a fan. But reflecting back on and i think is just.

45
00:05:06,6 --> 00:05:12,84
When you really get used to blow yourself away i really think oh i can have a car we've had so much fun as a kid i

46
00:05:12,84 --> 00:05:15,4
can't wait to learn so much before he you know.

47
00:05:15,4 --> 00:05:22,76
They say it's really now that you're hearing other kids' stories and they're up bringing it realizing wow.

48
00:05:22,76 --> 00:05:28,9
You know that that i mean comprehend for me that i was in a political ad a totally different lost all.

49
00:05:28,9 --> 00:05:37,37
As thank god i did. You know those wonderful like your kids how i grew up and. Anything. How boring. You know.

50
00:05:37,37 --> 00:05:42,63
You think wow just think when i was that i'd also of camping also of learning how to make a boomerang

51
00:05:42,63 --> 00:05:49,03
and throw it out of our lot out of my cow and piper and things like that yeah i used to think that those kids.

52
00:05:49,03 --> 00:05:57,71
They don't have. And i might not never have. And i'm just so i thankful. But i'm also thankful that you know why that.

53
00:05:57,71 --> 00:06:04,67
The tom that i spent. Was really good. But now the norm. Out. I'm glad that on strike.

54
00:06:04,67 --> 00:06:08,95
Where come free to use the knowledge that we've had since we're kids.

55
00:06:08,95 --> 00:06:16,65
But go along in the last hour that we are away from him then. That's always a part of us you know. It's like. I think.

56
00:06:16,65 --> 00:06:24,45
If i was still in nimbin now. You know i'd be totally different saying they might be doing wonderful things in yemen.

57
00:06:24,45 --> 00:06:26,19
But also there's the drugs are.

58
00:06:26,19 --> 00:06:30,42
You know there's things on the tomah spent nimbin was just incredible

59
00:06:30,42 --> 00:06:39,74
