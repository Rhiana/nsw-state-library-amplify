1
00:00:11,68 --> 00:00:17,6
Combined with that resurgence of the national party's involvement in community politics and.

2
00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:24,52
The involvement of developers in yemen. They were a couple of very controversial.

3
00:00:24,52 --> 00:00:30,59
Environmental issues that were a caring mom was where the name was going to get a centralized game.

4
00:00:30,63 --> 00:00:40,42
The name and village. And the other was the issue of. Waste disposal as we had a landfill. That was practically full.

5
00:00:40,42 --> 00:00:44,93
I think those. Those issues especially the sewage issue really.

6
00:00:44,93 --> 00:00:49,84
Polarized the village there were those people who wanted it and so it is the only solution.

7
00:00:49,84 --> 00:00:56,55
And then they were the other paperless felt that we really had moved past the point of putting effluent discharge into

8
00:00:56,55 --> 00:00:57,23
crakes.

9
00:00:57,23 --> 00:01:02,07
Which is what was proposed for naman and that we really needed to find other molton to solutions

10
00:01:02,07 --> 00:01:08,47
and that was what newman was on about. And in fact it really brought the whole sort of.

11
00:01:08,47 --> 00:01:12,75
Alternative lost style debate if you lot. To hate that.

12
00:01:12,75 --> 00:01:16,89
If anyway if there was going to be anywhere in australia where you would say.

13
00:01:16,89 --> 00:01:23,4
Creative solutions to sewage disposal then you would expect to see it in newman. And not expect to say that.

14
00:01:23,4 --> 00:01:31,17
Traditional centralised treatment works with a clue and pouring into waterwise.

15
00:01:31,17 --> 00:01:38,57
The sewage issue has now being resolved in women's currently saying a centralised sewage treatment works being

16
00:01:38,57 --> 00:01:45,91
installed in the pots being like throughout village. But i think the process of coming to this point.

17
00:01:45,91 --> 00:01:51,88
Has been one that has been incredibly divisive. Perhaps one of the must. Controversial issues that.

18
00:01:51,88 --> 00:02:00,33
The villages had to deal with for a very long time. It's incredibly. Hated to bite. It's seen.

19
00:02:00,33 --> 00:02:03,56
Divisions occur in the community that. Probably never.

20
00:02:03,56 --> 00:02:09,32
You know didn't exist before i believe that we got to a point where people were learning to live together.

21
00:02:09,32 --> 00:02:15,84
You know quite comfortably and eight. Had respect for the other's position and points of view. But they.

22
00:02:15,84 --> 00:02:20,64
The serious debate brought up a whole lot of sort of underlying prejudice.

23
00:02:20,64 --> 00:02:26,89
And it was particularly strong i think because it. Focused on environmental issues and.

24
00:02:26,89 --> 00:02:30,98
People who've moved to name another the last twenty years have always been very strong.

25
00:02:30,98 --> 00:02:37,64
On environmental issues it's something that they felt. You know passionately about and.

26
00:02:37,64 --> 00:02:43,48
While i'm not saying that the paper lived here before didn't feel the same sort of passion similar to the environment i

27
00:02:43,48 --> 00:02:50,45
think that we perhaps have different solutions to the problems or perceived that there are different solutions.

28
00:02:50,45 --> 00:02:55,22
And the series. The series treatment works. You know really brought that to a head.

29
00:02:55,22 --> 00:02:59,07
And it's still a small drawing issue even though.

30
00:02:59,07 --> 00:03:04,14
It's been resolved as far as counsel and people in the village are concerned.

31
00:03:04,14 --> 00:03:22,01
And i think we'll see the effects of that at late in the nimon village for. You know quite a time to come.

32
00:03:30,33 --> 00:03:37,36
I think it's been a. It's been a major disappointment for paypal who were looking for tentative solutions to naman.

33
00:03:37,36 --> 00:03:40,03
I think. Niman was in a position of.

34
00:03:40,03 --> 00:03:45,64
Finding it difficult to find alternative solutions however there were alternative solutions that could have been

35
00:03:45,64 --> 00:03:49,51
considered. The issue there was much more that.

36
00:03:49,51 --> 00:03:56,97
The state government were prepared to provide the subsidy for any scheme. That wasn't a centralised game.

37
00:03:57,31 --> 00:04:03,86
In addition there were a whole lot of problems rights to around the issues that. Well if we gave everybody their own.

38
00:04:03,86 --> 00:04:10,61
System in their own backyard. Who would run the system council would be paying for it. And therefore would own it.

39
00:04:10,61 --> 00:04:16,33
But in. It would be on private property so there were these two issues that. Weren't resolved.

40
00:04:16,33 --> 00:04:23,7
And i feel empowered that the the state government and local government. If they'd taken a more positive attitude.

41
00:04:23,7 --> 00:04:29,62
To on site so his disposal and said. How can we do it rather than taking the attitude.

42
00:04:29,62 --> 00:04:35,54
Well it's going to be very difficult not really possible that we would have had probably a very different outcome.

43
00:04:36,96 --> 00:04:44,02
That was disappointing for late because i'd been involved in the debate for. You know two years and.

44
00:04:44,43 --> 00:04:49,81
It was disappointing. For a lot of people who weren't involved in it but who just saw the outcome and.

45
00:04:49,81 --> 00:04:53,61
I think it's that. There's a lesson for naman and it really. In that.

46
00:04:53,61 --> 00:04:57,01
You can't afford to stand back and white took decisions.

47
00:04:57,01 --> 00:05:04,22
Do you really have to be in there and be involved in the process of making decisions to have your voice heard.

48
00:05:04,22 --> 00:05:08,59
I believe that if we'd had more. Import from people in the village.

49
00:05:08,59 --> 00:05:11,12
And they'd been more outspoken on the issue at the time

50
00:05:11,12 --> 00:05:15,37
and it was due it being debated in council with the state government.

51
00:05:15,37 --> 00:05:19,72
That we would possibly have got a different outcome for the village. I would got.

52
00:05:19,72 --> 00:05:28,04
Side out that i believe that that struggle in women. Will actually have impact on other small rural villages.

53
00:05:28,04 --> 00:05:34,98
In that i think that we did a lot. To inform the debate on. Onslaught so is disposal and.

54
00:05:34,98 --> 00:05:41,38
I don't believe that out of other villages. Looking at what i can do about. Sewerage.

55
00:05:41,38 --> 00:05:47,86
Will have to go through the same things that we did and. I think that the state government.

56
00:05:47,86 --> 00:05:54,84
And council will be a lot more open to onslaught effluent disposal. For other areas much more open than they were.

57
00:05:54,84 --> 00:06:00,73
For name and so we've had to cater to the local government we've educated the state government. Unfortunately.

58
00:06:00,73 --> 00:06:25,61
Not in time to have a different solution for women. I often hear it said.

59
00:06:25,61 --> 00:06:33,89
In council by council older men and council staff. That lehman's a very divided community.

60
00:06:34,09 --> 00:06:42,69
I actually don't see it as such a divided community i think it's a very diverse community it's certainly a very complex

61
00:06:42,69 --> 00:06:51,07
community to have to communicate with. As an alderman to try and get a feel of what the community. Really wants.

62
00:06:51,07 --> 00:06:54,82
You know what they think they really want.

63
00:06:54,82 --> 00:07:00,69
It's so it's a very difficult community to try

64
00:07:00,69 --> 00:07:08,57
and gauge the feelings of those paypal who aren't involved in community organizations we have quite a few.

65
00:07:08,57 --> 00:07:16,25
Community organizations in newman and. The composition of those organizations. Primarily.

66
00:07:16,25 --> 00:07:23,43
You know people who've lived here for a long time who've been part of this sort of traditional settlement of nimon and.

67
00:07:23,43 --> 00:07:27,89
People who've moved into the area for the purpose of developing land.

68
00:07:27,89 --> 00:07:35,56
So it's extremely difficult for me to find any forum whereby i can gauge the opinion of people who've settled here.

69
00:07:35,56 --> 00:07:42,81
Since. Aquarius so in the last twenty years. The only way i can find out how those people feel. And.

70
00:07:42,81 --> 00:07:48,84
I mean they're not united on any issue. But just to get a general feeling is to actually go out into the community.

71
00:07:48,84 --> 00:07:55,54
And talk to those papers or to find people that i can be considered to be some of the k. People in the community.

72
00:07:55,54 --> 00:08:02,39
Who you know i've got good networks and ask them how they think on particular issues. Unfortunately i think.

73
00:08:02,39 --> 00:08:09,34
The naman and. Four people have settled here in the last. You know twenty years post aquarius. That generally.

74
00:08:09,34 --> 00:08:15,55
Those people are not involved in. Muti organizations are. I think in part. They've come here thinking that.

75
00:08:15,9 --> 00:08:20,71
You know they can get away from politics that they don't want to be any part of that. That.

76
00:08:20,71 --> 00:08:26,73
Therefore they don't want to be part of the community. You know community groups or.

77
00:08:26,73 --> 00:08:34,21
Community organization no matter in what form or shape. And i think that's. You know it's to our detriment.

78
00:08:34,21 --> 00:08:42,48
In some lies because the political process has worked very much. Through. Representation to say.

79
00:08:42,48 --> 00:08:48,82
Local government or state government or. You know. To whatever. Thing. And i think that.

80
00:08:48,82 --> 00:08:52,16
Whilst we have people who are making representations.

81
00:08:52,16 --> 00:08:58,47
To those organizations supposedly on the passage of newman and representing newman.

82
00:08:58,47 --> 00:09:04,89
If the other people don't get their viewpoint. Put across. And not represented. Then i think.

83
00:09:05,26 --> 00:09:12,64
You know they're generally not happy with the outcomes and don't get the benefit from that process that they could.

84
00:09:12,64 --> 00:09:19,28
I'm not saying that. I think that anyone who is. You know not involved in politics is doing the wrong thing.

85
00:09:19,28 --> 00:09:27,83
I recognise that sort of political involvement and. Activity. You know doesn't suit most people. But i think that.

86
00:09:27,83 --> 00:09:33,94
There are other ways in which people can have their voice heard in. You know just going in.

87
00:09:33,94 --> 00:09:39,11
Talking to paypal or writing letters so somehow. You know not.

88
00:09:39,11 --> 00:09:41,14
Not just sort of sitting back in the hills

89
00:09:41,14 --> 00:09:46,03
and letting it all happen around them all sitting at their in their house in the village but somehow getting out

90
00:09:46,03 --> 00:09:52,76
and at least talking to people is that very active talking to other people about how you feel about things. Has.

91
00:09:52,76 --> 00:10:00,58
You know. Impact on the outcome for the community and it might be only a tiny little thing. But you know.

92
00:10:00,58 --> 00:10:07,88
Millions of grains of sand my cup of beach and. You know they all have a part to play. So i'd like to sort of.

93
00:10:07,88 --> 00:10:10,85
Hope that you know i've for the next five to ten years will see.

94
00:10:11,1 --> 00:10:18,31
More involvement from paypal who you know traditionally traditionally haven't been part of community politics.

95
00:10:18,31 --> 00:10:26,68
Because if we've done. I think we'll say. Name and very much influence by perhaps the most. You know.

96
00:10:26,68 --> 00:10:56,57
Conservative backlash and also by the interests of developers. So. I think that in the early days that was.

97
00:10:56,57 --> 00:11:03,11
It was a lot easier for people to come here to just buy their pace of land in the hills just go into the hills live

98
00:11:03,11 --> 00:11:04,89
into the here. Live in the hills and.

99
00:11:04,89 --> 00:11:08,78
Just come into name and to do their shopping or go to list more to do their shopping.

100
00:11:08,78 --> 00:11:11,91
It was much easier to live that sort of lost style.

101
00:11:11,91 --> 00:11:18,94
Now i think the reality is that the hills have become you know sort of more developed this mall paypal it's much harder

102
00:11:18,94 --> 00:11:22,76
to pay oscillated as it was and lars dies. And i think.

103
00:11:22,76 --> 00:11:27,68
There's also the reality that that sort of lifestyle it is very difficult. It's.

104
00:11:27,68 --> 00:11:33,4
We all came here with our ideals that have been sort of shaped and whittled away

105
00:11:33,4 --> 00:11:41,18
and changed by the reality of living in. You know this sort of lifestyle under these types of conditions.

106
00:11:41,18 --> 00:11:46,32
And it's harder now for paypal to sort of sort of sit back

107
00:11:46,32 --> 00:11:56,08
and just watch what happens around them because they're going to be affected by it. That was a question yes.

108
00:11:56,08 --> 00:12:03,5
I think the key thing at stake now is that newman is in the process of undergoing more change than it's undergone since.

109
00:12:03,5 --> 00:12:10,85
Aquarius twenty years ago. That event had a great impact on the village and. Obviously the village to.

110
00:12:11,08 --> 00:12:17,18
Change direction then. And i think now. The village is at the point of changing direction again.

111
00:12:17,18 --> 00:12:22,14
And those people have moved here over the last twenty years and say in the first ten years from aquarius.

112
00:12:22,14 --> 00:12:23,41
If they want to see a name

113
00:12:23,41 --> 00:12:31,52
and retain the things that are important to them they're going to have to be part of that process of having a say

114
00:12:31,52 --> 00:12:38,57
and of putting for putting forward. The things that they want to retain. And emphasizing.

115
00:12:38,57 --> 00:12:45,57
You know the positive aspects of those sorts of things which are primarily the reasons why we've all moved to you know

116
00:12:45,57 --> 00:12:53,23
the greater emphasis on self sustainability. The less consumerist lost. The not being stuck in the.

117
00:12:53,23 --> 00:12:58,62
Nine to five five day a week. Work which chain doesn't mean to say that we work any less hard than anyone else.

118
00:12:58,62 --> 00:13:00,95
But you know we're doing it for s l's.

119
00:13:01,77 --> 00:13:08,94
If people want to retain the things that are of importance to them then they're going to have to be a part of the

120
00:13:08,94 --> 00:13:40,43
process of china. In a positive way. Otherwise. I believe they're not going to be happy with the outcome.

121
00:13:41,41 --> 00:13:50,24
I think things have come to a head in yemen over the past few years for several reasons primarily i believe that paper

122
00:13:50,24 --> 00:13:58,86
from outside have seen the possibility of of selling them and selling them into the the broader community and.

123
00:13:58,86 --> 00:14:04,73
I think you know it's. It's very real and it's definitely there. As a potential.

124
00:14:04,86 --> 00:14:10,85
I think the talent niman and paper live in yemen is to try and influence that process.

125
00:14:10,92 --> 00:14:13,9
And to have some say in the outcome.

126
00:14:14,55 --> 00:14:23,28
For instance i believe that it's inevitable that somebody is going to stop promoting named and more strongly.

127
00:14:23,28 --> 00:14:33,52
As a a tourist destination or tourist venue and. I am excited by the idea that the community itself.

128
00:14:33,52 --> 00:14:40,53
Could decide what shape or form. They want that. Tourist development to take.

129
00:14:40,53 --> 00:14:46,29
And i believe that if we don't do that then paper from outside will come in and do it.

130
00:14:46,29 --> 00:14:53,64
Which isn't necessarily a problem. Except for i believe that they won't be promoting.

131
00:14:53,64 --> 00:15:01,02
What are the things that are important to us the integrity of the name and because they don't know it.

132
00:15:01,02 --> 00:15:07,26
I think the other things are that the population of women is about to grow the village.

133
00:15:07,26 --> 00:15:16,6
Area has been increased dramatically. Of the last year. And we're now likely to see the population in the village.

134
00:15:18,36 --> 00:15:24,58
I think the other thing that's going to have an influence on women is that the actual. Area. Of the village.

135
00:15:24,58 --> 00:15:29,36
Has changed dramatically over the past year through landry's earnings.

136
00:15:29,36 --> 00:15:32,69
And we're now likely to see the population of the village grow from.

137
00:15:32,69 --> 00:15:39,77
Three hundred fifty to a thousand people which is going to put an incredible. Strain on the village. Resources.

138
00:15:39,77 --> 00:15:43,4
But will also sort of bring a lot more people into the area.

139
00:15:43,4 --> 00:15:47,74
We're also in the process of seeing the land surrounding the village.

140
00:15:47,74 --> 00:15:53,18
Rezone to room residential and once again that's going to increase the population dramatically.

141
00:15:53,18 --> 00:15:58,68
So there's these sort of competing interests as the population of the village.

142
00:15:58,68 --> 00:16:03,2
Increasing dramatically in surrounding areas. There is increased sort of.

143
00:16:03,2 --> 00:16:08,22
Tourist potential and people wanting to capitalize on that and.

144
00:16:08,22 --> 00:16:10,85
There's no way that nimble in its current shape and form.

145
00:16:11,31 --> 00:16:16,55
Can you know can cope with that name is going to have to change to be able to cope with it otherwise.

146
00:16:16,55 --> 00:16:20,00
You know we're all kinds think and i mean that's that's not going to happen.

147
00:16:20,11 --> 00:16:28,73
So i think there's a great opportunity for us to sort of say pare own future and. My word of warning would be that if.

148
00:16:28,73 --> 00:16:52,07
If we done. Other people will do it for us and we won't like what we get. Niman gets a lot of publicity.

149
00:16:52,07 --> 00:17:01,69
Some of it's positive. A lot of it is negative. I think. If you look at the name of nim and further afield you nuts.

150
00:17:01,69 --> 00:17:07,04
Almost synonymous with the name of. You know the word drugs. I think that's.

151
00:17:07,04 --> 00:17:10,16
That's very unfortunate it's a very small part of.

152
00:17:10,16 --> 00:17:17,55
Nim unlock it happens to be focused on the main street which is probably why it achieves a great deal of attention.

153
00:17:18,8 --> 00:17:26,86
I have seen quite a lot of. You know positive. Niman. Coverage. By the media and.

154
00:17:26,86 --> 00:17:32,65
I believe that there is that really a perception. In the wider community.

155
00:17:32,65 --> 00:17:38,72
You know throughout australia and across the world that newman represents a different way of living.

156
00:17:38,72 --> 00:17:50,36
An alternative lifestyle. If you live. But a troy that. Challenges and confronts the dominant paradigm.

157
00:17:50,36 --> 00:18:00,49
Now kind of remember. Well you know. I think that nim and certainly sick of being portrayed as.

158
00:18:00,49 --> 00:18:08,82
The drug capital of this trailer. And i think it's a very unfair label. To pin on women and.

159
00:18:08,82 --> 00:18:10,85
There are many of us in the community who work.

160
00:18:11,05 --> 00:18:19,37
Barry had to promote the positive images of women and i mean there's a multitude of them. It's not hard to find.

161
00:18:19,37 --> 00:18:27,61
You know so many sort of positive things about the name and last. I think it's been damaging to us as a community.

162
00:18:27,61 --> 00:18:36,43
The way that with being portrayed in the in the media. I think it's very common for us to say. Journalists.

163
00:18:36,43 --> 00:18:41,79
Come in from outside to do a story on him and when they really only get a very superficial.

164
00:18:41,79 --> 00:18:51,18
Insight into the lifestyles of people here. The name and village the complexity of the issues that you know exist here.

165
00:18:51,18 --> 00:18:56,09
And then go away and write a story that then. You know. On top of that gets edited.

166
00:18:56,09 --> 00:19:04,84
And we get portrayed in a fairly superficial way. I've seen some very good. Mady or reports on him and i'd have to say.

167
00:19:04,84 --> 00:19:09,28
And those are the sorts of things that i think we should be. You know we should be encouraging.

168
00:19:09,96 --> 00:19:17,8
I think it really also is up to the community to take the initiative. To promote itself positively. Further afield.

169
00:19:18,04 --> 00:19:22,93
You know throughout australia not. For the purposes of bringing tourists here.

170
00:19:22,93 --> 00:19:28,94
Although it's an inevitable consequence of it. But more because i believe that women has something to offer.

171
00:19:28,94 --> 00:19:34,53
To the rest of australia. You know to the rest of the world. Really. I mean we're not unique.

172
00:19:34,53 --> 00:19:41,78
But you know it's just something that's happening here. And i believe that. People elsewhere would be interested in it.

173
00:19:41,78 --> 00:19:49,51
And in fact i can remember there was a programme on the a.b.c. About us. Two years ago on katzman and.

174
00:19:49,51 --> 00:19:55,08
The feedback from a straggler was phenomenal.

175
00:19:55,08 --> 00:20:01,29
You know it was people really wanting to hear more about what we were on about the things that are important to us how

176
00:20:01,29 --> 00:20:07,77
we live our lives just really sort of basic fundamental things about how do we exist and.

177
00:20:07,77 --> 00:20:12,14
You know those things are exciting those are the things that i would really like. To share.

178
00:20:12,14 --> 00:20:21,08
And that i'm sure other people in yemen. A quite open to sharing. You know those sorts of. Those sorts of values.

179
00:20:21,08 --> 00:20:29,81
But i think we're pretty sick of being in the media spotlight when we just get portrayed in a fairly negative.

180
00:20:29,81 --> 00:20:45,95
Representatives on realistic way. I think the acquiring of aquarian ideals have had to be modified substantially.

181
00:20:45,95 --> 00:20:53,81
The paypal has sort of. Came here with the vision of living in the hills and of. Dropping out and.

182
00:20:53,81 --> 00:21:01,77
Creating their own sort of life and values. Being self sustainable. Have had to realize that.

183
00:21:01,77 --> 00:21:03,8
That's just a very difficult path.

184
00:21:03,8 --> 00:21:09,39
And in fact it's not possible to cut yourself off from the rest of the rest of society

185
00:21:09,39 --> 00:21:17,67
and that no matter how we lock it. You know it. It follows us everywhere. I think a lot of what.

186
00:21:17,67 --> 00:21:24,55
Aquarius was the aquarius best of on its values a lot of those values are still as still relevant today that.

187
00:21:25,87 --> 00:21:33,73
We've been at the forefront of a lot of change in the stroller and. Primarily you know environmental issues.

188
00:21:33,73 --> 00:21:35,5
Come to mind as perhaps being.

189
00:21:35,5 --> 00:21:42,86
You know some of the most important things that are less sort of consumer oriented last style.

190
00:21:42,86 --> 00:21:52,09
Which was you know very much part of the equerry. Aquarius vision. Self sustainability more reliance on.

191
00:21:52,09 --> 00:21:56,68
You know ourselves as individuals rather than looking at. Looking to governments.

192
00:21:56,68 --> 00:21:59,93
And the powers that be to provide for and needs

193
00:21:59,93 --> 00:22:06,73
and i think we have been able to sort of demonstrate that it is possible to do that around here not just around here

194
00:22:06,73 --> 00:22:12,66
but in other parts of australia obviously those things are happening. I think too that.

195
00:22:12,66 --> 00:22:19,74
It's given us an opportunity to enable us to provide a more sort of extended family.

196
00:22:19,74 --> 00:22:24,78
To build on a greater sense of community and that's very much part of.

197
00:22:24,78 --> 00:22:32,23
You know european and aboriginal law stars but it hasn't been part of. You know sort of white anglo.

198
00:22:32,23 --> 00:22:37,95
Lifestyles i mean most people grow up late home and say their families that. Easter or christmas.

199
00:22:37,95 --> 00:22:43,5
Whereas here i believe a lot of people. Live with that. With support from other people.

200
00:22:43,5 --> 00:22:49,2
There's so much sort of stronger. Community. Emphasis in community bias and the one thing.

201
00:22:49,2 --> 00:22:53,47
That is really important to me about niman is that our knowledge that.

202
00:22:53,47 --> 00:22:58,47
You know if anything happens there are people here who will look after me and they are people i know.

203
00:22:58,47 --> 00:23:03,2
They're my friends. And that. If anything. If my daughters walking up and down the street.

204
00:23:03,2 --> 00:23:07,3
I know that there are people on the street who are going to look after her. It's that.

205
00:23:07,3 --> 00:23:16,03
It's a very safe place to live and. You know it's a generally not a violent place it's a very sort of peaceful place.

206
00:23:16,03 --> 00:23:22,68
I mean we might get sort of vocally. Loud with each other but there might be a lot of sort of.

207
00:23:22,68 --> 00:23:24,94
You know sort of hidden violence.

208
00:23:24,94 --> 00:23:31,6
Sort of domestic violence and stuff but i'm talking about generally women i particularly feel safe in newman.

209
00:23:31,6 --> 00:23:39,48
It's a fairly. You know it's a safe place to be and. I think the aquarian vision was certainly to create a safe.

210
00:23:39,48 --> 00:23:50,49
You know sort of happy last of the papal. It's a very sound very try. Actually and. Well take out the happy.

211
00:23:50,68 --> 00:23:52,75
It is a safe place. Definitely.

212
00:23:57,83 --> 00:24:05,59
I think also part of the aquarian vision was that people would be empowered to provide their own housing.

213
00:24:05,59 --> 00:24:12,93
And that's been an area which i think it's been incredibly successful. There are a lot of. Own the builders.

214
00:24:12,93 --> 00:24:16,68
Around here who've been able to build their houses without borrowing money.

215
00:24:16,68 --> 00:24:21,31
And you know i'd like to stress that if you live on a multiple occupancy can't borrow money.

216
00:24:21,31 --> 00:24:27,72
Because you don't actually own in a thing. And that's been a really powerful thing.

217
00:24:27,72 --> 00:24:30,34
Because when you've got a home and you've got some security.

218
00:24:30,34 --> 00:24:32,89
And i was you to move forward in life

219
00:24:32,89 --> 00:24:38,32
and you're not stuck into paying off a mortgage you've got a lot more options with your life.

220
00:24:38,52 --> 00:24:45,31
I think another area that's been really positive. Is the concept of shared land ownership.

221
00:24:45,31 --> 00:24:53,4
There are a lot of people who would really record from that. To the idea of arming land without the paypal.

222
00:24:53,4 --> 00:24:56,82
Is something that's particularly pleasant to them.

223
00:24:56,82 --> 00:25:02,73
But i think in women we've demonstrated that groups of people can come together. And can on things together.

224
00:25:02,73 --> 00:25:10,04
And that it can have really positive effects. Through just sharing of knowledge and skills. Through the sharing of.

225
00:25:10,04 --> 00:25:11,32
Rays or says.

226
00:25:11,32 --> 00:25:16,94
Through the social support network that that offers a multitude of benefits

227
00:25:16,94 --> 00:25:24,54
and i'm i'm really proud to be part of a movement that's set that as an example for the rest of australia.

228
00:25:24,54 --> 00:25:27,65
I guess i'd equate it with living in group housing.

229
00:25:27,65 --> 00:25:30,3
In sydney where you share a house with a group of people

230
00:25:30,3 --> 00:25:37,43
and i mean anyone who's lived in sydney in a group house knows that potentially that can be a very difficult situation.

231
00:25:37,43 --> 00:25:43,33
And in sydney the opportunity exists where where if you're not happy in one group pass you can move into another group

232
00:25:43,33 --> 00:25:46,04
house you know it keeps your rents down.

233
00:25:46,04 --> 00:25:53,11
And there's more options up here it's not like that if you buy a share in a multiple occupancy it's extremely difficult

234
00:25:53,11 --> 00:25:55,29
to move from one to the other.

235
00:25:55,29 --> 00:26:00,54
So we're in a position of really having to work on those differences that are roz personal differences

236
00:26:00,54 --> 00:26:06,61
and learning to sort of respect. Personal difference and. To respect other people's values.

237
00:26:06,61 --> 00:26:14,71
And i think that's been a really valuable saying. About. You know it's sort of from the aquarius. Vision.

238
00:26:14,71 --> 00:26:20,64
And i think we've learnt a lot about communication. We've learnt a lot about. Conflict resolution.

239
00:26:20,86 --> 00:26:27,72
We've learnt a lot about. Just developing our own personal skills and. Those the sort of benefits.

240
00:26:27,72 --> 00:26:34,17
That you know the rest of the rest of the community benefits from when we then take those into a community

241
00:26:34,17 --> 00:26:40,29
or a narrow and i mean community in the broader sense not a multiple occupancy community.

242
00:26:42,62 --> 00:26:50,13
I think the benefits for for children of this sort of lifestyle.

243
00:26:50,13 --> 00:26:57,00
Tremendous i mean firstly they get to live in a rural area. And i think that has a lot of.

244
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,78
A lot of benefits for children. They've got spice that quite a beautiful environment.

245
00:27:03,21 --> 00:27:05,6
I think also the fact that they do.

246
00:27:05,6 --> 00:27:14,32
They are part of an extended family and extended social network is also of incredible importance and.

247
00:27:14,32 --> 00:27:21,72
I'd have to say on a personal level as a single parent. It's been invaluable to me. The support that are being given.

248
00:27:21,72 --> 00:27:29,48
Not only by my community in the paper that. I live with. But also by people within the newman area.

249
00:27:29,48 --> 00:27:37,38
Generally i think also there are lots of things being offered here. To children.

250
00:27:37,38 --> 00:27:42,79
That perhaps don't exist in say you know. In city areas.

251
00:27:42,79 --> 00:27:45,25
So they're learning some really valuable skills

252
00:27:45,25 --> 00:27:50,53
and i my own daughter already helps me with building you know she'll pick up a hammer and have to pick up a hammer

253
00:27:50,53 --> 00:27:55,84
and to line lutie at the age of thirty or whatever it was

254
00:27:55,84 --> 00:28:04,79
and dad just having a very a very physical life which most children who live in rural areas head butting you know

255
00:28:04,79 --> 00:28:11,9
tional together with stuff. I think another benefit for children is just the range of. Schooling.

256
00:28:11,9 --> 00:28:15,42
And educational options that are available to them here. I think.

257
00:28:15,42 --> 00:28:24,17
In the name an area we have six or seven different schools. With different educational. Philosophies and.

258
00:28:24,17 --> 00:28:30,42
Parents are able to choose to a degree you know which school they send their children to that will most suit the needs

259
00:28:30,42 --> 00:28:32,56
of their children. I can't think of.

260
00:28:32,56 --> 00:28:38,64
You know many other places where that sort of range of options would exist in a rural area.

261
00:28:38,76 --> 00:28:45,5
I think i'd have to say that my concern. In relation to young people living in this type of environment.

262
00:28:45,5 --> 00:28:55,09
Is when they reach teenage years. It's very often that those. At those. It's very often that. At that age in your life.

263
00:28:55,35 --> 00:29:00,82
The most important thing for you is to be with your peers and i can remember that myself.

264
00:29:00,82 --> 00:29:07,3
And although i lived in a in a rural area it was only two miles for me to get into town and i could walk it.

265
00:29:07,3 --> 00:29:10,17
Whereas for many people around him and i live a lot further at.

266
00:29:10,17 --> 00:29:17,58
Town than that and it's much harder for teenagers to be able to get into town to spend the night in town.

267
00:29:17,58 --> 00:29:23,43
Leaving in town and then to be able to get safely home. I think that. Communities really.

268
00:29:23,43 --> 00:29:28,47
Still need to do a lot of work on what they offer their teenage youth.

269
00:29:28,47 --> 00:29:33,91
And it excites me to see a community like town to befalls community.

270
00:29:33,96 --> 00:29:39,33
You know one of our most established community actually putting a great deal of time and effort

271
00:29:39,33 --> 00:29:44,91
and resources into looking after their teenagers and trying to give.

272
00:29:44,91 --> 00:29:52,53
Tane i just options within their own community that mean that they can stay there for a community like. My own.

273
00:29:52,53 --> 00:29:59,29
Where we have a much smaller population. There's a lot more pressure on us to get out children into town.

274
00:29:59,29 --> 00:30:04,73
To sort of be part of what's happening there. And then to be able to get them out again.

275
00:30:04,73 --> 00:30:11,86
So it is a challenge for us and it's one that i don't feel that we have. We have adequately. Addressed.

276
00:30:11,86 --> 00:30:19,18
I think the other problem for us is the fact that we do have a drug scene that so concentrated on the mind straight

277
00:30:19,18 --> 00:30:26,35
and it is a sane that's very attractive to. You know teenage. Youth when they're going through that sort of.

278
00:30:26,35 --> 00:30:30,29
Rebelling against everything. Cutting ties with the family and stuff.

279
00:30:30,29 --> 00:30:36,21
And that's a concern to me i think it's really important that we offer our children a safe straight.

280
00:30:36,21 --> 00:30:44,88
And i believe that whilst in lots of ways it is a very safe place to bait the drug scene is something that we haven't

281
00:30:44,88 --> 00:30:50,72
really come to terms with and that it does have this sort of almost fatal attraction to taina edges.

282
00:30:50,72 --> 00:30:57,39
And some of them will get sucked in and. You know most of them don't. But some of them will. And.

283
00:30:57,39 --> 00:30:59,25
Somehow we have to look at that as a community

284
00:30:59,25 --> 00:31:03,57
and i think it's probably one of the most difficult problems that we face.

285
00:31:03,57 --> 00:31:09,39
And yet one of the most important because it's the thing that most directly affects our own children.

286
00:31:14,32 --> 00:31:20,73
It really concerns made that. A lot of that teenage youth that really end up leaving them then.

287
00:31:20,73 --> 00:31:28,04
And i'd like to think that we had more to offer in terms of job opportunities.

288
00:31:28,04 --> 00:31:36,04
People creating their own employment i believe that you know i mean teenagers generally lay them want to go somewhere

289
00:31:36,04 --> 00:31:42,47
else. And it's happening from a to say. You know some of those teenagers that surely.

290
00:31:42,47 --> 00:31:45,44
Return to newman after they've been away for a while and.
