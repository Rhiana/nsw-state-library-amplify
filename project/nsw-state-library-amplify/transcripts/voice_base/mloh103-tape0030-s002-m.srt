1
00:00:18,26 --> 00:00:26,39
And we look quickly and. It was also important for us to have times debate again as women.

2
00:00:27,15 --> 00:00:33,22
For instance are part of a women support group which has been going to seventies and. It's been put.

3
00:00:33,22 --> 00:00:38,21
Important for us to get together and to talk about our own experiences and to reflect and to really encourage

4
00:00:38,21 --> 00:00:44,71
and challenge each other to take steps and be brave and display gap.

5
00:00:45,1 --> 00:00:52,94
And it's been important for the men also to get together and to explore. What have the in the limitations of.

6
00:00:52,94 --> 00:01:01,19
Growing up in the society on them as men. And what did they need to do to open up. The other aspects.

7
00:01:01,54 --> 00:01:09,7
So at times we worked separately and. Then came back together. Much stronger. Both much stronger.

8
00:01:09,7 --> 00:01:19,99
And were able to face each other and times. Work on forgiveness. Yeah. That was important.

9
00:01:21,51 --> 00:01:27,43
But it's not a problem with people who accept the necessity for him in this times where and

10
00:01:27,43 --> 00:01:34,21
when it might have been perceived as a threat. But it's. It's aimed a lot more can happen.

11
00:01:34,21 --> 00:01:42,56
By working together and surely separately. And then coming back together and. Mating is. As a calls.

12
00:01:42,56 --> 00:01:50,54
Rather than sort of hammering it at on an individual basis. Somehow that so slow a path. Here.

13
00:01:50,54 --> 00:01:59,13
So the women's movement has been a really important strand. I think in the growing in changing. And bringing.

14
00:01:59,13 --> 00:02:32,02
Aquarius to fruition. Here. Will get. You know. I see in these. Here. Allan andrea. Who had the default.

15
00:02:34,15 --> 00:02:42,85
But very much part of the aquarius generation i suppose i was a radical young senior tutor in psychology at the car uni

16
00:02:42,85 --> 00:02:47,65
at the time of the festival and. It was all of that stuff was in the air about.

17
00:02:47,65 --> 00:02:53,44
About leaving the cities about my world instead of the one that was producing the vietnam war and the oil crisis

18
00:02:53,44 --> 00:02:54,78
and the.

19
00:02:54,78 --> 00:03:04,29
And what we thought was the you know the the decline in the whole quality of life in the absence of any kind of

20
00:03:04,29 --> 00:03:13,1
spiritual magic dimension in life. In the lives of their parents i suppose. And after the aquarius.

21
00:03:13,1 --> 00:03:18,14
Festival it became obvious that some people were actually leaving the cities leaving the universities.

22
00:03:18,14 --> 00:03:25,28
Going up to leave in the way that we were all. Starting to talk about. And the beginning of not in seventy five.

23
00:03:27,43 --> 00:03:28,96
I already knew some.

24
00:03:28,96 --> 00:03:33,54
Some friends who had already come up to to leave that name and had lifted jobs

25
00:03:33,54 --> 00:03:45,45
and so i got to be friends got to be part of a group who were interested in buying a huge area of land and.

26
00:03:45,45 --> 00:03:56,5
A little bit west of newman where we could have a virtually self-sufficient. Place. Almost a self sufficient. Town.

27
00:03:56,5 --> 00:04:04,3
And basically about twenty five shareholders twenty five groups. Some a couple some with single people.

28
00:04:05,07 --> 00:04:11,35
Bought six hundred thousand acres of land out in the heat of the clarence river and a couple of as waste of human.

29
00:04:14,14 --> 00:04:17,13
Yeah. Carol we knew it was.

30
00:04:17,28 --> 00:04:19,62
It's really a wilderness it's the headwaters of the plants

31
00:04:19,62 --> 00:04:26,78
and the cataract rivers so it's completely mountainous with some tiny little bits of flat land perfectly suited to it

32
00:04:26,78 --> 00:04:32,22
to a commune for lots of people to live on because it's magic country. It's.

33
00:04:32,22 --> 00:04:39,02
Miles of literally miles of these rivers because they they snake around all the mountains and.

34
00:04:39,02 --> 00:04:47,65
Magic mushrooms grew there in profusion. And you couldn't. Very much so it looked like a lot of hard work.

35
00:04:47,65 --> 00:04:56,55
It was just really interesting country. It was not. Hundreds of miles away but on the. And he sort of.

36
00:04:56,55 --> 00:05:05,1
Seventy kilometers or so away from the coast. And we thought that. What we do is go. Move up there and have a.

37
00:05:05,1 --> 00:05:11,16
Be able to to make a truly self-sufficient sort of law start with some of the heartache.

38
00:05:12,39 --> 00:05:19,54
Things like peace founding and. Organic agriculture that were things studied in the in the new ideas.

39
00:05:19,54 --> 00:05:21,54
Institutions in america.

40
00:05:25,15 --> 00:05:32,38
We were a mixed group and basically the group started with a group called design farm from listeners trailer.

41
00:05:32,38 --> 00:05:41,37
Which was a core group of. A couple of architects and a couple of engineers who tended to to build and design.

42
00:05:41,37 --> 00:05:49,35
Whole mining towns in witness tried including putting in the water supply and. The electricity supply power supply and.

43
00:05:49,35 --> 00:05:56,23
Roads and. All that sort of thing and they found they work out to a lot of kind of.

44
00:05:56,23 --> 00:06:01,39
People who would like to work for six or nine months intensively but one nine to five. So the people.

45
00:06:04,24 --> 00:06:08,38
That was a group got together together with them. And i was in western australia and.

46
00:06:08,38 --> 00:06:12,2
And the other half of the group came from sydney. We are a mixed bunch of.

47
00:06:13,03 --> 00:06:17,13
I was an academic there were some musicians and. Just.

48
00:06:17,42 --> 00:06:24,38
Generally people who are interested in creating our own lifestyle i suppose and and.

49
00:06:24,38 --> 00:06:32,72
You know living the way that we were. We were thinking. Challenging the existing andi's of family and. Economy and.

50
00:06:32,72 --> 00:06:34,51
The whole business of.

51
00:06:34,51 --> 00:06:39,99
Having an older generation who are conscripting is to go to war was we didn't believe in against.

52
00:06:41,21 --> 00:06:42,49
You know the threat of.

53
00:06:42,49 --> 00:06:46,93
So-called threat of communism when we had thought that we needed a lot more communality in their lives

54
00:06:46,93 --> 00:06:57,51
and a lot more sharing in the lovelace. Just working to increase. Money. And we already had plenty. In our member.

55
00:06:57,51 --> 00:07:05,5
Just before we came up. But before we left the city. We had a draft dodgers.

56
00:07:05,5 --> 00:07:10,25
Sort of organization going that we had hired people who'd already been conscripted in the lottery.

57
00:07:11,98 --> 00:07:18,21
And we brought you have to sink as the russian poet. To speak at new south wales university. Which was a real.

58
00:07:20,12 --> 00:07:25,26
Really thawing in the face of a government who was saying. The conscripting is to thought.

59
00:07:25,79 --> 00:07:43,63
You know the the communist system in. You know let me set the stage it. Was by stunnel. Principles.

60
00:07:43,63 --> 00:07:45,98
You know ideas from living.

61
00:07:45,98 --> 00:07:46,27
Communally

62
00:07:46,27 --> 00:07:55,45
and nonviolently as the american indians did ideas from the eastern religions which were starting to to embrace and to.

63
00:07:57,42 --> 00:08:01,93
Understand and follow at that time a lot of ideas about having.

64
00:08:01,93 --> 00:08:11,03
Magic as well as a spiritual dimension in their lives from in such way psychedelic drugs. But very much.

65
00:08:11,03 --> 00:08:17,69
I think very much it was just an adventure. Very much. Life in the city. He was.

66
00:08:17,69 --> 00:08:22,37
Was quite comfortable the country was will see. It was easy to get scholarships.

67
00:08:22,37 --> 00:08:28,96
To go to university it was easy to be paid to do research on social sciences and.

68
00:08:28,96 --> 00:08:35,23
How the family was breaking down and when you need a personal and family structures and economic structures

69
00:08:35,23 --> 00:08:40,82
when needed and. We just saw the opportunity to go out and start doing instead of just talking about it.

70
00:08:40,82 --> 00:08:47,23
A member of the couple of years before i left i organized a course called a family in the modern world in the.

71
00:08:47,23 --> 00:08:55,69
Behavioral sciences school with contributions from sociologists and psychologists and. And answer politest. And after.

72
00:08:55,69 --> 00:09:01,15
Having all sorts of people speak in that course including people who'd come up and leave the name and already.

73
00:09:01,76 --> 00:09:10,3
It was just time for any of us who could to to get up and actually do it and not just talk about and theorize about it.

74
00:09:13,85 --> 00:09:19,67
Well in the early days in the early years it was wonderful it was a it was a celebration it was an adventure it was

75
00:09:19,67 --> 00:09:26,65
found it was very creative. We were a buzz with talk about how to build dams and.

76
00:09:26,65 --> 00:09:32,88
Dodecahedron zoo and how to put on water supplies from hydraulic rams which didn't they do any.

77
00:09:32,88 --> 00:09:40,23
Electricity and all sorts of alternative ways of. Refrigeration and. Fish farming and.

78
00:09:40,23 --> 00:09:45,23
Agriculture that didn't they'd chemicals and. Didn't abuse animals and.

79
00:09:45,23 --> 00:09:53,57
New forms of relationships and looking at the children and their own music and. Just really.

80
00:09:53,57 --> 00:10:00,17
All facets of life it was fascinating it was energetic it was very colorful and. We use.

81
00:10:00,17 --> 00:10:04,66
We wouldn't touch alcohol because that was the drug of the older generation.

82
00:10:04,66 --> 00:10:09,07
We smoked a lot of it in a very celebratory sort of.

83
00:10:09,07 --> 00:10:15,45
Happy way rather than trying to watch as it was that in any scenes that was really the last thing that any of us would

84
00:10:15,45 --> 00:10:21,39
would want to do that. Studies because life was so full of possibilities and.

85
00:10:21,39 --> 00:10:24,33
Hasn't done is to be built in water supplies to be put on and.

86
00:10:24,33 --> 00:10:30,73
New ways of living in thinking to be found in your allegiance to explore. New aspects of the.

87
00:10:30,73 --> 00:10:37,2
The internal world through. Through psychedelics and so on and. I remember.

88
00:10:37,2 --> 00:10:43,52
Saturday mornings in the promenade mornings where everyone would come from there. From their wake of.

89
00:10:43,52 --> 00:10:47,24
Trying to get a new lifestyle going to the way they colors and.

90
00:10:47,24 --> 00:10:51,94
The ride up and down and talk to one another in the shannon market and a couple of the.

91
00:10:51,94 --> 00:10:57,16
Was that was the first market and that was them. The monthly. Get together with people from other villages and.

92
00:10:57,16 --> 00:11:02,08
People too far away to see in the menards saturday mornings.

93
00:11:02,08 --> 00:11:09,99
The best thing about the shannon markets was coffee because we all. We're all the reason the city folks and that.

94
00:11:09,99 --> 00:11:13,89
That was probably a really important thing in our lives.

95
00:11:22,57 --> 00:11:30,71
Care when your experiment was a bit different to the neiman one in that it was so isolated and such a vast area.

96
00:11:30,71 --> 00:11:31,81
And it really needed.

97
00:11:33,39 --> 00:11:42,2
Probably a dozen people families to be there at once in order to get such a big place going to to do something about

98
00:11:42,2 --> 00:11:50,19
the river as far as supplying. Regular water and. Accommodation and. We would only go to town once a week.

99
00:11:50,59 --> 00:11:56,6
And the difficulty with kara we knew is that we somehow just didn't get that many people coming at once.

100
00:12:00,53 --> 00:12:07,17
That was the only downside otherwise it was. It was quite wonderful to be a long way away from home and.

101
00:12:07,17 --> 00:12:23,76
And in a very special and vast place. They didn't. I didn't because. I think mainly because not all twenty.

102
00:12:23,76 --> 00:12:25,68
Shareholders came over and made it go

103
00:12:25,68 --> 00:12:32,68
and we would have needed that many moments that many to do the sorts of projects that we wanted to.

104
00:12:32,68 --> 00:12:39,55
And we needed everybody to bring all of the capital and. All of the time. To the place and get it going and.

105
00:12:39,55 --> 00:12:41,15
When we came to care we knew and

106
00:12:41,15 --> 00:12:46,85
when we bought it it looked like the quality of life in the cities was declining faily rapidly there was also an oil

107
00:12:46,85 --> 00:12:54,07
crisis on when. For some reason the i picked countries. Cut their supplies because they thought that this.

108
00:12:54,07 --> 00:13:00,37
They supply of oil was quite finite and limited. And now they don't think that anymore. So they produce more.

109
00:13:01,38 --> 00:13:03,3
But at that time.

110
00:13:03,3 --> 00:13:08,66
They were some of the agency in finding alternative ways of life that didn't depend on fossil fuels and.

111
00:13:08,66 --> 00:13:17,67
Limited resources. But of that concurrently with not in seventy five seventy six when we went up the.

112
00:13:17,67 --> 00:13:25,28
The oil across a sort of. Past the past over and. Things in the cities. Started to get gradually better.

113
00:13:25,28 --> 00:13:30,36
And somehow not enough people were really willing to sell up

114
00:13:30,36 --> 00:13:35,54
and bring all the time in a live resources to care we need to make it. To make it work.

115
00:13:35,54 --> 00:13:42,57
And i think it was such an ambitious project that it needed. All that time and energy and money to to make a go of it.

116
00:13:42,57 --> 00:13:46,68
So it turned out rather than the. Real distant retreat.

117
00:13:48,01 --> 00:13:52,63
And that one stage we had plans of turning it over to the national parks association.

118
00:13:52,63 --> 00:13:58,28
To make a national park of the whole thing. And it's pretty much that man.

119
00:14:05,31 --> 00:14:13,37
We are aiming for a real self-sufficiency were i mean for a place which really could take care and be a complete.

120
00:14:13,37 --> 00:14:22,14
Country. As a self-sufficient country and. For for a group of people.

121
00:14:22,14 --> 00:14:30,2
And we had the idea you had in mind was problems in western australia which was an area of land in western australia

122
00:14:30,2 --> 00:14:32,95
that. Fellow calling for prince rupert.

123
00:14:33,48 --> 00:14:41,04
Took over and he should resign stamps and banknotes and seceded from the commonwealth probably not legally and.

124
00:14:41,04 --> 00:14:47,4
In fact the lawyer who'd been helping him to arrange all that business. Was in contact with a lawyer.

125
00:14:47,4 --> 00:14:48,6
John accidents in the u.k.

126
00:14:48,6 --> 00:14:53,07
In lismore who who we got in contact with and he was the lawyer for kara

127
00:14:53,07 --> 00:14:58,72
when you're so we were thinking along those sorts of lines it was going to be totally self-sufficient. Heartache.

128
00:14:58,72 --> 00:15:10,94
New age. Sort of place. And when that. Skyler of. The new the new world didn't work. Many of us.

129
00:15:10,94 --> 00:15:15,48
Can back to what the others who'd left the cities were doing when prepared to go back to the city but.

130
00:15:15,48 --> 00:15:23,2
We came to nimbin or. Village and places like that where where it was more people intensive and.

131
00:15:23,2 --> 00:15:29,29
Where there was already. And a new culture and. Plenty of music and. Plenty of company and.

132
00:15:29,29 --> 00:15:32,22
New schools read children and.

133
00:15:32,22 --> 00:15:36,08
That became important as we were getting slightly older and we were starting to have kids

134
00:15:36,08 --> 00:15:42,29
and kids were getting to school age. So i left kara when you eventually in came to nimbin and.

135
00:15:42,29 --> 00:15:53,49
Was involved in setting up the newman community school. Just at the time a daughter was turning five. That was.

136
00:15:54,39 --> 00:15:56,13
Here the community school was.

137
00:15:57,46 --> 00:16:07,18
It was set up by sickly john gagan dorothy smith who were two schoolteachers who had worked mainly in.

138
00:16:07,18 --> 00:16:19,25
Independent schools before. Jonathan. Carabiner in north sydney. And. It was a school which was taught.

139
00:16:19,25 --> 00:16:20,56
Completely by parents.

140
00:16:20,56 --> 00:16:23,09
Parents all reach anyone who had the children they had to do

141
00:16:23,09 --> 00:16:28,64
or die a week at the school whether it was taking the kids swimming or teaching something in particular

142
00:16:28,64 --> 00:16:36,88
or maintaining the building or whatever. And a couple of people john and dorothy i'm a sylph did.

143
00:16:36,88 --> 00:16:40,87
About three days a week the. Just just because we wanted to.

144
00:16:40,87 --> 00:16:49,78
We got grants straight away from the commonwealth government. To set up the school and.

145
00:16:49,78 --> 00:16:59,24
The grants continued to hold for the five or six years that i was there and we had about fifty kids from yvette

146
00:16:59,24 --> 00:17:05,1
and five to five to twelve. Just to primary school.

147
00:17:05,1 --> 00:17:08,76
And basically what happens is that the kids were very happy to be there

148
00:17:08,76 --> 00:17:12,38
and thrived there till they were a bit ten years old when they wanted to go to the real school

149
00:17:12,38 --> 00:17:21,29
and have real teachers and wear uniforms them. To all the things that we with from every escaping from. And.

150
00:17:21,29 --> 00:17:26,63
It was wonderful we had sort of formal classes in the mornings in the afternoons we played music and went swimming and.

151
00:17:26,63 --> 00:17:32,65
When bushwalking and exploring and. Visiting found in the back of. Japes and.

152
00:17:32,65 --> 00:17:38,29
Going on we went a lot of excursions all around the country to john allen caves over to the.

153
00:17:38,29 --> 00:17:41,39
Fraser island and we used to just take a couple of.

154
00:17:41,39 --> 00:17:47,96
Company vans and a jeep and take at fifty kids and live self sufficiently and cook and.

155
00:17:47,96 --> 00:18:01,02
It's very strong i think the idea was it just a continuation of. Parenting.

156
00:18:01,02 --> 00:18:04,96
In the school system up to the idea of a bit. And i think it.

157
00:18:04,96 --> 00:18:10,66
It turned out to be most appropriate a really good model we of course thought that we could keep on doing it until

158
00:18:10,66 --> 00:18:15,02
and go through high school with their own school but. The kids voted with their feet and they just.

159
00:18:15,02 --> 00:18:18,7
They didn't want to be taught by their parents after they were. Teen.

160
00:18:18,7 --> 00:18:23,67
And that usually will have a little bit of trouble. In the three months of trouble.

161
00:18:23,67 --> 00:18:31,39
In transition to the public school system and then they after that they did very well. Extremely well.

162
00:18:33,39 --> 00:18:38,23
We had the best part of school probably was the excursions.

163
00:18:38,23 --> 00:18:45,55
They said where we would not be worried about insurance and so on like of the other school teachers would be.

164
00:18:45,55 --> 00:18:50,32
Just take the kids anywhere that was interesting for their education.

165
00:18:55,73 --> 00:19:02,16
The other aspects were really really the music in the face to the dimensions of sort of magic and spirituality and.

166
00:19:02,16 --> 00:19:08,35
In life which was signed that's missing in the city and. Dial really combined.

167
00:19:08,35 --> 00:19:12,16
Right from the beginning we had things called healing festivals where we would all.

168
00:19:12,16 --> 00:19:21,54
On mass go to some place by a river on somebody's property or in the national park somewhere. And it was.

169
00:19:21,54 --> 00:19:29,74
It was like a festival or a bizarre of. Of healing techniques and. Meditation techniques and dancing and music.

170
00:19:30,11 --> 00:19:36,5
And this would be a big blackboard where anyone who could offer anything in the way of.

171
00:19:36,5 --> 00:19:45,8
Skills of the hill thought of meditation or celebration. Would write up. Some time of the day when that would be on.

172
00:19:45,8 --> 00:19:51,79
So i would start off early in the morning. At sunrise with some kind of meditation and.

173
00:19:51,79 --> 00:19:57,41
Continue through the day we would cook communally we'd watch each other as a community would.

174
00:19:59,14 --> 00:20:01,98
And that night would finish off with with music.

175
00:20:01,98 --> 00:20:07,21
In the morning we every morning we'd have a big circle where one sat in a huge circle which might cover.

176
00:20:07,76 --> 00:20:17,13
You know a quarter and i could have land and. We chant and. Hound. And then those who filled in.

177
00:20:17,3 --> 00:20:21,37
Have some sort of a feeling of support would sit in the middle of the circle and.

178
00:20:21,37 --> 00:20:27,34
And then all sorts of things would happen. In the way of a new age healing. Techniques and.

179
00:20:27,34 --> 00:20:31,41
Singing and meditating and channeling in a g.

180
00:20:31,41 --> 00:20:40,57
and Selling and healing faces which you probably have four or five times a year.

181
00:20:41,35 --> 00:20:46,78
Every full moon we had moon dances because the pair of them in so strong in the country.

182
00:20:46,78 --> 00:20:52,48
That you just need to dance to. To get the devils out of the haven celebrate your energy every.

183
00:20:52,48 --> 00:21:01,92
Every time it's full moon. And in between there were a couple times. There was a fight club every monday.

184
00:21:01,92 --> 00:21:05,73
Where people played folk music but it was doing all these things.

185
00:21:05,73 --> 00:21:09,79
To each other with we're shampooing each other's playing music to one another

186
00:21:09,79 --> 00:21:17,74
or building each other's houses of celebrating. Dancing. Cooking and washing.

187
00:21:17,74 --> 00:21:22,9
It was just wonderful to suddenly be part of the tribe and suddenly away from.

188
00:21:22,9 --> 00:21:36,58
Eventually away from the startling sort of nuclear families of the in the fifty's and early sixty's.

189
00:21:36,58 --> 00:21:43,26
Very very much it was an adventure and it was fun. And someone.

190
00:21:43,26 --> 00:21:48,86
People were often asking what are hippies about and we always said. He's have found.

191
00:21:48,86 --> 00:21:54,66
It was a really colorful celebrate three creative adventure.

192
00:21:55,13 --> 00:21:56,5
And when i got a name in these days

193
00:21:56,5 --> 00:22:05,23
and i see what other people call hippies walking along the streets it just isn't the same breed of human being until.

194
00:22:05,23 --> 00:22:16,46
It's some sort of leftover of a real real colorful lie that i think is that i think is now passed and.

195
00:22:16,46 --> 00:22:23,87
And in retrospect. I think it was. Part of a certain. I once life.

196
00:22:25,01 --> 00:22:33,34
Early twenty's basically the use during the twenty's when. When i still think a young person's got no business.

197
00:22:33,34 --> 00:22:39,85
Jumping straight into the mouths of their parents of lift. And where they should be out exploring new ways and.

198
00:22:39,85 --> 00:22:46,3
Celebrating their life in their youth and energy and sexuality and ability to take drugs without being too.

199
00:22:46,3 --> 00:22:56,53
Hurt by them and so on and so on. And it seems very natural for me and for other people now to of.

200
00:22:56,53 --> 00:23:03,32
As we've got all the to gradually go back into the world and to to hopefully have a bit of a dimension of magic

201
00:23:03,32 --> 00:23:09,06
and spirituality in what we do in everyday life as a result of having spent eighteen years.

202
00:23:09,06 --> 00:23:15,76
Being out of the mainstream of society and. Being able to celebrate and be in touch with their inner jian.

203
00:23:15,76 --> 00:23:21,29
Creativity and. Just adventure. Sense of adventure. I suppose in other generations people have had.

204
00:23:21,29 --> 00:23:26,9
New countries to explore. We had that. The insides of their minds to explore and.

205
00:23:26,9 --> 00:23:29,82
And all sorts of possibilities a relationship that.

206
00:23:29,82 --> 00:23:37,39
They were just awful than the in a very comfortable way that people. That our parents were living in in the cities.

207
00:23:56,76 --> 00:24:12,93
So few would be. I mean. What happened to me in the last. It's the last fifty fifty knees. Is that after living on.

208
00:24:12,93 --> 00:24:20,67
Four or five different communes i bought my own piece of property. I bought this property because it was lovely and.

209
00:24:20,67 --> 00:24:25,39
Had some remnants of rainforest on but it was mainly grass and.

210
00:24:25,39 --> 00:24:32,59
The famine next door came haven't talked me into having some cattle on it and showed me how to how to do it and now.

211
00:24:34,21 --> 00:24:44,5
The property breeds hereford cattle which half of which eventually get eaten is made by people including myself and.

212
00:24:44,5 --> 00:24:51,32
And now i'm a psychologist in private practice doing. Medical legal assistance for the system.

213
00:24:53,71 --> 00:25:01,39
Probably four fifths of my former friends. Gone back to back into the world i call it.

214
00:25:01,91 --> 00:25:10,59
In positions of authority and responsibility and so on in a position where i can offer direction and guidance and.

215
00:25:10,59 --> 00:25:22,54
An example to the people. None of us have done that. Really horrified by what's happened and. We look back on our.

216
00:25:22,54 --> 00:25:29,92
Ten years or so of being hippies in a village head of having led the system with. With thinking that we would never of.

217
00:25:29,92 --> 00:25:34,89
Not done that. It was a wonderful thing to do. When the full time of our lives and.

218
00:25:34,89 --> 00:25:38,3
That seemed to be the right thing to do it. That stage of our lives and this thing.

219
00:25:38,3 --> 00:25:44,68
This seems to be the right thing to do now. There are a couple of people who perhaps from our point of view.

220
00:25:44,68 --> 00:25:50,31
Haven't made that transition. And still sort of fighting it out on the streets of newman but.

221
00:25:50,31 --> 00:25:56,95
But i don't have an audience. The more in my mind it just isn't happening anymore.

222
00:25:56,95 --> 00:26:02,71
A lot of the things that we thought we knew and were fighting for. Now become part of the mainstream of society and.

223
00:26:02,71 --> 00:26:14,94
Course that's a good thing. I'm waiting now for my. My daughter's generation. To find.

224
00:26:14,94 --> 00:26:21,16
Find some way of really questioning what's going on with this crazy economic rationalism and absence of jobs

225
00:26:21,16 --> 00:26:30,16
and dependence on jobs and gloom of the present and. Wondering why they aren't finding some new territory of.

226
00:26:30,16 --> 00:26:32,93
Of the world of the mind to start exploring in ways that.

227
00:26:32,93 --> 00:26:39,53
That we didn't i think we've done and are exploring and had our age of doing that and. I'm more than happy to be.

228
00:26:39,53 --> 00:26:48,4
To be back in the world now. I think much strengthened and broadened by by that experience.

229
00:27:00,98 --> 00:27:12,18
It's hard i mean my maybe the answer to that is. Is of. I often wonder whether. I'm often asked whether we lost.

230
00:27:12,18 --> 00:27:20,74
We've lost. Those of us who have written and gone back into the world of. Somehow ditched their ideals but.

231
00:27:20,74 --> 00:27:24,59
My very strong feeling is that that's just. Just part of us now.

232
00:27:27,71 --> 00:27:34,73
Some of us still grow and but some of the still live communally but not many.

233
00:27:34,73 --> 00:27:40,73
And most of those things which we would probably take is the is the real external. Indicators of.

234
00:27:40,73 --> 00:27:49,1
What it was to be we now don't do anymore but. All i can think now is that i feel a real. Richness and.

235
00:27:51,57 --> 00:27:58,12
That bit of magic in spirituality which i don't think i would have had by this time if i had started living in the city

236
00:27:58,12 --> 00:28:24,64
that my peers generation and set up for us. I think it had to do with the whole thing i think it even had to do with.

237
00:28:24,64 --> 00:28:31,48
Sort of. You know exploring through the use of. Psychedelic drugs and.

238
00:28:31,48 --> 00:28:41,02
Just meeting new challenges or something it was very much a turning inward. Now and that is the richness and magic.

239
00:28:41,02 --> 00:28:50,93
Inside you that your mind is not just. Just some sort of capacity to follow an economic rationalist idea and.

240
00:28:50,93 --> 00:28:58,62
Work harder and. Accumulate things and. It's a real happiness sometimes to just be by yourself.

241
00:28:58,62 --> 00:29:00,73
Which we got from from meditation.

242
00:29:00,73 --> 00:29:07,72
I said meditation something you can take any way with you need that in the equipment for. And even. Still the world is.

243
00:29:07,72 --> 00:29:14,39
Permeated with other people trying to sell you things in order to make life interesting or make you healthy

244
00:29:14,39 --> 00:29:16,52
or make you happy and.

245
00:29:16,52 --> 00:29:21,8
Once you've been meditating for a long time you know that the best way to be healthy and happy and.

246
00:29:21,8 --> 00:29:25,15
And to feel magic in the interest is to simply sit down and.

247
00:29:25,15 --> 00:29:33,74
And be peaceful and there's a whole world inside there to look at. I think the fact that we came out of the city.

248
00:29:33,74 --> 00:29:43,07
At that i. Means that we just got a real closeness the night show which. Which we wouldn't have had before.

249
00:29:43,07 --> 00:29:48,1
And in many cases. We've got a love and a closeness to niger which even.

250
00:29:48,1 --> 00:29:54,24
Some of the old families don't have because we had that. The luxury that. The opportunity that.

251
00:29:54,24 --> 00:29:57,46
The joy of being able to walk around and look at it.

252
00:29:58,33 --> 00:30:02,3
With their mind stimulated with good quality marilynn earth cell and.

253
00:30:04,17 --> 00:30:11,85
Well they all families were working had a count of. Pretending they're enjoying very happily. And many of them.

254
00:30:11,85 --> 00:30:16,03
Kind of trained when i retired to move into town in a brick house and spin there.

255
00:30:16,03 --> 00:30:21,27
They dies and they are still club with the walls and floors covered with carpeted the artificial lots of.

256
00:30:21,63 --> 00:30:26,79
The poker machines. You know i look forward to.

257
00:30:26,79 --> 00:30:29,69
To retiring being have a look at the different lights in the countryside

258
00:30:29,69 --> 00:30:37,44
and maybe learning kept to them in watercolors. And returning. In a sense to those lovely hippy days when.

259
00:30:37,44 --> 00:30:45,82
When we had endless time and. And we could see that the world in the mind was endless and.

260
00:30:45,82 --> 00:31:13,06
The even mysterious and so on and. I think that. A lot of the things that we came up he specifically to do.

261
00:31:13,06 --> 00:31:20,54
Like to get away from nuclear families to get away from monogamy to get away from private property

262
00:31:20,54 --> 00:31:31,94
and to guide tribal and and someone really not with that. And in some ways it doesn't matter because they were in the.

263
00:31:31,94 --> 00:31:33,21
In retrospect.

264
00:31:33,21 --> 00:31:36,71
The kind of symptoms of what was wrong and how we felt trapped

265
00:31:36,71 --> 00:31:44,84
and how we feel very one dimensional in their lives in the city. You can. You can.

266
00:31:44,84 --> 00:31:50,52
We found out that you can have a closeness. To each other physical closeness.

267
00:31:50,52 --> 00:31:53,92
Trust that sort of injury and interactive. Life with each other without.
