1
00:00:19,36 --> 00:00:30,61
Right i will i'm harry freeman. And. I'm forty eight. An aquarian. An aquarian monkey in the chinese.

2
00:00:31,73 --> 00:00:43,03
Why of looking at astrology. And i now work. As the director of psychiatric services. Up in this part of the state.

3
00:00:43,03 --> 00:00:51,58
Running a psychiatric unit and. The community services are added here. I've always been interested in psychiatry that.

4
00:00:51,58 --> 00:01:02,37
That was my. That's my career. To some extent my passion i guess. And i came to the aquarius festival.

5
00:01:03,84 --> 00:01:14,97
Because of my connection at the time. To student politics which had tike in a rather theatrical.

6
00:01:14,97 --> 00:01:22,78
Sort of term and i think. By the early seventy's of course i was. University from not in sixty to sixty seven.

7
00:01:22,78 --> 00:01:31,46
In medical school. And the moratoria. About vietnam and now sorts of things were happening.

8
00:01:31,46 --> 00:01:40,97
When i was beginning my internship system medicare so i was active in left wing politics and still active.

9
00:01:40,97 --> 00:01:47,95
To some extent dean. As i said the more theatrical parts of student politics consequently.

10
00:01:47,95 --> 00:01:53,28
I was good friends with with graham don's done and with various people who were still on campus.

11
00:01:54,34 --> 00:02:02,75
Even though i'd left campus. And so i was identified i saw i identified myself.

12
00:02:02,75 --> 00:02:12,01
With that group of people who were talking about the kind of culture. That was.

13
00:02:12,01 --> 00:02:22,45
A peculiar sort of liaison i suppose between the left. In this rather more and call group of people.

14
00:02:22,75 --> 00:02:33,11
But i guess for me. I ride through medical school and even then. As a young doctor.

15
00:02:34,44 --> 00:02:47,37
And certainly in the beginning of my training in psychiatry. I didn't have the same connection. To doctors.

16
00:02:47,37 --> 00:02:52,18
As many of my colleagues deed. For some reason.

17
00:02:52,18 --> 00:02:58,82
I couldn't mike this sort of tribal connection to the rest of the doctors.

18
00:02:58,82 --> 00:03:07,46
That a lot of people did not that i wasn't a good doctor and highly regarded and. And.

19
00:03:07,46 --> 00:03:10,34
Fond of the whole idea of being a doctor.

20
00:03:10,77 --> 00:03:19,91
But it certainly didn't satisfy our need for a tribal connection which i felt. And which. People like gras am.

21
00:03:19,91 --> 00:03:26,96
And the more active an interesting student politicians. Did represent for me.

22
00:03:26,96 --> 00:03:39,65
So when i suppose it was like not in seventy two. Due to my. Various her listener janick connections to grier.

23
00:03:39,65 --> 00:03:50,6
He talked about doing at festival. At name been. I immediately said well.

24
00:03:50,6 --> 00:03:55,79
I guess we all need some sort of medical people lay you would remember.

25
00:03:55,79 --> 00:04:05,05
Now you might not remember me but i would stock. The film of woodstock. My.

26
00:04:05,05 --> 00:04:14,62
Quite a bit of the sort of medical problems that arose in the context of a bad trip spittal side cuts and bruises

27
00:04:14,62 --> 00:04:20,32
and god knows what all that happens when. Thousands of people suddenly find themselves.

28
00:04:20,32 --> 00:04:28,83
Together in fairly unsanitary conditions. So i said to graham that i would.

29
00:04:28,83 --> 00:04:37,68
Coordinate the the medical side of things for the festival. And i just gathered a group of.

30
00:04:37,68 --> 00:04:43,86
My fellow psychiatric registrars as a matter of fact we were all. In fact writing.

31
00:04:43,86 --> 00:04:51,84
And said you know if you want to come up to newman for the festival. And so we went up on a preliminary visit.

32
00:04:51,84 --> 00:04:57,45
To nimbin and discovered that there was a hospital labeled it had been closed for many years and there was just.

33
00:04:57,45 --> 00:04:59,86
A sister.

34
00:04:59,86 --> 00:05:05,27
Working at the hospital sort of keeping it open because there wasn't even a doctor in the town it was a dying town

35
00:05:05,27 --> 00:05:07,53
and too small to support a time doctor.

36
00:05:08,68 --> 00:05:17,28
And we came to the beis hospital in lease more with very long hair and short shorts and beads and all the rest of it

37
00:05:17,28 --> 00:05:25,42
and. Beads. And said to a rather astonished. Administration here at the hospital that i'd better open this hospital up.

38
00:05:26,31 --> 00:05:32,78
And that we would indeed. Manage and woman that and look after it for the time of the festival.

39
00:05:33,23 --> 00:05:36,59
And strangely enough despite have bizarre appearance all that.

40
00:05:36,59 --> 00:05:43,00
I required was that we show evidence that we were indeed doctors and there i were i stopped the hospital with nurses

41
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:53,06
and i handed over the hospital to me and my cohorts. So there i was at name been with the rest of my tribe.

42
00:05:53,06 --> 00:06:03,22
And friends. I was sort of wandering between the. The camp that we my dad or malcolm creek and the hospital and.

43
00:06:03,22 --> 00:06:17,12
So i was. Very much there. And. More and more. I guess. The idea of.

44
00:06:17,92 --> 00:06:23,66
Rejecting the dominant paradigm and being able to rejected by thing practical

45
00:06:23,66 --> 00:06:33,62
and impersonal terms was stamped in for me. So i saw myself. I was living in group homes and.

46
00:06:33,62 --> 00:06:39,71
Communal houses in sydney any why. Well that married. Me and my wife.

47
00:06:40,81 --> 00:06:47,36
But lived in houses where there were lots of other people living so the idea of living with a group of like minded

48
00:06:47,36 --> 00:06:59,54
souls rather than just on foreign media was again stamping for me at the festival so a few of my media friends bought a

49
00:06:59,54 --> 00:07:07,24
farm. While we were there. It cost us nine thousand dollars for the two hundred acres at nieman.

50
00:07:07,24 --> 00:07:14,62
And of course the locals thought we were absolute foods for. Even paying that much money for this place of dirt.

51
00:07:15,2 --> 00:07:24,74
But we were quite captivated with it and we could. All say that. We did want to live communally and most of us filled.

52
00:07:24,74 --> 00:07:29,64
That one way or another we could probably find some sort of employment up here.

53
00:07:29,64 --> 00:07:35,73
Certainly from a i knew there was no doubt. Because there was no psychiatric service up here in.

54
00:07:35,73 --> 00:07:44,98
Nine hundred seventy three. At all. And one of the other doctors that i brought up with me. Decided as soon as he hit.

55
00:07:44,98 --> 00:07:49,03
Town that he indeed was going to come up here in town and start a psychiatric service

56
00:07:49,03 --> 00:07:51,59
and that he would need of a friend and a partner to do that.

57
00:07:53,27 --> 00:08:01,43
So i would simply remind for me to go back to sydney then and qualify which i did the next year in seventy four.

58
00:08:02,45 --> 00:08:07,15
And then i was doing a research project in sydney.

59
00:08:07,15 --> 00:08:11,84
So i didn't actually come here and stopped work till seventy five or.

60
00:08:11,84 --> 00:08:17,12
From seventy three on i mean every holiday since we had the fam up here. We would have.

61
00:08:17,35 --> 00:08:24,46
Come here and indeed one of or one of two of the people moved up. By the end of seventy three.

62
00:08:24,46 --> 00:08:36,72
And so we had to farm and we decided to leave. Commune only and. To try to share as much as we cood that stuff i share.

63
00:08:37,3 --> 00:08:43,23
The tribal. Knight share of the migration.

64
00:08:44,31 --> 00:08:50,7
Was pretty clear to me and my friends that was what we wanted a sense of community that.

65
00:08:50,7 --> 00:08:59,04
In fact pretty actively rejected the dominant culture. But it's very hard to reject the dominant culture so we weren't.

66
00:09:00,03 --> 00:09:05,72
I mean we decided to get on to the green and we indeed i think the families were top to electricity

67
00:09:05,72 --> 00:09:10,81
when we bought it and we've been chopped down a telephone pass or anything like that.

68
00:09:10,81 --> 00:09:16,25
So what we did i guess as a group of people who were.

69
00:09:16,25 --> 00:09:22,64
You know capable of feeling comfortable about a level of compromise and accommodation are we can

70
00:09:22,64 --> 00:09:32,12
and i'm joined the tribe here and. Various of us got part time jobs and i was just tired of time on the fam and.

71
00:09:32,12 --> 00:09:38,34
We tried as much as we cood. To to to reject.

72
00:09:38,34 --> 00:09:47,31
Simple sort of nuclear living and nuclear aspirations or nuclear family aspirations. And so that's how i got here.

73
00:09:49,33 --> 00:10:08,27
You know what will work. Yes. Ah yes there's no doubt that the festival worked for me. As an affirmation of.

74
00:10:08,27 --> 00:10:17,12
The possibility of. Really feeling a sense of belonging. With a very disparate group of people.

75
00:10:19,24 --> 00:10:26,8
Who were indeed pretty different from all of the groups that i've now. Before then the possible groups i mean.

76
00:10:26,8 --> 00:10:33,29
I could join the medical try. But that would never interested me. I could have gone into politics.

77
00:10:33,29 --> 00:10:39,27
Because i was interested in that you know. At university but that particular trial. Didn't grab me.

78
00:10:39,7 --> 00:10:49,54
My parents were both. Successful schoolteachers and i could have continued on as. The fairly successful.

79
00:10:49,54 --> 00:10:56,7
You know upper middle class doctor which is what i would have liked me to bury and and move in that. Tribe. But.

80
00:10:58,04 --> 00:11:12,25
For my for me the the dark smoking. Mushroom. Eating. Tribe had much more appeal. And also there.

81
00:11:12,25 --> 00:11:22,39
There was quite enough. Well intellectual stimulation from a in that. Frankly i felt but.

82
00:11:22,39 --> 00:11:31,23
The group of people who i was who i was living with. Were wonderfully.

83
00:11:31,23 --> 00:11:40,56
Creatively intelligent and brod how mean i were not. In any why. Behind any group of people with respect to having.

84
00:11:40,56 --> 00:11:49,6
The sort of intellectual con contact that i wanted it saying to me that i were to the forefront in the area of ideas in

85
00:11:49,6 --> 00:11:57,42
in in in an enormous number of areas that were a very very rich tapestry of human beings.

86
00:11:57,62 --> 00:12:05,93
There was no doubt in my mind that out of the group that i belong to and really that i still belong to.

87
00:12:05,93 --> 00:12:20,98
Cyle the festival. Might it. Obvious that that. Tribal connectedness was a viable. To me provided i. I migrated and.

88
00:12:20,98 --> 00:12:31,5
You know hung on even through all the the ambiguity of. Of the thing because it would. It would be.

89
00:12:33,39 --> 00:12:37,53
It's not true to suggest that we had an ideology even.

90
00:12:37,53 --> 00:12:45,45
The counterculture and rose akon sort of writers would suggest there was some sort of ideology.

91
00:12:45,45 --> 00:12:50,72
That's not really true i mean. By sickly it was too.

92
00:12:50,72 --> 00:12:59,00
To not follow the dominant paradigm i mean it was a negative ideology that everything. That anybody else was.

93
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:02,56
Was hanging on to. Was probably useless.

94
00:13:04,28 --> 00:13:14,02
If you do have an ideology that essentially a negative one which i think is what we had. With all sorts of people.

95
00:13:14,02 --> 00:13:22,34
Pronouncing on their particular. Positive ideology and sighing. That was what it was all about.

96
00:13:22,34 --> 00:13:26,8
I mean you really had to be able to tolerate an enormous amount of ambiguity.

97
00:13:26,98 --> 00:13:32,41
You know there are many people who i'm sure you will talk to who will side that it was absent that that name

98
00:13:32,41 --> 00:13:46,81
and was about alternative energy or that. Name been was about. The hot. Saw that name and was about. Smoking dive.

99
00:13:48,63 --> 00:13:57,47
And indeed it was about all of those sorts of things but i was never. I never felt it was about anything in particular.

100
00:13:57,47 --> 00:14:06,17
Other than the rejection of the dominant paradigm. Because. And i was in my ignorance i spazz i.

101
00:14:06,17 --> 00:14:17,12
I felt certain that the dominant paradigm was a fire. And both. For individual human beings and for the planet.

102
00:14:17,27 --> 00:14:25,96
So i was confident that that what most people were doing. Was not really helping either them or the planet.

103
00:14:26,54 --> 00:14:31,46
But as for what we should do. In the face of that problem.

104
00:14:32,3 --> 00:14:40,52
I wasn't too confident and i just went along for the ride with a number of. The the things that because i'm.

105
00:14:40,52 --> 00:14:52,93
Focal points. You know. For for the new trial.

106
00:14:59,57 --> 00:15:07,62
I'm just as sure as i was then which i suppose some people would say is too sure. But i don't feel absolutely certain.

107
00:15:07,62 --> 00:15:18,71
But i'm certainly. About i am as sure as i was then that. The why humans. Rely to each other. And the structures.

108
00:15:18,71 --> 00:15:27,35
Through which. Most humans rely to each other in australia and indeed in the whole of the western world.

109
00:15:29,56 --> 00:15:36,56
Bad for humans and bad for the planet. Yes i'm pretty sure that we were right.

110
00:15:36,56 --> 00:15:40,01
That most of the things that were happening were wrong.

111
00:15:40,01 --> 00:15:49,03
But i don't know that we've come up with any particularly brilliant. Alternative structures.

112
00:15:49,7 --> 00:16:03,25
You know we've had no impact on the media we've had no impact on commercial ism.

113
00:16:03,25 --> 00:16:10,5
Consumerism or we've had a little bit of an impact on two things i guess as a local at a local level. We've had a.

114
00:16:10,5 --> 00:16:26,76
I think. A leading role in. Alerting the plan. To the environmental consequences of weston. Society.

115
00:16:26,76 --> 00:16:34,06
There are things like that which i think. Very powerful and very very important.

116
00:16:34,06 --> 00:16:44,87
But apart from that capacity to turn round i think a lot of people as far as the environment is concerned.

117
00:16:44,87 --> 00:16:57,45
There are not too many things that we could have been outstandingly successful in. In china this terrible.

118
00:16:57,45 --> 00:17:13,81
Slide that wherry in both as individuals and of course as a planet. Its own.

119
00:17:14,24 --> 00:17:32,13
I'm a bit naïve ice buys but i i wouldn't we filed i would just. See the problems. Of creating china which be.

120
00:17:32,13 --> 00:17:42,71
Well massive i mean. There are in any particular system. There are three back loops.

121
00:17:42,71 --> 00:17:52,56
Invisible feedback loops that are operating to keep things running the waythe. And. To bring about some china and.

122
00:17:52,56 --> 00:18:00,99
Even the sort of structures that are dominating you know. Al life at the moment i think is something that.

123
00:18:00,99 --> 00:18:06,1
That's simply beyond a small group of people i mean i think we're going to need a lot of luck.

124
00:18:07,3 --> 00:18:18,65
Right now for this terrible process that we're all in guy had seen. To decelerate i don't see. I. What the maybe.

125
00:18:18,65 --> 00:18:26,7
What impact the media have on my life at the moment but i suspect it's profound. And yet i can't see any why.

126
00:18:26,7 --> 00:18:31,62
In the past twenty five years that i've been a conscious create creature in

127
00:18:31,62 --> 00:18:39,39
and interacting with the media i can't see any why in which. I could either find out what they are really doing to me.

128
00:18:40,54 --> 00:18:49,95
Or. See how i could impact them other than the why that i have. So i feel pretty powerless in the face of the media.

129
00:18:49,95 --> 00:18:53,65
And i thought that the rod would. I guess.

130
00:18:53,65 --> 00:19:07,09
There are forms of communication i suppose i should sign that i just saw per vice if and. And at the same time.

131
00:19:07,09 --> 00:19:07,98
Undiscernible.

132
00:19:07,98 --> 00:19:09,44
And i will to be teased out

133
00:19:09,44 --> 00:19:17,64
and of a components that i feel pretty helpless so i don't know that there is anything more that we as a tribe could

134
00:19:17,64 --> 00:19:37,99
have done maine other than the frankland or saif to write or. Sti in a pot of the year which is visually.

135
00:19:37,99 --> 00:19:47,94
Very beautiful which is not. A city because i don't think cities are good places for humans to grow.

136
00:19:49,01 --> 00:20:00,8
So we've successfully. My urban rural migration. And stuck around. And become useful and. To some extent.

137
00:20:00,8 --> 00:20:06,02
An accepted part of that other tribe

138
00:20:06,02 --> 00:20:12,43
and now i think we've done about as well as we could hope to do i don't see how else

139
00:20:12,43 --> 00:20:21,75
or how more profoundly we could have impacted. Either locally. The last. Same for the national saying.

140
00:20:21,75 --> 00:20:45,39
Do you think this is a game you tell or just write. Well. There's not there's not a large migration.

141
00:20:45,39 --> 00:20:56,13
Back to the cities. So the essence of miking of rejecting. Living in cities.

142
00:20:56,13 --> 00:20:59,72
Reminds with our now i don't think we are giving up our main.

143
00:20:59,72 --> 00:21:08,77
Of course a lot of the things that we i earlier on might have identified as crucial to.

144
00:21:08,77 --> 00:21:14,00
You know being in the counterculture like having schooling air and kids.

145
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:16,72
And those sorts of things many of those ideals.

146
00:21:19,34 --> 00:21:30,35
Many of us have dropped many of those ideals but some of us still have them. But. I will all wise.

147
00:21:30,35 --> 00:21:37,24
Identify myself with this tribe as long as i can go to events.

148
00:21:37,24 --> 00:21:44,94
Where i meet the people that i've managed and loved for twenty years and where we sing and dance together

149
00:21:44,94 --> 00:21:55,17
and smack a bit of sorts of things which. I feel i'm most fortunate to be able to do. Most people.

150
00:21:55,17 --> 00:22:04,00
Middle class people in a fairly. Upwardly mobile. Sort of social situation have to travel and move and.

151
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:17,12
My career moves and. And i don't think that i can remind usually a part of a tribe the while i've been able to remind.

152
00:22:17,45 --> 00:22:28,3
Part of the trauma. From a growing old with this bunch of people. Is just an absolute traitor.

153
00:22:28,3 --> 00:22:32,19
So i will never same like a fire to me as long as we all gather.

154
00:22:32,19 --> 00:22:41,25
Even if a tiny three or four times a year at various events. But it certainly. That's still happening with enough.

155
00:22:41,25 --> 00:23:02,83
Frequency for me to feel totally identified still with the movement. That is what. Well. We. We wanted to leave.

156
00:23:04,25 --> 00:23:18,66
As closely intertwined with a child as lives as we could we really did. Yeah. Card. Well when we set up.

157
00:23:18,66 --> 00:23:26,49
Paradise valley pastoral company. We in our naivety i guess.

158
00:23:26,49 --> 00:23:31,44
We really dreamed that we would all grow old together there. That was the dream.

159
00:23:31,44 --> 00:23:34,77
But rather than being mom and dad and the kids.

160
00:23:34,77 --> 00:23:40,62
Moving about the country because of various peoples occupations and getting together with our brothers and sisters.

161
00:23:40,62 --> 00:23:49,17
At christmas time. We would stay together and live together and work together as much as we could. To gether.

162
00:23:49,17 --> 00:23:55,06
It was an absolutely beautiful dream so we would eat together. And we would buy together.

163
00:23:55,18 --> 00:24:04,97
And although we'd have separate bedrooms and sorts of things by unlogged. Al living time. Would be with a child.

164
00:24:04,97 --> 00:24:17,12
As a small hamlet of people. Rather than mom and dad and the kids. The sharing of. The money that was of course not.

165
00:24:17,84 --> 00:24:30,59
Possible. There was really know why. Of exchanging money for sweat. And in the beginning.

166
00:24:30,59 --> 00:24:38,71
You know i put in a lot more money than sweat and other people put in a lot more sway than money in the long run.

167
00:24:38,71 --> 00:24:53,38
It was very difficult for us to try to balance things out. And we shared. Less and less money.

168
00:24:53,38 --> 00:25:11,36
And sweat as time went by it was just not possible for us to do that dream. And we shared less of a child as. Communal.

169
00:25:11,36 --> 00:25:19,07
Lives too as time went by so gradually somebody will build a little kitchen or somebody would build a little.

170
00:25:19,07 --> 00:25:26,24
Living room. So instead of having bedrooms and everything else be shared. Sometimes. One family would eat.

171
00:25:26,24 --> 00:25:40,36
On there are no one couple would eat on their own and communal life. Gradually chinese need to really live.

172
00:25:40,36 --> 00:25:49,66
And in the end that's what. Paradise valley is it's now a village. Rather than a commune. But the mere fact that.

173
00:25:49,66 --> 00:25:58,67
Twenty to thirty people can actually share. The ownership of land. Is not a bad fate.

174
00:25:58,67 --> 00:26:09,56
And in the spirit and what communal money there is on rudd's and by sick facilities. Is still working there.

175
00:26:11,12 --> 00:26:20,62
What paradise valley didn't have all along. Was some deep spear. Ritual. Connection.

176
00:26:20,62 --> 00:26:23,87
And a spiritual connectedness between all the members.

177
00:26:25,23 --> 00:26:31,92
Whereas one or two of the other communities because paradise valley was one of the first six two of the.

178
00:26:31,92 --> 00:26:34,58
Six dominant are and body found.

179
00:26:34,58 --> 00:26:43,67
Did have a deep sort of spiritual commitment and i felt for a while as if that was going to my be how they mean a more.

180
00:26:43,67 --> 00:26:48,96
Communal style of life than paradise valley but in the event. All of the.

181
00:26:48,96 --> 00:26:53,99
Multiple occupancies of now become multiple occupancies and they are rather.

182
00:26:53,99 --> 00:26:58,31
Villages rather than anything that people would usually understand

183
00:26:58,31 --> 00:27:07,04
when i talk about a commie in just a villages of friends of loch minded frames with. Fairly similar ideals.

184
00:27:07,04 --> 00:27:20,79
Who have a capacity to exchange swit. But the exchange of money for sway. Has still. I think defeated. Most of us.

185
00:27:21,49 --> 00:27:38,3
When we've tried to do. What's. It's almost just. Tautological decided we couldn't overcome air conditioning.

186
00:27:40,69 --> 00:27:49,09
You know i was plenty of money so i could pass i some of the people.

187
00:27:49,09 --> 00:28:03,08
To do some work for me and for us at quite a reasonable right. Per hour. But there was no why.

188
00:28:03,08 --> 00:28:09,26
I could pif for somebody else to do something for me or for the farm. At the simon alley right.

189
00:28:09,26 --> 00:28:17,12
That i was getting bigger if the alley right i was getting as a doctor was absolutely extraordinary. And.

190
00:28:17,24 --> 00:28:23,69
I certainly didn't feel like prying the right that i was getting.

191
00:28:23,69 --> 00:28:29,95
For the other lie by it's possible that if i'd felt like doing that. It might have worked out.

192
00:28:29,95 --> 00:28:31,73
But i didn't feel like doing that.

193
00:28:31,73 --> 00:28:37,32
And the amount of money involved would have been extraordinary it would have looked and felt quite bizarre.

194
00:28:37,32 --> 00:28:40,66
But doing it any other why in the long run didn't work either.

195
00:28:40,66 --> 00:28:47,22
So in the end we couldn't do that sort of exchange i couldn't put money into the community purpose.

196
00:28:47,91 --> 00:29:07,16
Instead of working for a die etc etc etc just didn't work out like that. I think i did.

197
00:29:07,16 --> 00:29:20,65
I did a pretty good job of that. I i worked. I didn't work a name been. Bicycling. I worked in lee's more here.

198
00:29:23,17 --> 00:29:32,67
Well i kind the fact that i was ice psychiatrist and indeed the army psychiatrist for miles around.

199
00:29:32,67 --> 00:29:39,84
Somehow didn't have don't think it impacted rightly on my life and i don't think it impacted.

200
00:29:39,84 --> 00:29:51,61
Terribly importantly on the community. Except that i grew to have a close friendship with the local policeman.

201
00:29:51,61 --> 00:30:01,36
Which might in the event. I think of been quite helpful and. Early in the pace. His capacity to tolerate deviance.

202
00:30:02,45 --> 00:30:05,72
I think was increased.

203
00:30:05,72 --> 00:30:12,88
To some extent by the fact that he knew i was a reasonable blood he knew that i worked in the context of my working in

204
00:30:12,88 --> 00:30:19,49
the local city lismore. I was a respected. And. Ordinary.

205
00:30:19,49 --> 00:30:23,6
Well known all around when i was a consultant i was a specialist working in town.

206
00:30:24,3 --> 00:30:28,05
Sour i was one of the sort of senior doctors in there and even though.

207
00:30:28,05 --> 00:30:36,3
You know like superman i chinas into my hippie gear once i got back to name them. I think the. The relationship that.

208
00:30:36,3 --> 00:30:45,8
I therefore had with that guy i think was quite helpful. In his capacity to tolerate davy and so not to try to police.

209
00:30:45,8 --> 00:30:55,77
The area. Why he otherwise. Might have. And i think that would be probably the. The mine why. In which.

210
00:30:55,77 --> 00:31:06,8
I as a psychiatrist. Had some sort of influence on the plies it was an indirect y. By in a sense giving the policeman.

211
00:31:06,8 --> 00:31:11,75
Permission. You know not to get his knickers in a knot about this weird situation.

212
00:31:12,19 --> 00:31:18,57
That was happening there and of course he would have now died too which would have helped.

213
00:31:18,57 --> 00:31:24,14
I think in him not becoming obsessed about. About that part of the how.

214
00:31:24,14 --> 00:31:31,37
Process as well as far as the community work and you know the rest of the tribe are concerned.

215
00:31:31,37 --> 00:31:38,13
But i certainly didn't use me as any sort of counsellor or regard me as having any particular wisdom because.
