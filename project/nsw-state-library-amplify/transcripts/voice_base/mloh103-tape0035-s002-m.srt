1
00:00:13,94 --> 00:00:34,98
Ok. Johnny johnny. Chill on. Johnny allen. And i was a co-director of the newman aquarius festival in seventy three.

2
00:00:34,98 --> 00:00:39,43
And by dint of my role as director of the strain in the students.

3
00:00:40,19 --> 00:00:43,07
Since then because she had a pretty chick

4
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:47,54
and career leading to my current role as a vince manager downing have authority.

5
00:00:48,9 --> 00:01:01,08
Responsible for all of the activities that happen in the outdoor spaces of delhi habit. Yes.

6
00:01:01,08 --> 00:01:07,29
Nieminen the aquarius festival for me came out of the series of strains of things that i'd been involved in

7
00:01:07,29 --> 00:01:14,01
and one fairly important one was the one my one hundred first path either can accept with newman.

8
00:01:14,41 --> 00:01:18,63
And what newman was but for me as a side my early training was in theatre

9
00:01:18,63 --> 00:01:24,99
but i soon sort of became interested in theatre in the widest sense if you like the other in the streets as theatre

10
00:01:24,99 --> 00:01:33,08
and. Environment as theatre. And that led me into doing a series of smaller than syria and iran sydney that.

11
00:01:33,88 --> 00:01:37,75
Festivals but in the context of going up to a country like asians

12
00:01:37,75 --> 00:01:45,09
and exploring the strange environment for me it was a little bit about that it was as a young a stride in that had been

13
00:01:45,09 --> 00:01:50,34
born in the country in the end of the cd. It was partly about rediscovering. Country astray.

14
00:01:50,34 --> 00:01:51,89
And rediscovering the environment

15
00:01:51,89 --> 00:01:58,84
and then with that all of the questions that were being thrown up by environmental damage and environmental pollution.

16
00:01:58,84 --> 00:02:05,63
So the theatre was one significant strand of it. And now the onless what i would call the university culture.

17
00:02:05,63 --> 00:02:06,7
I think that.

18
00:02:06,7 --> 00:02:08,84
I was a student at the university of new south wales

19
00:02:08,84 --> 00:02:13,51
and i think the universities around australia are at that point in time i'm talking now them.

20
00:02:13,65 --> 00:02:22,69
Late sixty's were somewhat interesting. For the main ideas and. You know. Fertile ground. When i think back to.

21
00:02:22,69 --> 00:02:27,93
Many of my contemporaries at university where they've gone since it was an interesting time.

22
00:02:27,93 --> 00:02:30,47
So part of it was that sort of.

23
00:02:30,47 --> 00:02:39,2
University culture at isis i the mechanical side of nimbin for me was it was a job as director of the queries

24
00:02:39,2 --> 00:02:48,23
foundation which is something that you strain in universities and said set up to try and carry cultural. Circuit.

25
00:02:48,23 --> 00:02:53,91
Around the universities in the in the usa leading up to nimbin one part of my job was organizing tours.

26
00:02:53,91 --> 00:03:05,46
Of everyone from. Jeanie lewis to cool. Through to. Various environmental speakers. Ron called the cartoonist.

27
00:03:05,46 --> 00:03:12,75
Felix the original sort of folk musician. A whole series of things.

28
00:03:12,75 --> 00:03:17,14
Designed and way a possible way we took that in the direction of not just entertainment

29
00:03:17,14 --> 00:03:23,01
but in the direction of cultural tourism. I guess you'd call a little. Cultural entrepreneur.

30
00:03:23,01 --> 00:03:34,56
So that was one direction. Was of course. Rock music. In the. Years immediately prior to name and i've been running.

31
00:03:34,56 --> 00:03:41,77
One of sydney's only two rock vein use called the x. Factor which is standing golden straight. And that what the x.

32
00:03:41,77 --> 00:03:44,48
Factor was in those days was a bit of a home

33
00:03:44,48 --> 00:03:52,27
and a breeding ground for an alternative a straining music i mean many of the bands of the day. Would drag it cetera.

34
00:03:53,93 --> 00:03:59,15
In the arts factory and. Probably if it weren't for the factory they would never have existed. And that.

35
00:03:59,15 --> 00:04:04,48
You know some of those people. Like when a guy at your window on. Reasonable.

36
00:04:04,48 --> 00:04:11,00
Skewed you can feel the mainstream figures said to me a lot of it was was this business of running a music venue.

37
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:16,3
And one that was very much about generating. And the striking and rock scene.

38
00:04:16,3 --> 00:04:18,6
Because it's hard to imagine now an issue.

39
00:04:18,6 --> 00:04:18,98
Lived through it

40
00:04:18,98 --> 00:04:27,05
and can take your mind back to a strategy with the sixty's it's hard to remember just how how american culture was in

41
00:04:27,05 --> 00:04:34,48
those days you didn't listen to you know. Too much astray the music you listen to american music. When you watch t.v..

42
00:04:32,77 --> 00:04:34,4
You watched american t.v.

43
00:04:34,48 --> 00:04:41,14
So i thought of that process for me i was trying to get the to and genuinely strategy and rock music.

44
00:04:41,14 --> 00:04:47,93
Which nasa ames one one one one does now i have a can a for being an issue. But it was an issue. In the sixty's.

45
00:04:47,93 --> 00:04:51,3
And then i guess yeah the strand was.

46
00:04:51,3 --> 00:04:59,54
What i recall in my eyes stays as being called the counterculture which is a phrase that people that use anymore but.

47
00:04:59,54 --> 00:05:04,18
That there was a sane seen sidonie and i think quite a tradition going back to the thirty's

48
00:05:04,18 --> 00:05:11,45
and forty's out of the belly of the culture that was. Was a little bit more adventurous.

49
00:05:11,45 --> 00:05:13,8
Radical imaginative than the mainstream culture.

50
00:05:13,8 --> 00:05:23,1
And is a very different feeling in the cd that as i went back to the wonderful characters of the thirty's all of the

51
00:05:23,1 --> 00:05:29,28
lead of vines in the bay miles. There was a feeling of a radical tradition. And i was very interested in that.

52
00:05:29,28 --> 00:05:36,25
By that but i think that's culture. And peps eisai politics and.

53
00:05:36,25 --> 00:05:42,1
There was a how often the that name and represented the bringing together the. Things.

54
00:05:42,1 --> 00:05:44,95
And then i guess the final one was.

55
00:05:44,95 --> 00:05:52,42
What's become known now as is the alternative of will to have seen a little of the new age movement

56
00:05:52,42 --> 00:05:58,55
or whatever that is that. I think arrived a bit lighter. But there was also a sense that that.

57
00:05:58,55 --> 00:06:04,59
We were in some sort of crisis. I mean if we talk about holds when there are people thought you a little bit mad.

58
00:06:04,77 --> 00:06:10,56
But you know we were talking about those sort of things and we can see. Seriously weighed by them.

59
00:06:10,56 --> 00:06:15,85
And it's same to me and to many other people that i would. With at that time that.

60
00:06:15,85 --> 00:06:20,91
We were in a pretty radical situation we had to investigate some medical attendance and.

61
00:06:20,91 --> 00:06:24,97
To mean what newman threw up was just one of many possible directions

62
00:06:24,97 --> 00:06:31,09
and i don't think we were conceited enough to say that you know. This was the direction. But it did seem that.

63
00:06:31,09 --> 00:06:35,85
That an ace we explored some you know some pretty radical new the patches of new ideas.

64
00:06:35,85 --> 00:06:39,34
That we are probably stuck on a one way trip the pows. Waiting for proof.

65
00:06:40,58 --> 00:06:46,91
So i guess all of those thoughts came together as a background that. That led me into. Dropping out of a.

66
00:06:46,91 --> 00:06:58,27
You know fairly tired career as an a.b.c. Producer. Into this. Somewhat less fashionable of cultural entrepreneur.

67
00:06:58,27 --> 00:07:11,05
And director of the festival. One's always.

68
00:07:11,05 --> 00:07:16,29
In those things one's always a check to buy a range of things some of which is sort of.

69
00:07:20,49 --> 00:07:26,38
In terms of my own involvement in things it's.

70
00:07:26,38 --> 00:07:32,66
Looking back on it it's a little bit hard to discern the forces some of it i think comes down to fairly small

71
00:07:32,66 --> 00:07:36,27
and petty things like you like the people on emma very clearly

72
00:07:36,27 --> 00:07:41,39
when i grew up in a fairly conservative the strained household and. Quickly figured out that.

73
00:07:41,39 --> 00:07:44,17
With the sort of people who were involved in things like the

74
00:07:44,17 --> 00:07:50,88
or in the ads with more interesting than the sort of people that i'd been raised with so i naturally gravitated to that

75
00:07:50,88 --> 00:07:51,93
sort of people.

76
00:07:51,93 --> 00:07:57,16
And that meant hanging around the cross or going or exploring various things that was that was the place to be.

77
00:07:57,16 --> 00:08:00,63
So some of what i was sort of more lurid. Motives.

78
00:08:00,63 --> 00:08:08,51
I think there were intellectual lines too i think that the strategy was coming out of a conservative place will be

79
00:08:08,51 --> 00:08:17,13
happy and. Through the fifty's with sort of the forty's and the strategy was. Sort of the. Gray suited.

80
00:08:17,13 --> 00:08:22,3
Short back and sides sort of society it didn't pay you to be very different. When you paid a price for it.

81
00:08:22,3 --> 00:08:27,97
So i think some of it was you know just the label instinct i guess the.

82
00:08:27,97 --> 00:08:33,94
And i think also there was i was part of the post-war baby the. I really think that.

83
00:08:33,94 --> 00:08:35,75
At that point in time not just myself

84
00:08:35,75 --> 00:08:40,65
but a lot of my contemporaries really felt that we were in a position to change things

85
00:08:40,65 --> 00:08:49,34
and change things we did with for better or worse. Is now open to question. But there was a feeling that.

86
00:08:49,34 --> 00:08:52,00
You know that you could actually stay being.

87
00:08:52,00 --> 00:09:00,03
And you could actually be powerful enough in situations to change the course of events and and. Change the directions.

88
00:09:00,23 --> 00:09:05,11
So that's i think what. What attracted me that that that. Intellectual side of it.

89
00:09:05,11 --> 00:09:07,85
And the challenge and the camaraderie.

90
00:09:07,85 --> 00:09:13,6
Of being with like minded people and that you know they were they were good times. As bad as.

91
00:09:13,6 --> 00:09:15,69
Young generations always fighting the good times

92
00:09:15,69 --> 00:09:33,44
but a lot of it was just making the most of the good times that would be had when we heard. Evolving.

93
00:09:33,44 --> 00:09:40,24
I first of all in the program from named and. I mean i guess. One of the first tenets was that.

94
00:09:40,24 --> 00:09:46,45
What we didn't want to do. We were reacting against a nine hundred seventy one.

95
00:09:46,45 --> 00:09:48,77
Aquarius festival that had been hailed on the.

96
00:09:48,77 --> 00:09:54,69
The a new campus it can but i want to say we were acting against it was actually very good very enjoyable festival.

97
00:09:54,69 --> 00:09:57,06
But it stayed very much in a traditional model.

98
00:09:57,06 --> 00:10:02,29
It was about dance companies on stage and theatre companies and theaters and. Music and holds.

99
00:10:02,89 --> 00:10:09,73
And i think very early in the piece we decided that in terms of the energy that we wanted to put into a festival.

100
00:10:09,73 --> 00:10:15,76
Before that. For the time and the place that that kind of festival. With he wasn't going to be.

101
00:10:15,76 --> 00:10:20,87
What we wanted what we were looking for something which was much more able to live to explore. Wider.

102
00:10:20,87 --> 00:10:28,06
Life styles and wider questions. So i culturally i set out to try a network.

103
00:10:28,06 --> 00:10:33,18
Which is a word that i don't think i used until perhaps years after that.

104
00:10:33,18 --> 00:10:38,7
In my role as cultural director i was constantly travelling i'd be in perth on monday in adelaide on wednesday

105
00:10:38,7 --> 00:10:44,32
and back to back to melbourne on saturday in sydney on monday again and.

106
00:10:44,32 --> 00:10:51,66
Used to travel quite a bit to graham dunstan my co-director i'm up we would often do was say arriving in adelaide for a

107
00:10:51,66 --> 00:10:55,3
weekend and saké let's take af-am books who is even this town that.

108
00:10:55,3 --> 00:11:00,41
We think is actually an interesting thing do or do what whether they run a health food restaurant

109
00:11:00,41 --> 00:11:04,38
or whether they run an alternative newspaper or whether they've got an interesting theatre group doesn't matter.

110
00:11:05,09 --> 00:11:08,91
And we would constantly. Paddies.

111
00:11:08,91 --> 00:11:12,92
I don't quite know how we manage the food and the cooking but forty people would come along.

112
00:11:12,92 --> 00:11:17,7
We'd explain that we were trying to do this gathering that was very much about exploring you

113
00:11:17,7 --> 00:11:22,95
and as a new culture is usually quite a lot of people would get up and sort of.

114
00:11:22,95 --> 00:11:29,14
You know you're still living in the sixty's man then she realized that this doesn't happen anymore and we would leave.

115
00:11:29,14 --> 00:11:33,77
And then all of the forty people would be five people sitting there saying when do we stat. Sounds great.

116
00:11:33,77 --> 00:11:38,86
What we do next. And so slowly we accumulated this sort of you and i some.

117
00:11:38,86 --> 00:11:42,82
Hundreds of people around the country who were interested in the thing and.

118
00:11:42,82 --> 00:11:48,08
Interested to the point of stopping everything else in their lives and making it total commitment. And.

119
00:11:48,08 --> 00:11:53,32
Culturally i was interested in following that through to. You know who were the people who were the instigators.

120
00:11:53,32 --> 00:11:59,57
Whether they were the musicians who were genuinely creating it in strange honor of music.

121
00:11:59,57 --> 00:12:07,45
Whether they were the theatre people who were thinking passed. In for. So there was quiet and. Work there.

122
00:12:07,45 --> 00:12:13,51
And that was by of a national network and an international network. It was national because we would draw.

123
00:12:13,74 --> 00:12:17,44
Off university circuit. Today that would be pretty limited.

124
00:12:17,44 --> 00:12:26,66
Denies days that universities into the cultures of this trade see these pretty deeply sad that the few thousand people

125
00:12:26,66 --> 00:12:32,95
ultimately that were part of that great fight probably did represent an interesting think tank of people in australia.

126
00:12:32,95 --> 00:12:38,32
And then there was an international network which was which would simply.

127
00:12:38,32 --> 00:12:43,72
Come about by every time i heard of some interesting organizational performer overseas that seemed in tune with name

128
00:12:43,72 --> 00:12:50,48
and i would write them a letter of this massive bank of correspondence. Basically again.

129
00:12:50,48 --> 00:12:53,16
Simply saying what we're doing inviting them out of that.

130
00:12:53,16 --> 00:12:58,86
And then sort of you know talking to funding bodies like the straight a cancer let's say to the say what assistance we

131
00:12:58,86 --> 00:13:05,28
could line up. So. And that was all very much on the basis of. What i guess i would call tribal cultures.

132
00:13:05,28 --> 00:13:12,05
Whether they were people coming from tribal cultures such as africa and india that were literally still living.

133
00:13:12,98 --> 00:13:19,02
Samy tribal lifestyle. Or whether it was the tribes of the philly parties and they were from paris they were you know.

134
00:13:19,02 --> 00:13:25,55
Which is part of this global counterculture. But we gradually attracted quite a few people.

135
00:13:25,55 --> 00:13:29,28
Some of whom we actually managed to organize the tickets or phase four

136
00:13:29,28 --> 00:13:34,55
and sort of in a came say me officially others who just had heard about a dinner

137
00:13:34,55 --> 00:13:36,05
and sort of thought it sounded interesting

138
00:13:36,05 --> 00:13:39,77
and i would bit of a loose rein so they started making their way to a strata.

139
00:13:39,77 --> 00:13:45,16
It was actually quite an interesting to me to mean in the three months leading up to me.

140
00:13:45,16 --> 00:13:51,59
They would have been out of that tree. Three five hundred people living up there and working around the clock on.

141
00:13:51,59 --> 00:13:57,09
Building toilets. You know. All can izing food chains and such with id.

142
00:13:57,09 --> 00:14:01,45
Family people going to turn up to the festival in the i mean it could have been sort of in a couple of bass

143
00:14:01,45 --> 00:14:07,59
and it could have been fifty thousand new of us and i one was rolling in advance or sending you know.

144
00:14:07,59 --> 00:14:13,51
The same thing in their entry. All of which made. This trade union students rather nervous.

145
00:14:13,96 --> 00:14:20,54
I think graham and i would say the admin the book probably going to destroy the union forever.

146
00:14:20,54 --> 00:14:27,31
And every time we turn around there be another knife in the backside to speak. But it did give rise to this sort of.

147
00:14:28,85 --> 00:14:30,75
My guess is that something.

148
00:14:30,75 --> 00:14:33,78
Something between ten and fifteen thousand people finally came through

149
00:14:33,78 --> 00:14:40,25
and we did manage to you know to organize the food the food chains in the first state it's safe to say that.

150
00:14:40,25 --> 00:14:49,55
Nobody stabbed nobody died and. It was a fairly interesting gathering. And one where. I think what was unique about it.

151
00:14:49,55 --> 00:14:57,33
And what came out of that whole process as i think everyone approached it not so much in terms of coming to a festival

152
00:14:57,33 --> 00:15:00,04
to be entertained. Everyone to paste it the other way around.

153
00:15:00,04 --> 00:15:05,51
We're coming to make it happen we keep saying this new program you're the program. What are you going to do.

154
00:15:05,51 --> 00:15:09,34
And people came with that attitude. I mean in a remarkable way.

155
00:15:09,34 --> 00:15:14,73
And some people whom we've had long communication with and others we've never heard of i mean this sort of.

156
00:15:14,73 --> 00:15:16,25
Entire kind of ten

157
00:15:16,25 --> 00:15:21,88
or twelve place theater group from new zealand called blurted turned up in this wonderful bus that was the real.

158
00:15:21,88 --> 00:15:24,99
Sort of magical mystery tour and just turned up and said. We're here.

159
00:15:24,99 --> 00:15:33,88
You know we're here where we perform live where we live. So lots of people came in that sort of spirit. Very much.

160
00:15:33,88 --> 00:15:40,57
Remember us using. Using phrases like you know what you eat and whatever the whole the whole line was that.

161
00:15:40,57 --> 00:15:49,5
This is a festival it's about culture in the widest sense. It's not about just. Bans on stages. It's about the.

162
00:15:49,5 --> 00:15:56,22
Create giving space. It's about the after cooking meal it's about all about seeing this.

163
00:15:56,22 --> 00:16:03,14
It was a very remarkable campsite was all i'll say.

164
00:16:03,14 --> 00:16:11,5
Of people camped outside this small isolated country to add with some of the weirdest and most wonderful.

165
00:16:11,5 --> 00:16:19,22
Structures and. Performances there were people in tree. They were people that sort of the. Elaborate.

166
00:16:19,22 --> 00:16:28,25
People had sort of you know. I was in the ground people. And i mean part of the the joy of the thing.

167
00:16:28,25 --> 00:16:35,33
I think was so i was wondering around this. Bit of a magical mystery land of all of these things.

168
00:16:35,33 --> 00:16:36,95
And just in countering.

169
00:16:37,39 --> 00:16:44,12
You really did have the feeling that you didn't need to get to the stage to be entertained hell thing was made the time.

170
00:16:44,12 --> 00:16:47,43
And the fact that there were some people in there who. I mean you know.

171
00:16:47,43 --> 00:16:52,84
An interesting example i think is for the party we've heard about on the grapevine and.

172
00:16:52,84 --> 00:16:55,98
Managed to organize a fee from the astray to cancel lisa.

173
00:16:55,98 --> 00:17:02,48
I think he's the blonde and this generation he was the most extraordinary man in terms of balance

174
00:17:02,48 --> 00:17:07,53
and physical feats that other than it came to the man with a knife.

175
00:17:07,53 --> 00:17:07,7
With

176
00:17:07,7 --> 00:17:14,82
and if it is lighter he was paid a million dollars to walk between the twin towers of the financial district in new york.

177
00:17:14,82 --> 00:17:18,42
And when the festool sidney tried to invite him back to a strategy for the bus

178
00:17:18,42 --> 00:17:20,45
and nine hundred eighty eight they couldn't afford him.

179
00:17:21,48 --> 00:17:27,63
You know they were people of that caliber of people who you know. On a world level i think are remarkable figures.

180
00:17:27,63 --> 00:17:28,34
And then.

181
00:17:28,34 --> 00:17:33,59
You know many people who give up and give a wonderful performance he'd never heard of before and never would again.

182
00:17:34,13 --> 00:17:39,3
All of which i think was manifesting a little bit the spirit at the festival which stayed that sort of you know.

183
00:17:39,3 --> 00:17:45,83
We had it with all of us. I mean we live in a society that makes. Special things about of that. And some people into.

184
00:17:45,83 --> 00:17:58,51
But basically. You know. We're latticed inside where either when the true artist life. Wouldn't mind.

185
00:17:58,51 --> 00:18:05,77
Talking about one more powerful than that of the. Another. And i have a.

186
00:18:05,77 --> 00:18:11,63
I think very interesting perform of that that we invited. And it was again part of this networking process.

187
00:18:11,63 --> 00:18:19,33
Was an amazing african. Musician. Called dollar brand. And the make an ism by which. Dollar arrived to.

188
00:18:19,33 --> 00:18:19,73
That name

189
00:18:19,73 --> 00:18:25,9
and i think was interesting because it says something about this networking process through all ways in different

190
00:18:25,9 --> 00:18:30,12
cities that i mean. We eventually sort of.

191
00:18:30,12 --> 00:18:34,33
Kimi and i had quite a large number of people who weren't on the payroll and had no title

192
00:18:34,33 --> 00:18:39,86
but it was just time to stook that but they were doing was working full time. But. Been investable.

193
00:18:39,86 --> 00:18:45,63
And one of the it was very interesting a south african. Called bastogne.

194
00:18:45,63 --> 00:18:51,88
Who knew african culture fairly well and knew a strategy an alternative culture.

195
00:18:51,88 --> 00:18:58,59
And he was determined to being what he thought was so my significant. Musical figure. Of his country which is.

196
00:18:58,59 --> 00:19:05,43
Dollar brand. We did actually again. Manage to get some assistance of insulation these two very cancel fleece.

197
00:19:05,43 --> 00:19:12,78
And he was the person that yes. It was a nice wonderful blade. I think of traditional african music and modern jazz.

198
00:19:12,78 --> 00:19:27,41
In fact he divided his life between the land. And the new zealand. So again. One of the wonderful examples of of.

199
00:19:27,41 --> 00:19:32,01
Someone who came to the festival. And came uniquely in. Unique way.

200
00:19:32,01 --> 00:19:37,68
And there's just one more i'd like to touch on i mean mine could probably go on for an hour just to me amazing

201
00:19:37,68 --> 00:19:38,3
performance.

202
00:19:38,3 --> 00:19:46,01
Spend up at nieman but this is the one that that i think for me was they spelt the whole thing out of us

203
00:19:46,01 --> 00:19:55,48
and it was a group that arrived very late in the festival and their arrival was. It was way special for me.

204
00:19:55,48 --> 00:20:03,32
There was an incident. Halfway through the festival. Someone was alleged to of been paid ling had drugs into of.

205
00:20:03,32 --> 00:20:10,14
There was a story about rape or whatever all of which ultimately turned out to be fiction. I think.

206
00:20:10,14 --> 00:20:19,5
Spinning off the idea that. Any minute. It happened. Very soon after the election of the with the government.

207
00:20:19,5 --> 00:20:25,87
Coming to power and seventy three. And seventy two sorry. And in the seventy's.

208
00:20:25,87 --> 00:20:32,01
And a spot of that with them government coming to power it had been a pretty strong coalition between the student

209
00:20:32,01 --> 00:20:35,95
movement and the union movement and.

210
00:20:35,95 --> 00:20:46,05
Allowed to be aware of it i think there were a lot of forces they had the per interested in. Nimbin being discredited.

211
00:20:46,05 --> 00:20:51,84
Not for anything that had anything to do with us and what we were doing really. But because of that political context.

212
00:20:52,98 --> 00:20:57,48
I mean for all we could figure out this this surprise. Dragon said was in fact a set up.

213
00:20:57,48 --> 00:21:00,8
But what it resulted in was the twenty first quite coming up from sydney.

214
00:21:00,8 --> 00:21:05,61
The whole of nimbin sort of you know forwarding into sort of. Two armed camps.

215
00:21:05,61 --> 00:21:12,14
Leftist radicals on one side and on the twenty first's squad on the other and then sort of.

216
00:21:12,14 --> 00:21:17,26
Lot of lot of people sitting in the middle saying hang on we messed up and made a tidal wave through it

217
00:21:17,26 --> 00:21:25,02
and leave it to the point where the ad really took our i mean the whole festival became about this incident.

218
00:21:25,02 --> 00:21:27,99
And that was blown out of all proportion.

219
00:21:27,99 --> 00:21:32,69
And i didn't cut quite know what to do about it at the time except to proceed with.

220
00:21:32,69 --> 00:21:39,99
You know trying to bring the last of these these. Which was a group from from india called the bowels of bain goal.

221
00:21:40,5 --> 00:21:45,42
And the bows were quite unique in that. One of the eldest musical traditions on the.

222
00:21:45,42 --> 00:21:49,68
They go back to previous times in india. And.

223
00:21:49,68 --> 00:21:57,37
What they traditionally were leaving galli countryside was the gypsies and the seeds being is even to this day

224
00:21:57,37 --> 00:22:01,31
when the bowels arrive in a village in india and dance tools.

225
00:22:01,31 --> 00:22:07,02
And there's a great paddy's haled neighbor and comes to this and actually seen you. The news of the day.

226
00:22:07,02 --> 00:22:13,51
And this was a tradition that i've gone. You know thousands of these. We had got to the plate for i had.

227
00:22:13,61 --> 00:22:23,92
The most famous by the day. Sitting in calcutta ready to. I managed to raise the face for them to come.

228
00:22:23,92 --> 00:22:29,47
But i had no visas and no way of getting them there and outside in the fields. You know.

229
00:22:29,47 --> 00:22:37,2
I really was at the point where it could have fled into riots. So i hopped on a plane went down to canberra.

230
00:22:37,2 --> 00:22:45,91
But never made him before but sort of. Knocked on the door and. And straight into to visit dr h. C.

231
00:22:45,91 --> 00:22:50,88
Rather remarkable gentleman who had sort of stayed up the straight he counseled and.

232
00:22:50,88 --> 00:22:55,3
Been almost single handedly responsible for post-war reconstruction in the state after the war

233
00:22:55,3 --> 00:23:01,18
and at that stage was head of the reserve bank and a very powerful and influential man in canberra.

234
00:23:01,73 --> 00:23:06,41
So i walked into his office he's sitting up there with this huge absolutely clean mahogany desk

235
00:23:06,41 --> 00:23:13,55
and on the table in they knew who i was but that was all. On the desk in front of a b. Had the local afternoon.

236
00:23:13,55 --> 00:23:16,44
That they had lied that we had something like sort of.

237
00:23:16,44 --> 00:23:24,8
Ten thousand and students riot police beaten and was absolutely sensational a spacer got a name and.

238
00:23:24,8 --> 00:23:29,38
So he just he just looked at me. Looked at the paper. And said what do you want.

239
00:23:30,17 --> 00:23:34,67
And i started to burble out that i've got basics people sitting at home and i'm trying.

240
00:23:35,31 --> 00:23:41,08
So i just picked up the facts and immigration and.

241
00:23:41,68 --> 00:23:54,42
I went back on here plane back than in been managed to get these people into. The name and by the by the next day and.

242
00:23:54,42 --> 00:23:58,64
Coincidentally arrived at the naman festival. At the height of the full moon.

243
00:23:58,64 --> 00:24:01,91
And at the height of all this drama that had been going on

244
00:24:01,91 --> 00:24:06,91
and the first performance was to get up in the eighth the full moon and just seeing this absolutely.

245
00:24:07,91 --> 00:24:13,51
If you've ever heard the music it's some of the most lyrical and beautiful music. You hope to hear. And for.

246
00:24:13,61 --> 00:24:16,26
Me personally it was just a resolution of the whole thing.

247
00:24:16,26 --> 00:24:20,6
And then the next day for whatever reason all of that conflict had been resolved.

248
00:24:20,6 --> 00:24:24,52
We never did actually quite get to the bottom of what the drug bust in the set up was all about

249
00:24:24,52 --> 00:24:26,79
but anyway it all went away.

250
00:24:26,79 --> 00:24:34,62
Paper went back to the same feeling of peace and cooperation

251
00:24:34,62 --> 00:24:38,42
and whatever that the festival had started with then in my mind that.

252
00:24:38,42 --> 00:24:44,05
That magical concert under that full moon with the bowels of bengal will always be one of the things that.

253
00:24:44,05 --> 00:24:56,73
For me personally the festival worthwhile. I guess the other one was finally coming down to sydney and before he left.

254
00:24:56,73 --> 00:25:00,69
Walking between the two pilots of. The sydney. Have a beach.

255
00:25:00,69 --> 00:25:06,21
Illegally i might add while he was doing at their place been down the bottom trying to get the guy with guy wires

256
00:25:06,21 --> 00:25:09,39
and i saying well if you do that will be manslaughter and then saying well.

257
00:25:09,39 --> 00:25:14,52
Since he said if he comes down he's going straight into a paddy wagon. But all that aside.

258
00:25:15,3 --> 00:25:19,49
He did manage to win this being the person that he was the challenge

259
00:25:19,49 --> 00:25:25,76
and having to a strategy was to walk between the parlance of the how to be right around the world.

260
00:25:25,76 --> 00:25:31,76
And in fact i mean the maton chappie. Into it with a vital few weeks i can say.

261
00:25:31,76 --> 00:25:39,18
The spirit of new conquers the spirit of the industrial revolution and. So they were i mean in a way.

262
00:25:39,18 --> 00:25:47,72
I being at that story because it illustrates i think one of the things about the name and that's been forgotten.

263
00:25:47,72 --> 00:25:58,31
Since that name been. Infiltrated in many many different. Name and for me. It was never jest. Never just the place.

264
00:25:58,31 --> 00:26:03,3
Was never just a country town and the south wales and it was never just a festival of.

265
00:26:03,3 --> 00:26:09,7
Fifteen thousand people gathering for ten days from a name and was always at an id and the mint

266
00:26:09,7 --> 00:26:13,51
and a group of friends and many other things.

267
00:26:14,26 --> 00:26:22,61
That grew out of a certain cultural conditioning the strategy that was quite unique was lucky enough to manifest that

268
00:26:22,61 --> 00:26:24,26
and to express it at a time.

269
00:26:24,77 --> 00:26:31,76
And then i think it was and then went again some people remained physically human and made that they heard.

270
00:26:31,76 --> 00:26:38,61
Other people talk that name an experience or camaraderie. Or spirit or whatever you might want to call it.

271
00:26:38,61 --> 00:26:45,18
And took that back to the universities all the health food restaurants all day musical bands or whatever.

272
00:26:45,18 --> 00:26:46,77
And i think for some years they

273
00:26:46,77 --> 00:26:51,47
and there was a certain kind of recognition of people that shape out of that experience

274
00:26:51,47 --> 00:26:54,29
when they would meet there'd be a certain.

275
00:26:54,29 --> 00:26:57,83
Recognition a certain common ground that they had shared this experience that.

276
00:26:57,83 --> 00:27:04,22
It was really a lot more than just a terrible thing is it's become something else now.

277
00:27:05,7 --> 00:27:08,02
I remember that in the few years after the name

278
00:27:08,02 --> 00:27:15,52
and wasn't very respectable i mean the cost of all this kind of tabloid press headlines about the drug raid it said.

279
00:27:15,52 --> 00:27:17,74
It wasn't very respectable and.

280
00:27:17,74 --> 00:27:22,23
My mother i mean i've never used to tell people that i've been involved in a big festival she would always sort of

281
00:27:22,23 --> 00:27:30,1
explain some of the way until the women's weekly started running two page kind of photo stories on alternative

282
00:27:30,1 --> 00:27:34,67
lifestyles of name and. And then my mother suddenly became very interested in telling. When i was in trains that.

283
00:27:34,67 --> 00:27:37,88
You know that. Johnny had been involved in this thing.

284
00:27:38,02 --> 00:27:45,51
So i think it went through many different changes for a long while i mean you know that the sydney morning herald was

285
00:27:45,51 --> 00:27:51,45
running sort of regular features i have to name and walk around the university so it's all kind of.

286
00:27:52,27 --> 00:27:57,79
Discussion of the name and what which said something about the significance that that event

287
00:27:57,79 --> 00:28:03,83
and being in in the lives of lots of people. But it came then in journalistic. I think.

288
00:28:03,83 --> 00:28:10,14
To represent a rather handy shorthand for alternatives hippies drugs all of those things.

289
00:28:10,14 --> 00:28:20,12
So that i think now when im been dragged out sometimes. This is not a light up by this program. But when human is.

290
00:28:20,12 --> 00:28:25,32
Dragged out now it's quite often dragged out as a shorthand for first a certain set of things.

291
00:28:25,32 --> 00:28:32,14
Which is not a fait a name of a fate of the things that it represented. Because as i say i think that.

292
00:28:32,14 --> 00:28:38,7
To really try and add up what newman was to say many different people would be very i mean i live.

293
00:28:38,7 --> 00:28:45,84
Very closely through the whole thing and i couldn't easily put into words what newman was the you know he's now.

294
00:28:45,84 --> 00:28:49,73
And once you try and reduce those scenes to sort of tabloid simplicity.

295
00:28:49,73 --> 00:28:54,02
You either missed the point or you simplify the point. Beyond recognition. But.

296
00:28:54,02 --> 00:29:00,54
I think the thing that came out of it for me was that it was a gathering that brought together a lot of creative

297
00:29:00,54 --> 00:29:08,27
and important strands and then at the other end. By the same strains way out again. But they went out.

298
00:29:08,27 --> 00:29:15,48
Reinvigorated and strengthened by the sort of dialogue and. The sort of prices that newman was.

299
00:29:15,48 --> 00:29:26,08
So in many ways it was it was what one would hype. A festival a celebration. Is in a society and. For me personally.

300
00:29:26,08 --> 00:29:34,35
That's what i picked up on. I mean. The last twenty years for me as being not spent being an alternative.

301
00:29:34,35 --> 00:29:41,2
Society person or whatever name and the last twenty years for me it's been exploring that potential.

302
00:29:41,2 --> 00:29:46,48
What is the role of celebration. What is the role of. Community events.

303
00:29:46,48 --> 00:29:52,29
Leading into what i now do which is a manager for hybrid seed new running.

304
00:29:52,29 --> 00:29:56,33
Hundreds of projects a year and doing a festival every weekend.

305
00:29:56,33 --> 00:30:01,77
And looking back i have in my life i've been in the been a few experiences that i've had that.

306
00:30:01,77 --> 00:30:08,72
That's that sort of social process that. That was named and i think the bicentenary in the strategy was one quote.

307
00:30:08,72 --> 00:30:13,51
Very different of it. A different involvement very different coloring. But i think that.

308
00:30:13,55 --> 00:30:18,7
You can almost talk about the strategy before the bicentenary in a straight after the bus and train me.

309
00:30:18,7 --> 00:30:24,72
In terms of what that means is a bit of a cultural watershed in terms of a straight his identity.

310
00:30:24,72 --> 00:30:28,68
And in terms of the way we. We think about time and i think that.

311
00:30:28,68 --> 00:30:33,37
And just as it's taken decades to work out and human and will take many more.

312
00:30:33,37 --> 00:30:35,97
I think it'll take a couple of decades to work out.

313
00:30:35,97 --> 00:30:42,69
The vice internet think all the talk now all of the strategy of becoming a republican the increased awareness of

314
00:30:42,69 --> 00:30:43,59
aboriginal culture

315
00:30:43,59 --> 00:30:51,34
and how white australia sits with its its that so its aboriginal past its i think goal of bias things out.

316
00:30:51,34 --> 00:30:58,23
Top and possehl and. And that's what i what i what i what i mean by.

317
00:30:58,23 --> 00:31:03,36
Celebration and celebration has or has in my mind always i have a tie and it's about very date.

318
00:31:05,05 --> 00:31:11,18
Currents and cultural thinking. And society at my appeared to be just about. Lots of people sort of you know.

319
00:31:11,18 --> 00:31:15,23
Going out in one day and having a good time. But if it's genuine celebration.

320
00:31:15,23 --> 00:31:25,51
To me it's a very profound thing that has all the waves of change and. Always reflections to it is.

321
00:31:29,89 --> 00:31:39,55
It's interesting to think back and speculate on where way society's got to when people die and use the fry.

322
00:31:39,55 --> 00:31:49,52
For example have been hood fyi is the price cap the culture or even alternative society too much anymore and i think.

323
00:31:49,52 --> 00:32:00,66
What's tended to happen is as a lot of the insights of that period. That they'd taken on board. By the why the society.

324
00:32:00,66 --> 00:32:04,43
I mentioned earlier for example that. Nine hundred seventy.

325
00:32:04,43 --> 00:32:13,51
To talk about how to talk about the greenhouse effect at such and the for many years said been. And scientists.

326
00:32:13,74 --> 00:32:19,82
And environmentalist who are aware of all those things and. You know that certain levels of common knowledge.

327
00:32:19,82 --> 00:32:22,11
But in terms of the population in general.

328
00:32:22,11 --> 00:32:26,1
If you talk about those things you're either mad or you have complete medical.

329
00:32:26,1 --> 00:32:31,73
It's been interesting to say what's happened in the last twenty years i mean society has absorbed so many of their sins

330
00:32:31,73 --> 00:32:33,2
they've absorbed the straight mole.

331
00:32:33,2 --> 00:32:38,52
I think people now realize that it's not complete madness to talk about greenhouse effect that's it for the something

332
00:32:38,52 --> 00:32:46,63
that could be very real and could be just around the corner. And people of all sides sort of. Absorbed.

333
00:32:46,63 --> 00:32:49,5
Some of the solutions and i think that.

334
00:32:49,5 --> 00:32:56,57
Right across the board i think the environment has a place in papal sinking now which.

335
00:32:56,57 --> 00:32:59,6
Radically different to that which you did twenty years ago.

336
00:33:00,22 --> 00:33:05,86
And that is reflected as it has to be in very sort of fire and life style wise

337
00:33:05,86 --> 00:33:11,17
and environment isn't isn't just about sort of. The make it picture.

338
00:33:11,17 --> 00:33:16,78
It's about what you do with the rubbish and you recycle things and. What you do with your life.

339
00:33:16,78 --> 00:33:22,42
And if it's not probably in trouble. I mean i remember. We were leaving.

340
00:33:22,42 --> 00:33:28,46
Leaving new york on one visit to new york in this wonderful piece of graffiti. Outside kennedy airport.

341
00:33:28,46 --> 00:33:34,99
Just as i was leaving new york that said. A college the last fad. And that scared me.

342
00:33:34,99 --> 00:33:39,97
I mean if if if if we do manage to let these things like ecology

343
00:33:39,97 --> 00:33:45,97
and the environment etc remain just kind of fashionable fête issues then. The future is very bleak indeed.

344
00:33:45,97 --> 00:33:49,45
So i think that society is.

345
00:33:49,45 --> 00:33:55,14
It has absorbed nice to that sings the question i think that we're all trying to resolve is that once absorbed.

346
00:33:55,14 --> 00:33:58,59
It's absorbed all those things are there any solutions you know.

347
00:33:58,59 --> 00:34:04,44
Can we arrive at a sustainable future and solve some of that sings. The dilemmas are enormous.

348
00:34:04,44 --> 00:34:13,06
I mean i think we've got one part of the industrial first world sort of you know busily now trying to i'm trying to

349
00:34:13,06 --> 00:34:18,76
shed some. Worst excesses and with the same time we've got many parts of the third world desperate.

350
00:34:18,76 --> 00:34:24,33
To do all that consuming that there will always been the not so you've got the current scouting in both directions at

351
00:34:24,33 --> 00:34:27,92
once. And the problems are enormous at the same time.

352
00:34:27,92 --> 00:34:37,17
I think human ingenuity is enormous and i mean some of my from that time. And i think always will remain.

353
00:34:37,17 --> 00:34:42,67
The buckminster fuller's and people like that who take all that on board and set up their ass. Solutions.

354
00:34:42,67 --> 00:34:53,48
It's a question of us becoming an awful and thoughtful and i have to work that's true. And i don't know i mean.

355
00:34:53,48 --> 00:35:01,3
I think i probably see it on a little bit of the fence with all of that where we can debate another twenty.

356
00:35:01,3 --> 00:35:05,35
Is whether we can do it with some of the racing strudel whether we're going to keep.

357
00:35:05,35 --> 00:35:11,44
Plunging headlong down to oblivion. I don't think anyone can say. I think we all know.

358
00:35:11,44 --> 00:35:16,44
I would put the issues that we love. But some of the choices but it's not simple.

359
00:35:16,44 --> 00:35:22,23
It's tempting to sit back and say well you know. Finally i give you the family people would do blah blah blah.

360
00:35:22,77 --> 00:35:30,64
That's not the way works. It's going to be a sort of a long and and and and the sly with the gradual working through.

361
00:35:30,64 --> 00:35:37,84
So many of the signs of positives that the problems and the moments and.

362
00:35:37,84 --> 00:35:43,12
I don't think it will be in my lifetime that we reach a resolution of that i think that it's something that will carry

363
00:35:43,12 --> 00:35:51,22
well into the twenty first century and. Another generation will be grappling with the long before. Long after a.

364
00:35:51,22 --> 00:36:16,51
Shuffled off to a more peaceful existence somewhere else. In terms of have that sort of celebration.

365
00:36:16,51 --> 00:36:23,25
And impulsive and in the news. Has made its way into. The larger population i think it's easy to concede a again.

366
00:36:23,99 --> 00:36:29,28
An issue. Believe through and remember accurately the strategy of the fifty's.

367
00:36:29,83 --> 00:36:35,53
It is fairly hard to realize the difference between the looseness and the freedom in the collar

368
00:36:35,53 --> 00:36:41,85
and whatever the existing nasa citing now that the didn't twenty and thirty six i mean even just i mean but

369
00:36:41,85 --> 00:36:48,5
when you saw right. When you saw a mile in a colorful shit. It was unusual and you turned and looked twice.

370
00:36:48,5 --> 00:36:51,07
Now you walk through any any sort of.

371
00:36:51,07 --> 00:36:58,69
Any shop in town and the sort of you know about that whole area of design and whatever's influenced out.

372
00:36:58,69 --> 00:37:02,24
Fashions and i had to live to an extraordinary extent.

373
00:37:02,24 --> 00:37:07,94
And to an extent that's mainly positive it's also influenced i think very much.

374
00:37:07,94 --> 00:37:15,15
Our ability to celebrate and thoughts and celebration i think it's. It's so loose a culture. One of the things that.

375
00:37:15,15 --> 00:37:25,02
But that i've always been deeply involved in is that we live in a you're paying what was a european cultural outpost in

376
00:37:25,02 --> 00:37:37,27
southeast asia. And what we did in the first century in trade court is whatever it was was. Simply import your pain.

377
00:37:37,27 --> 00:37:42,13
Culture into a striving in that largely into a culture that we have of concert halls

378
00:37:42,13 --> 00:37:48,68
and theaters it's which are something that was devised in the european environment and came out of that environment

379
00:37:48,68 --> 00:37:53,28
and suited that environment. We live in a color climate of course you want to go indoors.

380
00:37:53,71 --> 00:38:01,09
I think the challenge in a strategy is to develop a culture that comes out of this giant which is a type a different

381
00:38:01,09 --> 00:38:05,2
one where a much warmer subtropical. Culture.

382
00:38:05,2 --> 00:38:10,52
We have very much an outdoor culture so the sort of the sort of cultural experiences and events.

383
00:38:10,6 --> 00:38:19,33
Sort of always interested in aptos celebrations and outdoor events. For two reasons first of all i think that sort of.

384
00:38:19,33 --> 00:38:25,72
He's much more explorative of the strategy and. Condition and it's much more you know. What's unique about australia.

385
00:38:25,72 --> 00:38:29,14
And say can be because i can be more sociable.

386
00:38:29,14 --> 00:38:36,61
I think that people do touch shoulders in the hundreds and in the absence of a valuable events and.

387
00:38:36,61 --> 00:38:41,31
I don't think i'm a line in that i think that they are right across the street in society this being in the.

388
00:38:41,31 --> 00:38:48,42
In that direction. I mean the whole. There's a whole. Of instant celebrations movement.

389
00:38:48,42 --> 00:38:54,57
Industry in australia now that it wasn't. Twenty six. I mean they couldn't have been a bison tainui again.

390
00:38:55,05 --> 00:39:01,84
And that's changed i think the way people act when i'm out of a vote the way they think.

391
00:39:01,84 --> 00:39:12,22
Again it's one of these things that you've got to take along to ask why. Why are people wanting his experiences.

392
00:39:12,22 --> 00:39:18,86
And how is it changing the nature of the culture. And i think there are pros and cons to it i think that.

393
00:39:18,86 --> 00:39:25,59
Increasingly we exist in a culture way and i spadeful. That we like to their neighbors or even their families.

394
00:39:25,59 --> 00:39:27,5
Perhaps as much as they did.

395
00:39:27,5 --> 00:39:31,78
Twenty and thirty years ago we tend to see it in a room

396
00:39:31,78 --> 00:39:39,37
and spend many hours a day watching this little square box called television. And we relate to the world. Very much.

397
00:39:39,37 --> 00:39:45,07
Electronically and. The motive. And if you get to los angeles you'll see this taken to extremes.

398
00:39:45,07 --> 00:39:52,24
And i think that's produced a civilization where people just don't touch. One another in flesh and blood.

399
00:39:52,24 --> 00:39:53,84
Much the way they used to.

400
00:39:53,84 --> 00:39:59,1
When the cultural of the way into the way was going out to a movie theater or at least rubbing shoulders in the crowd.

401
00:39:59,1 --> 00:40:06,82
Well going out to the saturday night dance. We do believe in a more kind of. Technologically isolated and.

402
00:40:06,82 --> 00:40:12,6
Boxed in sort of society. And i think that. One of the responses to. That is paying for people to want.

403
00:40:12,6 --> 00:40:16,36
The experience of going out and being part of a large crowds.

404
00:40:16,5 --> 00:40:21,74
I think that if we could shoot fifty years into the future somewhere into the sort of you know.

405
00:40:21,74 --> 00:40:30,8
The year two thousand and forty or whatever and look back on the eighty's and ninety's i think the the unique

406
00:40:30,8 --> 00:40:36,87
and the important cultural events will be that it's mass. People against it so all the sort of you know.

407
00:40:36,87 --> 00:40:46,62
The ly concepts and. Bicentenary s. and Little ships so well by scenes i think cite something about.

408
00:40:46,62 --> 00:40:50,98
This period in time and what's unique about the culture of this period of time. I guess.

409
00:40:50,98 --> 00:40:57,31
I mean i tend to think about a lot about that because that's the look i do. I'm involved by choice in creating.

410
00:40:57,31 --> 00:41:02,43
Community celebrations and whether that's a celebration for fifty or two hundred people

411
00:41:02,43 --> 00:41:09,06
or whether that's a celebration for a hundred thousand people to me making these and. The ones the sign.

412
00:41:09,24 --> 00:41:11,24
But i do observe that that.

413
00:41:11,24 --> 00:41:17,03
You know that people seem to want that experience effect that you can get one hundred thousand people to come out for

414
00:41:17,03 --> 00:41:22,13
and strike a diet dialing or whatever it is says something about the need for that.

415
00:41:22,13 --> 00:41:28,68
And so i think says says a lot about where we're trying to find. Tribal society again.

416
00:41:28,97 --> 00:41:33,35
Some of us are finding it by going off and living in small groups an alternative.

417
00:41:33,35 --> 00:41:42,55
Situation some of us of finding it by living inside the wider than dice culture but trying to find ways of.

418
00:41:42,55 --> 00:41:49,78
Great connecting. By celebrations. And i'm glad we're doing it that way because it strikes me that time.

419
00:41:49,78 --> 00:41:53,25
Societies and the same to break down the lies beyond reason

420
00:41:53,25 --> 00:42:02,46
and work together in a hugely cooperative way for one of two reasons. That happens and warren's response to the threat.

421
00:42:02,46 --> 00:42:05,82
And it happens in pace time when there is a cause for celebration.

422
00:42:06,28 --> 00:42:28,36
And i know which one of those motivations i've done the work of. If you had to try and sum up the queries festival.

423
00:42:28,36 --> 00:42:35,48
Deals behind that. I'd say that. The first one was probably the exploration of alternatives. The feeling that.

424
00:42:35,48 --> 00:42:37,35
That we would be ching danes

425
00:42:37,35 --> 00:42:44,89
and that in a state of in a state of crisis such as i think would probably be a name of subjugating for saddam get used

426
00:42:44,89 --> 00:42:54,71
to it now. It's society in a state of environmental crisis and social crisis in many ways. I think at that is times.

427
00:42:55,23 --> 00:43:01,03
The thing that you do is explore right joel tennant of something you find new ways and talk with us.

428
00:43:01,03 --> 00:43:10,01
So i think in terms of the spirit of nimbin the thing which would stand up for me most would be that that a lot of

429
00:43:10,01 --> 00:43:20,75
exploring alternatives with us as i said with a kind of cultural tenant of soul or building alternatives

430
00:43:20,75 --> 00:43:26,06
or food alternatives or. Healing alternatives it doesn't matter.

431
00:43:26,06 --> 00:43:32,54
And sort of you know approach to that was a very very wide one. They were and they needed lines.

432
00:43:32,54 --> 00:43:39,48
It wasn't about this new religion or theory or that line it was just about exploring alternatives

433
00:43:39,48 --> 00:43:45,94
and was about the to explore the whole. Then the second one would be and they sound like funny words now because like.

434
00:43:45,94 --> 00:43:53,19
When that itself to be and i have a used to say many times that that the woods had to know what the words. Now mean.

435
00:43:53,6 --> 00:44:00,9
But there was a very tangible. Spirit of cooperation and brotherhood.

436
00:44:00,9 --> 00:44:01,89
Togetherness they with name

437
00:44:01,89 --> 00:44:06,9
and that certainly being fairly unique to me i haven't experienced that many times in my life

438
00:44:06,9 --> 00:44:13,69
and i've never experienced it as strongly. History that experience. Why that should be sad.

439
00:44:13,69 --> 00:44:19,08
I'm not quite sure but i think it has a lot to do with when people are working together.

440
00:44:19,08 --> 00:44:22,21
Toward some sort of common cause and that.

441
00:44:22,29 --> 00:44:29,42
It does create a real brotherhood it creates an intellectual affinity and it creates a sort of national input thing

442
00:44:29,42 --> 00:44:33,47
and well if i sings that. Coming out in words like pace and love.

443
00:44:33,47 --> 00:44:39,07
But actually manifest themselves in situations that work. And.

444
00:44:39,07 --> 00:44:49,28
And then i guess the third one to me would be a sort of a cultural cultural dimension that i think.

445
00:44:50,19 --> 00:44:59,76
Did find new ways in terms of a straight in culture. In many different directions and by culture i do mean.

446
00:44:59,76 --> 00:45:06,71
Fairly widely and. I'm talking about sort of you know. Music and theater and i'm also talking much more widely.

447
00:45:06,71 --> 00:45:13,62
I'm talking about the sort of the way. Culture manifests itself. Right across our lives in sort of you know.

448
00:45:13,62 --> 00:45:16,43
In how we light. We dress how we build our hands.

449
00:45:17,08 --> 00:45:23,29
I think that to me it was a cultural watershed is the way in which i could express that it probably was a little bit

450
00:45:23,29 --> 00:45:30,76
the culmination all of in many ways alignment happened in seventy three in many ways it sort of belongs in the sixty's.

451
00:45:30,76 --> 00:45:39,54
Of some of the critics were right. But in many ways it was kind of brought i think to a head.

452
00:45:39,54 --> 00:45:43,3
That price war straight in period where. I think that.

453
00:45:43,3 --> 00:45:49,65
After the war that people didn't have much choice but to put their heads down and rebuild. And it did sort of you know.

454
00:45:49,65 --> 00:45:57,13
Create a very conservative period and i think. Newman was a bit of a watershed where that came to an end.

455
00:45:57,13 --> 00:46:00,4
And it read a bit of a why it has to do with the baby boom

456
00:46:00,4 --> 00:46:06,57
and all that sort of things as well read a bit of a life that i think he can talk about before and even then and and.

457
00:46:06,57 --> 00:46:14,29
And allow it's very hard to put into words i think that there was a certain sort of cultural change that around the

458
00:46:14,29 --> 00:46:20,01
type that had to do with the with the government coming to power. Many other elias as well but i think from.

459
00:46:20,01 --> 00:46:27,63
Around that point. The strategy started. To see itself. By a thin. Much more in terms of a straggling culture.

460
00:46:27,63 --> 00:46:35,59
And what that means in terms of. You know. Data and identity expressed through. Films. Music books.

461
00:46:35,59 --> 00:46:37,57
Social logical thought.

462
00:46:37,68 --> 00:46:40,36
And also one that we're still working through

00:46:40,36 --> 00:46:49,12
and my the year two thousand may be significant our place in southeast asia. That all our history was sad of.

464
00:46:49,12 --> 00:46:58,13
Pain cultural up. Areality was that. Significant impact of southeast asia. And i think that sort of enough.

465
00:46:58,13 --> 00:47:01,92
From that time onwards and that but didn't bring that about.

466
00:47:01,92 --> 00:47:07,27
But name them was writing a way that was about those sort of issues and a very sort of.

467
00:47:07,27 --> 00:47:14,39
Broad cultural change which will continue on in my further type of simply declare a republican a straight year in

468
00:47:14,39 --> 00:47:22,99
and the first of january of two thousand i think be a suitable time. To put a full stop to that sad story and say ok.

469
00:47:23,93 --> 00:47:28,29
New millenium. New place in the world.

470

I don't know whether they'll ever be another name in a way to be another name but. I mean it's quite interesting.
