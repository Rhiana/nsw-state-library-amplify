1
00:00:13,57 --> 00:00:23,83
Probably ok when we go. One. Great concern i have twenty years after the name an experiment started. Is that the ideas.

2
00:00:23,83 --> 00:00:33,74
And effects of the. The nimbin inverted commas. Workforce are certainly the best we have i think.

3
00:00:33,74 --> 00:00:41,73
We need something got lost. It's twit it's not twenty years since the newman experiment began.

4
00:00:41,73 --> 00:00:48,06
And i feel more than ever that the idea is an ethics of that era. Were exceptionally fine.

5
00:00:48,14 --> 00:00:53,48
And we don't have to apologize for these things. But what concerns me enormously is that often the.

6
00:00:53,48 --> 00:00:59,55
Energy levels don't match the ideas. And as opposed to this we have normal society where.

7
00:00:59,55 --> 00:01:03,76
Often there's tremendous energy. But it's usually destructive energy.

8
00:01:03,76 --> 00:01:11,3
And somehow we have to marry the ideas in aspirations and and. Wonderful philosophies. Of the new age.

9
00:01:11,3 --> 00:01:16,5
We think energy and ability and strength of the the old age of what you like to call it.

10
00:01:16,6 --> 00:01:22,14
I don't know how we do that because at the moment the energies and strengths of conventional society.

11
00:01:22,14 --> 00:01:24,62
Are destroying the planet. And we have to turn it around somehow.

12
00:01:25,4 --> 00:01:30,72
But sometimes when you see that lack of motivation amongst. Local grains.

13
00:01:30,72 --> 00:01:37,36
And the idea that somehow a lot just work out by itself. I despair. But in the long term i think.

14
00:01:37,36 --> 00:01:45,95
Somehow those ideas will come through and we will manage to meet them. We see activity levels as well.

15
00:01:45,95 --> 00:01:51,15
We have to be in it for the long haul we don't have a choice. We all have to work as well as we can.

16
00:01:51,15 --> 00:01:55,89
And the main way to do that at the moment is to keep. Positivity levels up. And i think this is where the.

17
00:01:55,89 --> 00:02:00,27
The american comic. Friend previous got an enormous amount to teach us.

18
00:02:00,27 --> 00:02:05,59
Because she is seems to have dedicated her life. Lightly to recognising the despair levels.

19
00:02:05,59 --> 00:02:10,67
In not only greens but a lot of the other people. On the planet. And she makes.

20
00:02:10,85 --> 00:02:14,76
Quite obvious the fact that you're not going to be effective in anything you fought for unless you stay positive

21
00:02:14,76 --> 00:02:20,35
and often that means laughing. So her mission. Is in fact. To make people laugh.

22
00:02:20,35 --> 00:02:29,52
About subjects that i guess you would call. Gallows humor there really terrible prospect death of. Planet nuclear war.

23
00:02:29,52 --> 00:02:34,78
Pollution on the grand scale but she can make us laugh about it and. In that way empower us completely.

24
00:02:35,26 --> 00:02:43,97
And so some of the dimensions that she's used in her talks i just find. Tremendously powerful for me. One of them is.

25
00:02:43,97 --> 00:02:49,75
This is the mantra that you say after you've been pretty depressed about a particular issue. And it goes.

26
00:02:49,75 --> 00:02:58,62
Oh what a disappointment and. Another. Another mantra of hers. Or slogan is. The people you know i did.

27
00:02:59,29 --> 00:03:01,44
Well sometimes win and sometimes lows.

28
00:03:02,48 --> 00:03:02,78
And

29
00:03:02,78 --> 00:03:07,33
when she says this in a big auditorium it brings the house down because we've all been there we've all ford issues

30
00:03:07,33 --> 00:03:09,98
and lost them and feel that was the end of the world.

31
00:03:09,98 --> 00:03:16,15
But she's teaching us to pick ourselves up and keep going it's ok to lose. That might be the end of the world.

32
00:03:16,15 --> 00:03:33,25
But it's not the end of you for the moment. Yes i do think there is quite a significant burnout level.

33
00:03:33,25 --> 00:03:34,88
Amongst a lot of the old aquarians.

34
00:03:34,88 --> 00:03:41,35
But against that we have an extremely hopeful sign of a whole new breed of people have in fact made an industry out of.

35
00:03:41,35 --> 00:03:48,00
Keeping people positive. And these people are extremely skilled and. Specialized in the book.

36
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:53,7
And these people are going to be the ones that really matter in the end. Because they can get us going again.

37
00:03:53,7 --> 00:03:58,73
And i think it's fair enough to take a lot of knock backs the planet is in bad shape. So it's.

38
00:03:58,73 --> 00:04:00,73
It's ok to be depressed about it.

39
00:04:00,73 --> 00:04:04,78
We just have to make sure we have a few little skills to get us back on track so we can keep fighting

40
00:04:04,78 --> 00:04:10,67
and feel that there is some reason to keep going because basically we don't have a choice do we can't back out. We're.

41
00:04:10,76 --> 00:04:15,66
In here we're stuck. And the only thing is to keep going and the only way to keep going is to stay positive.

42
00:04:15,66 --> 00:04:21,03
So it's a bit of a circle but. If you look at the right way you can feel it's all worthwhile.

43
00:04:21,03 --> 00:04:23,82
When you look at the beauty of the place how can you not fight for it.

44
00:04:23,82 --> 00:04:43,72
I always wonder why do people feel that it's hopeless. It's obvious that you have to keep going. Thank you. No to.

45
00:04:43,72 --> 00:04:45,41
Young hugh nicholson.

46
00:04:45,61 --> 00:04:55,43
I came to the area to throw me a creek in one hundred seventy four i was the teacher in norman and.

47
00:04:55,43 --> 00:05:01,76
Gradually became more and more aware of problems of pollution and environmental degradation or it was tough and.

48
00:05:01,76 --> 00:05:04,21
Although i was getting through to.

49
00:05:04,21 --> 00:05:09,98
Kids with my teaching i just filled in what i really wanted to do was to try and live.

50
00:05:09,98 --> 00:05:14,87
A simpler lifestyle and see what was possible rather than just trying to tell people about where you could do it.

51
00:05:14,87 --> 00:05:23,07
And so. With and then i set off looking for land and after of years searching we found a place here.

52
00:05:23,07 --> 00:05:32,42
And tried to actually dropped out i guess you'd say. Supposedly living a subsistence lifestyle and very simply.

53
00:05:32,42 --> 00:05:37,72
But in fact. It's extraordinary good to food to do anything but not only difficult but.

54
00:05:37,72 --> 00:05:41,77
Living a subsistence life at the start was incredibly boring.

55
00:05:41,77 --> 00:05:47,89
Because you've got to work you've got an every day and you've got to make sure that the birds don't pinch your fruit

56
00:05:47,89 --> 00:05:54,59
and and. Then there are some things that you can't produce readily like bryce or weight or whatever.

57
00:05:54,59 --> 00:06:00,41
And you do need some money to buy so you end up getting caught up in that cycle on that system anyway.

58
00:06:00,41 --> 00:06:07,52
But we still have a lot of those philosophies are producing what i'm talking we can. From our own place and.

59
00:06:07,52 --> 00:06:21,02
Still living. A simpler lifestyle and. Nice people but. We not been to on pure self-sufficiency anymore.

60
00:06:22,31 --> 00:06:26,42
It was an end at the time we came it was what we intended to do.

61
00:06:26,42 --> 00:06:32,66
But within a couple weeks of arriving at the running a creek. We heard of.

62
00:06:32,66 --> 00:06:37,19
Forest commission plans to log around your creek and when we followed up.

63
00:06:37,19 --> 00:06:43,41
That inquiry we found out that the plans were. To log. All the millivolt timber.

64
00:06:44,09 --> 00:06:51,18
And then to clear feller east and burn it and plant. With g.v. Plant eucalypts.

65
00:06:51,18 --> 00:06:57,3
And only two species because they're the only trees that will grow faster than lantana and. So our intention.

66
00:06:57,3 --> 00:07:03,8
And what they were doing in the rest of the local state forests at that time was no clearing about five hundred acres a

67
00:07:03,8 --> 00:07:13,08
year and. Replanting it. Do you call it a flood again and blacked out and. Since we look out on to this.

68
00:07:13,08 --> 00:07:20,72
To ronnie creek on the walls of rainforest and so on here. The concept of having that converted from rainforest to.

69
00:07:20,72 --> 00:07:31,47
Eucalypt plantation. Full of lantana. Was just absolutely beyond comprehension so that's why we started fighting.

70
00:07:31,47 --> 00:07:42,16
Complaining. Well i've just happened to be here one day and to hear a vehicle up in the forest and.

71
00:07:42,16 --> 00:07:48,61
We were at the end of of a one way road as far as i was aware that there was no road beyond us.

72
00:07:48,61 --> 00:07:50,47
And when i walk through the forest.

73
00:07:50,47 --> 00:07:51,31
To explore and try

74
00:07:51,31 --> 00:07:58,75
and track down the sound i found that there was an old forest road coming down the side of the hill and. There was a.

75
00:07:58,75 --> 00:08:03,73
Forestry road gang and working there cleaning up the water tables and.

76
00:08:03,73 --> 00:08:08,89
I asked whether they had any intentions of using that road for access to to ronnie creek

77
00:08:08,89 --> 00:08:14,84
and were they playing to logon. In their innocence the. The fellows on the working said yes.

78
00:08:14,84 --> 00:08:20,22
And i think i've learned a lot since then i don't tend to be so open with their answers anymore.

79
00:08:20,22 --> 00:08:26,22
And so having got a yes from them that they would be in sometime we immediately contacted the office in mumbai which is

80
00:08:26,22 --> 00:08:33,49
a local forestry office and asked. What were the intentions. And again.

81
00:08:33,49 --> 00:08:39,94
Because they hadn't confronted a situation like this before with people opposing what i was doing.

82
00:08:39,94 --> 00:08:48,61
They were open with their answers and said yes they're intended to clear philip byrne and converted you.

83
00:08:48,61 --> 00:08:59,63
And so it went on from there. You. Was about five years.

84
00:08:59,63 --> 00:09:09,3
Of ongoing letters to politicians trying to develop a public awareness so we were conducting walks up into the forest

85
00:09:09,3 --> 00:09:17,17
with anybody you want to go and. Part of the problem with that was that. Some of the forest.

86
00:09:17,17 --> 00:09:21,25
Had been logged in the past and so it was unlocked but it was about a two hour walk.

87
00:09:21,25 --> 00:09:28,25
Because the old logging road was very lantana no sore start and it made slow walking so about time you got somebody.

88
00:09:28,25 --> 00:09:32,68
Two hours into the forest they were ready to turn around or come out again because they are mostly city people

89
00:09:32,68 --> 00:09:36,34
and their impression was at all being logged.

90
00:09:36,34 --> 00:09:41,1
And they didn't actually get to see this other major portion of it we hadn't been logged in the past

91
00:09:41,1 --> 00:09:47,36
and was absolutely spectacular. And so we were. We were up against that as a problem. Quite often.

92
00:09:47,36 --> 00:09:55,31
That people didn't have the stamina to actually see understood forest and.

93
00:09:55,31 --> 00:10:07,24
Didn't have the knowledge to appreciate the effects that loading it had on the other force and.

94
00:10:07,24 --> 00:10:12,54
The absolute highlight of the blockade for me was the. Organization of the camp.

95
00:10:12,54 --> 00:10:23,53
I was just so impressed by the ability of. What a so-called derogatorily called he piece. To coordinate.

96
00:10:23,53 --> 00:10:31,36
So will the camp. Within the first by the. The first. The end of the first day.

97
00:10:31,36 --> 00:10:39,21
Or second day we had water on to the camp. And from then on for the. Four weeks or whatever it was of the camp.

98
00:10:39,21 --> 00:10:46,32
There was hot. Running water for showers. At any time day or night. There were incredible meals cooked.

99
00:10:46,32 --> 00:10:53,69
We had donations of food from more shopkeepers would donate stuff and and.

100
00:10:53,69 --> 00:10:57,89
People would go out and buy supplies and bring them in donate them to the camp and there were.

101
00:10:57,89 --> 00:11:04,41
There was one group of people who just decided to be the cooks. And they put on three course meals.

102
00:11:04,41 --> 00:11:10,89
Every day it was just brilliant. They were better in fact than a lot better than we were eating.

103
00:11:10,89 --> 00:11:17,86
Back at our house because we were so involved in. Phone calls and media stuff.

104
00:11:17,86 --> 00:11:23,01
That there was often not time to prepare me it was it was really scratch me it was out there there were did people

105
00:11:23,01 --> 00:11:30,26
dedicated to just getting the meal and then there were fire wood gatherers and. And so on and.

106
00:11:30,26 --> 00:11:37,48
So that was in the camp itself. And back here at the house. We had people with. Media skills.

107
00:11:37,48 --> 00:11:43,47
We had one guy who every day would pull a fine apart and connect these wires into a scene these press releases off.

108
00:11:43,47 --> 00:11:48,88
Directly through the phone. And there was a. Duplicating machine a p.r.

109
00:11:48,88 --> 00:11:55,43
Corner where from but it appeared and it was in the galleries just. And every night. It was. Duplicating off.

110
00:11:55,43 --> 00:11:57,92
Press release and so on for handouts to the media

111
00:11:57,92 --> 00:12:06,89
when they turned up the next day so it was just incredibly well organized and it all just. Time together.

112
00:12:06,89 --> 00:12:11,97
And i found that fascinating and interesting me after four weeks of occupy. Ation of a campsite.

113
00:12:12,38 --> 00:12:17,59
There was no rubbish there. The only sign that people had been there was the grass was a bit flattened.

114
00:12:17,59 --> 00:12:21,18
And a couple of people had levelled sloping down to put a team.

115
00:12:21,18 --> 00:12:26,87
That was in there was all the rubbish had been buried and all that so stuff and yet.

116
00:12:26,87 --> 00:12:36,61
Within a week of the camp being dismantled. There were opposing groups who were coming out having rallies.

117
00:12:36,61 --> 00:12:42,65
In the area trying to promote their angle. And invariably we had to spend a day after each one of these.

118
00:12:42,65 --> 00:13:04,01
Cleaning up the rubbish and they gathered afterwards it was really dramatic contrast in comparison. Well.

119
00:13:04,01 --> 00:13:09,84
It wasn't a pua victory i guess it was a victory in that. The logging was stopped.

120
00:13:09,84 --> 00:13:18,58
And it's interesting to talk about the politics of the actual stopping of the logging because everyone stage the.

121
00:13:18,58 --> 00:13:24,65
Loggers were intent on feeling as many trees as possible and so they were just coming in

122
00:13:24,65 --> 00:13:28,76
and dropping trees as fast they could almost on the run they'd fill a tree.

123
00:13:28,76 --> 00:13:33,36
And some of these trees were radio carbon dated at in excess of a thousand years

124
00:13:33,36 --> 00:13:40,61
and that all really impressive trees and. The figures that we got were that there were about six hundred trees.

125
00:13:40,61 --> 00:13:45,89
That was all in toronto to create it was a very minor issue really and.

126
00:13:45,89 --> 00:13:48,85
They found out that if they logged as fast as they could.

127
00:13:48,85 --> 00:13:52,81
Then they could get twenty trees a day on the ground and often that meant.

128
00:13:52,81 --> 00:13:57,65
Falling trees across each other which in some cases split the trunk so it was incredibly wasteful.

129
00:13:57,65 --> 00:13:59,7
But only just really going forward.

130
00:13:59,7 --> 00:14:05,25
And you buy one friday afternoon that deadspin today are doing is just filling trees as fast as possible.

131
00:14:05,25 --> 00:14:10,67
And then they knocked off and went home for the weekend and. Over the weekend. Somebody. And we still don't know who.

132
00:14:11,38 --> 00:14:16,99
Somebody went up and actually cut up. The fallen trees into. To me the links. They just saw through them.

133
00:14:16,99 --> 00:14:25,24
With a chainsaw and. There was a lot of adverse. Media from that and the.

134
00:14:25,24 --> 00:14:30,68
Storming lobby obviously picked up on it as being the most horrendous lady vandeleur stick thing to have done.

135
00:14:31,59 --> 00:14:38,28
But what it meant was that when they came back next week. They only filled. Three trees a day.

136
00:14:38,28 --> 00:14:42,75
Because the trees were so big that i can only fit part of a tree. On a logging jinger.

137
00:14:42,75 --> 00:14:46,29
And i could only take nine trucks out a day and.

138
00:14:46,29 --> 00:14:51,43
It slowed the whole operation down they worked on for another week and they cut another twenty trees.

139
00:14:51,43 --> 00:14:57,67
But if they hadn't been stymied by the feeling and by the cutting up of the fallen logs.

140
00:14:57,67 --> 00:15:05,86
They would have had the job half done in that way. So it was interesting how how that. Action which.

141
00:15:05,86 --> 00:15:11,3
Got a lot of bad press was in fact what save the forest and now of course everybody says. It around to create.

142
00:15:11,3 --> 00:15:19,4
What a benchmark decision that was the forerunner of. Of this world heritage rainforest which we are also proud of but.

143
00:15:19,4 --> 00:15:33,52
It comes from what was seen as being. And yes. Rare as a politician was on the side but.

144
00:15:33,52 --> 00:15:35,38
He we had a very divided cabinet.

145
00:15:35,38 --> 00:15:37,07
And so it was a fine balancing act

146
00:15:37,07 --> 00:15:46,35
and he got caught up in in trying to spin the thing out long enough to get enough people in cabinet to to come on side.

147
00:15:46,35 --> 00:15:53,54
And so on in the way that the logging was stopped yes we won. But. We then had an inquiry and.

148
00:15:53,54 --> 00:15:59,05
I would never ever recommend anybody again. Asking for an inquiry.

149
00:15:59,05 --> 00:16:04,42
As being the way out of an issue because we got involved in an exhausting.

150
00:16:04,42 --> 00:16:10,67
Inquiry that went on for thirty two years i think and.

151
00:16:11,4 --> 00:16:16,24
The forestry people had all their experts in the sawmill is had their paid it. Birds and.

152
00:16:16,24 --> 00:16:19,38
We were expected to be there to put our case.

153
00:16:19,38 --> 00:16:23,85
If we weren't there when we were unable to refute the stuff that they said. But obviously.

154
00:16:23,85 --> 00:16:30,46
All of it came out of our pockets and. That went against us too because the judge said. We were in there.

155
00:16:30,95 --> 00:16:36,41
Not for financial gain. But because we were emotionally involved. And if we were inviting me involved.

156
00:16:36,41 --> 00:16:41,41
Then obviously our evidence was suspect. Whereas these guys working for forestry commission.

157
00:16:41,41 --> 00:16:46,39
Who are being paid to do their job and if they didn't say the right things would lose their job. That was ok.

158
00:16:46,39 --> 00:16:50,57
Obviously everything i said was perfectly true and correct. It was a very difficult inquiry.

159
00:16:50,7 --> 00:16:58,87
It was hard during the inquiry to stay. Enthusiastic. Tell you a classic.

160
00:16:58,87 --> 00:17:04,21
One of our people was giving evidence on the wildlife use of the forest and the need for.

161
00:17:04,21 --> 00:17:06,75
Old growth trees with olive branches.

162
00:17:06,75 --> 00:17:12,23
And he'd gone into quite a long explanation of the types of animals the possums and the gliders and the elves

163
00:17:12,23 --> 00:17:15,39
and all the stuff that uses.

164
00:17:15,39 --> 00:17:18,68
Hollow branches in the fact that a number of these are rare and endangered animals

165
00:17:18,68 --> 00:17:27,4
and they are current around you creek. And after page of evidence. On this the judge finally turned to him and said.

166
00:17:27,4 --> 00:17:33,43
I can see the relevance of this information. The lawyers don't take the hollow branches they lift. In the forest.

167
00:17:34,43 --> 00:17:40,00
What's the problem. So the judge could not see that hollow branches one hundred feet in the ground.

168
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:46,9
Used by animals that use the canopy of the forest. He believes that the same branches lying on the forest floor.

169
00:17:46,9 --> 00:17:51,7
Would be just as useful. To the owls and possums. So he's view was that.

170
00:17:51,7 --> 00:17:58,66
Just taking up the stems and leaving the branches. Was quite ok so he's. Understanding of.

171
00:17:58,66 --> 00:18:06,45
Ecological points was nonexistent. He was horrified and for us he couldn't stand it.

172
00:18:06,45 --> 00:18:12,9
And one stage we took all the rest of the enquiry down to. A particular.

173
00:18:12,9 --> 00:18:19,76
Pool in the creek where the locals had used it for picnics for fifty years they have been visiting this place.

174
00:18:19,76 --> 00:18:25,57
And he couldn't get there because he was so old and decrepit that he couldn't get off the track. And so we.

175
00:18:25,57 --> 00:18:30,78
When we got back up to the cows and he was asking what we had seen.

176
00:18:30,78 --> 00:18:36,46
And we told him of the people reporting back to him told him what they had seen and his response that was.

177
00:18:36,46 --> 00:18:41,27
Were there any picnic tables chairs barbecues.

178
00:18:41,44 --> 00:18:46,09
The answer was no so he displayed all the evidence that anybody might have used that place for picking it was

179
00:18:46,09 --> 00:18:50,43
ridiculous to assume that people would use it. There weren't barbecues and picnic tables in.

180
00:18:50,43 --> 00:18:56,26
It was a lie to suggest that people use that place. He couldn't comprehend people going to the forest for enjoyment.

181
00:18:56,26 --> 00:19:01,24
And being prepared to walk. It was an uphill battle was hooey.

182
00:19:08,09 --> 00:19:16,32
I think that unfortunately i think that there are still a lot of people who are city based.

183
00:19:16,32 --> 00:19:24,43
Who would still see feel the same way. And that is the battle now for the green movement.

184
00:19:24,43 --> 00:19:32,22
Is to get through to the people who don't relate to the natural environment that.

185
00:19:32,22 --> 00:19:37,43
No matter what they think the natural environment relates to them. And that they're tied up with it.

186
00:19:37,43 --> 00:19:41,84
And that they can't escape it. And i think for people who live all a life in the city.

187
00:19:41,84 --> 00:19:49,43
It is possible to believe that the problems that are talked about don't exist.

188
00:19:49,43 --> 00:19:58,5
And if in fact you live in a how to get in a car park in a covered car park and go to work in an office. Come home.

189
00:19:58,5 --> 00:20:03,66
You don't need to know what the moon is doing you don't need to know when it's clouding raining.

190
00:20:03,66 --> 00:20:10,07
Unless there's a bit of an inconvenience of the weekend so you don't need to relate to the environment. And that.

191
00:20:10,07 --> 00:20:16,2
That is the problem. You're getting kids who are growing up in this you know don't see trees who don't run on grass.

192
00:20:16,2 --> 00:20:25,41
So it's people like that who who find it really hard to relate to the environment. And to see that.

193
00:20:25,41 --> 00:20:33,66
Problems of pollution. Will eventually have an effect on them. The rubbish that they produce.

194
00:20:33,66 --> 00:20:37,52
Has to go into a landfill somewhere and. Landfill sites are running out.

195
00:20:37,52 --> 00:20:41,22
What do we do with the rubbish do we in fact do what they do in america and take out the seed and barge

196
00:20:41,22 --> 00:20:43,34
and just are going to bottom and dump it.

197
00:20:44,93 --> 00:20:57,39
There's a limit to how many times you can do that you're working on table a day it's the sixth of december

198
00:20:57,39 --> 00:21:13,00
and you know. And we're speaking with spain. Hayes. It's p i n n portugal. Ok. And you sell and say.

199
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:23,57
Yes but my name is david spain. I made forty five now. I came to town double falls in early not in seventy five.

200
00:21:23,57 --> 00:21:30,19
At that time i'd been living alone in the countryside. North of bathurst.

201
00:21:30,19 --> 00:21:37,98
And working in the attorney general's department as a liaison officer. Trying to get a fix on.

202
00:21:37,98 --> 00:21:43,04
What was wrong with the world and how to set it right. Why there were such phenomena.

203
00:21:43,04 --> 00:21:52,99
And as especially the war in vietnam for which i amongst many other of my then ballot of the in the increasing

204
00:21:52,99 --> 00:22:10,67
pollution which was becoming obvious. Twenty years ago or so of inner cities. Rich poor gap. Unemployment.

205
00:22:12,47 --> 00:22:18,94
That's part of the post war by bieber and generation which. Always grew up with pace and plenty.

206
00:22:20,85 --> 00:22:29,86
The vietnam war was an enormous culture shock. I think to. All of my generation. That such a horrific.

207
00:22:29,86 --> 00:22:36,49
Occurrence could. Embroil us personally.

208
00:22:36,49 --> 00:22:47,68
Think of scripted was an affront to the spirit and conscience to fight a war we saw as little intellectual life.

209
00:22:47,68 --> 00:23:00,28
After the war of course with them came to power. That was your four year. Suddenly the possibility of really building.

210
00:23:00,28 --> 00:23:07,59
Examples of utopian. Lifestyle in a strange. And evidencing allow impact and way of life.

211
00:23:07,59 --> 00:23:17,19
Which made big centralized government unnecessary. Allowed people to only work a day or two awake for income.

212
00:23:17,19 --> 00:23:23,04
And the rest of the time. Either. For some. Subsistence farming or building their own homes.

213
00:23:23,04 --> 00:23:31,53
Exploring the finer things of life music. Grading meditation. This whole.

214
00:23:31,53 --> 00:23:35,55
Utopian view stuff because i'm possible of implementation or so it's aimed.

215
00:23:39,82 --> 00:23:51,85
Then the queries festival was held in may of not in seventy three. It was a coming together of this flower power. Love.

216
00:23:51,85 --> 00:24:07,7
Idealism a sense of empathy between people which was the product of the post-war generation. Coming up against the.

217
00:24:07,7 --> 00:24:15,81
Agnus of viet nam conflict. And i'm sure. Psychedelic drugs had a lot to do with it.

218
00:24:15,81 --> 00:24:25,35
It's quite a unique generation looking back. And. Out of the aquarius festival. Came. The project.

219
00:24:25,35 --> 00:24:35,18
Of buying a property and. Setting up a permanent. Sustainable community. Into elling.

220
00:24:35,18 --> 00:24:42,08
Those ideals which we held during the previous decade.

221
00:24:42,08 --> 00:24:51,38
Shares were sold for a mere two hundred dollars in total for gradually this was sold to some people who bought a share

222
00:24:51,38 --> 00:24:58,13
in an idea. Others who came to settle here. And within two or three years this entire property.

223
00:24:58,13 --> 00:25:08,37
Hundred four thousand dollars. Had been subscribed to and paid off. The valleys.

224
00:25:08,37 --> 00:25:16,17
Spearing in from the south to the nightcap range with spare lines running down into the clear valley.

225
00:25:16,17 --> 00:25:28,89
And timber along the ridges. The initial settlers. Bearing and amber between forty and seventy or so.

226
00:25:28,89 --> 00:25:33,29
Mostly lived together in the old farmhouse the center of the property.

227
00:25:33,29 --> 00:25:40,14
Which was painted white and was ironically called the white house. At the north end.

228
00:25:40,14 --> 00:25:51,2
Was another worker's cottage where a group of fifteen or twenty settled themselves. So initially the.

229
00:25:51,2 --> 00:25:59,79
Political motivation would have been close to communist utopia where the idea was everyone living and working together.

230
00:25:59,79 --> 00:26:10,67
In some wholly happy organism. But within a year or so there are a lot of tensions developing in the workers hired.

231
00:26:11,13 --> 00:26:21,48
Obliges. The people who wear particular to drugs who would want to do the smoking.

232
00:26:21,48 --> 00:26:31,72
Magic mushrooms and so on all the time. Vegetarians don't like the late eighty's. One reason or another the initial.

233
00:26:31,72 --> 00:26:42,5
Communist utopia. Fell apart and. Groups of people who were basically like minded. Went off and pioneered hamlet.

234
00:26:42,5 --> 00:26:49,96
Settlements on the spur lines coming down in the valleys. Very quickly they were fifteen twenty maybe thirty.

235
00:26:49,96 --> 00:26:57,53
Of these little hamlets. Groups of three five six households.

236
00:26:58,61 --> 00:27:03,54
In the hamlets the settlers are semi autonomous from the cooperative.

237
00:27:03,54 --> 00:27:08,82
And belong to the cooperative there was no survey title. Given to any individual shareholder.

238
00:27:12,67 --> 00:27:17,18
People started building homes and it quickly became realised that some sort of control was necessary.

239
00:27:19,62 --> 00:27:26,85
One big guy friend was brought high up on a ridge. Its roof obvious up and down the entire length of the valley.

240
00:27:26,85 --> 00:27:32,93
And rules were quickly passed that. People who wanted to build houses had to get. Co-operative approval.

241
00:27:32,93 --> 00:27:36,82
First a flag had to be rise to the height of the intended roof

242
00:27:36,82 --> 00:27:44,23
and i'd just given in a month later approval could be sought. And then the local council got in on the act.

243
00:27:44,23 --> 00:27:51,71
And required building plans. So the co-operative made it a condition of granting the approval. That.

244
00:27:51,71 --> 00:28:03,52
Council approval plans be filed with the secretary at the same time. So people. Built their own homes.

245
00:28:04,93 --> 00:28:17,26
Norma's for royalty of homes. Often just small timber. Cabins with a single room and of a rare. Sometimes homes which.

246
00:28:17,26 --> 00:28:25,7
Approximate in size and normal australian suburban home. Sometimes quite rear. Unusual.

247
00:28:25,7 --> 00:28:41,6
Buildings such as a star own house or a fair or cement. Diam. People pretty well left a charger alone.

248
00:28:41,6 --> 00:28:48,34
Does her industrious work to building their homes. Planting orchards.

249
00:28:48,34 --> 00:28:55,64
Others quickly brought a bit of shelter and perhaps did nothing after death

250
00:28:55,64 --> 00:29:15,44
or perhaps focus their energies on some aspect of music or. Environmental activism. The cooperative mates.

251
00:29:15,44 --> 00:29:22,54
At an annual general meeting once a year and elect a board. Under the rules of the cooperative.

252
00:29:23,68 --> 00:29:33,86
The board has ultimate power to make decisions for and binding upon the entire community or shareholders.

253
00:29:33,86 --> 00:29:38,96
For a long time. The. Elected board was more or less nominal.

254
00:29:38,96 --> 00:29:51,36
It didn't exercise any independent power because this invited. Accusations of being. Some sort of fascist totalitarian.

255
00:29:51,36 --> 00:29:59,92
The community instead. Net every month. At what was called a trouble meeting. And it was this.

256
00:29:59,92 --> 00:30:05,00
Amorphous meeting of ever happened to turn up once a month which tended to make decisions and.

257
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:13,32
From time to time implement them. Alive. My observation would be that. And still use that.

258
00:30:13,32 --> 00:30:16,63
Nice paper three lived to act as policeman.

259
00:30:16,63 --> 00:30:21,39
A lot of decisions are being made over and over again reinventing the wheel over the years.

260
00:30:21,39 --> 00:30:33,09
Not enforced or implemented. But perhaps gradually there's building up a consciousness of what will be disciplined and.

261
00:30:33,09 --> 00:30:46,75
What will be tolerated. It's very liberal liberal liberal. Little liberal communities growing out of it.

262
00:30:46,75 --> 00:30:52,24
Seen enormous tolerance for differences.

263
00:30:52,24 --> 00:31:06,57
Folk tend to live each other alone unless they absolutely transgress the guidelines. It's always sad and very that.

264
00:31:06,57 --> 00:31:14,96
They spend so little endeavor. As regards growing orchards and vegetable gardens.

265
00:31:14,96 --> 00:31:22,33
These are still a lot of waves on the hillsides. There's still a lot of dependence on welfare.

266
00:31:23,3 --> 00:31:26,5
When one would have hoped. Five could be undone.
