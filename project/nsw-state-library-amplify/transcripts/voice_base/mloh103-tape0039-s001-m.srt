00:00:21,87 --> 00:00:31,37
This is karen so perky interviewing rain apparently in this mall on the fifth of ninety ninety three take to reno tell

2
00:00:31,37 --> 00:00:40,69
me about some of the school stories. Can you remember anything particular about going to school.

3
00:00:41,33 --> 00:00:47,98
My only thing that sticks most me in my mind is when we went to my brother and i are going to do you guys school.

4
00:00:47,98 --> 00:00:53,69
My parents couldn't speak english so obviously they wouldn't take us to school and that was you know old really.

5
00:00:53,69 --> 00:00:59,76
And my brother had too much work to do everyone had so much work to do that we had to go on our own. So.

6
00:00:59,76 --> 00:01:05,08
From right up on top. What was called gun alley. We went down to and you go our school.

7
00:01:05,64 --> 00:01:10,8
We went to the school ran and stood there apart because nobody knew us.

8
00:01:10,8 --> 00:01:16,1
When the bell rang to go in we marched in with the other kids but seeing that we had that we had to see it.

9
00:01:16,1 --> 00:01:21,35
We just told in print of the class. When they everyone was so good.

10
00:01:21,35 --> 00:01:30,1
The teacher turned towards this is not him was mr mcnaught. And he said. Why are you here.

11
00:01:30,1 --> 00:01:35,67
And my brother who was older than i but he was a bit more timid myself. He didn't say anything.

12
00:01:35,67 --> 00:01:43,66
So i said because my mother seen me. So then he needs say this but it wasn't a very good introduction to school.

13
00:01:43,66 --> 00:01:50,99
But i rather large school so i got on all right. But he was the only one that gave me that kind.

14
00:01:50,99 --> 00:01:55,98
And even to this guy but i got because i met him and what i'm going to call.

15
00:01:56,61 --> 00:02:05,98
What did you get it for where we were reading outside..

16
00:02:00,12 --> 00:02:09,51
When we were sitting in stools then he told us we were to read the post. Paragraph h. And i love reading especially.

17
00:02:10,11 --> 00:02:14,66
And the girl next to me. Just kept on and on and on and she wouldn't sit down.

18
00:02:14,66 --> 00:02:18,94
So i got a boy that got him by the grace and gave her a tag.

19
00:02:19,12 --> 00:02:24,63
And i don't know if she stumbled or what but anyway the two just saw me and he gave me two cats

20
00:02:24,63 --> 00:02:32,11
and they came up in blisters on me and i just think god did it for matt. Maybe he had other ideas.

21
00:02:32,11 --> 00:02:38,16
But he had written here i might add that i'm not ready to stop of our modern mind of blue.

22
00:02:38,16 --> 00:02:47,39
But what kind of lunches did you take to school. I don't talk to me but having lunch is carrying.

23
00:02:47,97 --> 00:02:53,22
We have to have home my bread. And i hide it.

24
00:02:53,22 --> 00:03:00,55
Everybody had this noise square on board bridge and we had home mine braided in the summer it was really delicious.

25
00:03:00,55 --> 00:03:07,35
You could smell it you know cooking in the window wasn't so successful. But mum. Mother or. My sister used to do it.

26
00:03:07,35 --> 00:03:14,46
She used to maggot sort of in a long bun. And that wasn't square. I want to square braid.

27
00:03:14,46 --> 00:03:21,88
And on top of that i had to help my god what they do would be to get the yeast. And in the beginning.

28
00:03:21,88 --> 00:03:29,56
By somehow my the yeast and of the stomach of cups or something on them and i can't even tell you.

29
00:03:29,56 --> 00:03:34,00
There might be other people that can tell you that as you go along.

30
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:41,82
That we may see my night in with the years we used about a flare in they would be in their hundred pound bags i think

31
00:03:41,82 --> 00:03:48,2
that like a corn bag. And it said it sorry. Was it program can you think. The now.

32
00:03:49,00 --> 00:03:55,06
Well not so much for us because we did use a lot. Sort of thing not that i can remember. Anyway.

33
00:03:55,76 --> 00:04:00,49
And then that's to say it and then of course it had to be needed.

34
00:04:00,49 --> 00:04:07,36
So that devised a contraption which was a bad it would create or two and a half foot square board.

35
00:04:07,36 --> 00:04:11,6
And then on that it had a stick a text. With some about sidney and.

36
00:04:11,6 --> 00:04:18,36
And i was the one that had to go up and they are up and down with the stick while the others to break into it and.

37
00:04:18,36 --> 00:04:26,18
So that's the story about brave and i just didn't complete all have or for a wife felt that brave.

38
00:04:26,18 --> 00:04:29,02
And if we were a man. Sometimes rename it up.

39
00:04:29,02 --> 00:04:33,3
And this is trying because i mean it's just a reminder though i mean the other day.

40
00:04:33,3 --> 00:04:41,39
My eldest sister would make patty cakes. So it was a the high and my great aunt patty cakes. How many lies.

41
00:04:41,39 --> 00:04:48,66
How many lies. Would you like you know the section of fish and. Well i really don't remember but.

42
00:04:48,66 --> 00:04:54,57
We used to my community every day. So it was always fresh bread.

43
00:04:54,57 --> 00:05:03,5
And now i mean you know fresh green bean thing wouldn't mind what would you take with it just has to be changed so

44
00:05:03,5 --> 00:05:09,68
jamie i think. And i think within the americas article didn't know about payment but when jim martin was dies.

45
00:05:09,68 --> 00:05:13,99
I suppose it was around that we didn't our bit of it

46
00:05:13,99 --> 00:05:20,99
and another thing i remember from that same school was that in war time not me jumping ahead a bit

47
00:05:20,99 --> 00:05:28,7
but it doesn't matter. During the war. This was to go screw you go to school i want to be a man. And you know.

48
00:05:28,7 --> 00:05:39,08
Close on to fourteen men and destroy a sea of me saying. Italians destroy him. Abort the romance. Only and.

49
00:05:39,08 --> 00:05:46,59
Everyone was so happy that the teacher gave us a half day holiday. So i went and i said. Have come yet.

50
00:05:46,59 --> 00:05:56,95
And i said we're going to have to i hope one day because the save me saying abort me. Where you should have seen it.

51
00:05:56,95 --> 00:06:03,62
I said don't you know that that's an italian ship. And they were all italians on that. And i have.

52
00:06:03,62 --> 00:06:10,49
Countrymen what sank. I didn't i was a tell you know i was just a kid. That must have been a bit confusing. The child.

53
00:06:10,49 --> 00:06:13,32
Well it was going to sing you know why that. L.r.

54
00:06:13,32 --> 00:06:21,11
Didn't change at all because my brother was naturalized therefore we had a radio all the time. And he had a gun.

55
00:06:21,11 --> 00:06:29,02
Which i'm naturalized. People had to put the scene. And they also had to give a radio.

56
00:06:29,02 --> 00:06:34,16
But we had this big i think they used to call him a jewish. Radio. It was a big.

57
00:06:34,16 --> 00:06:39,86
Contraption anyway about two and a half feet wide but three feet high.

58
00:06:39,86 --> 00:06:44,45
And we would be able to catch the transmissions from either scenes.

59
00:06:44,45 --> 00:06:49,34
So i was found out and remember there are always trying to listen to news from italy.

60
00:06:49,34 --> 00:06:53,76
I don't have a favorite heard in me. So if you know if they will send it.

61
00:06:53,76 --> 00:06:57,91
Naturalized was it illegal for him to have it right here yes they would have taken it off. Me a bit.

62
00:06:57,91 --> 00:07:07,66
In the tour this is during the war you know his heart was a bit. Fourteen years.

63
00:07:07,66 --> 00:07:13,27
Was there any danger enough that the many of your family. Be taken prisoner of war during the eyes. Yes.

64
00:07:13,27 --> 00:07:22,94
Well i suppose there was always the danger that a man of our family when my father was rather elderly and.

65
00:07:22,94 --> 00:07:29,06
But i would have to have some evidence that had. I have been the fastest. Paddy in the family.

66
00:07:29,06 --> 00:07:35,79
Which none of us when my brother lived through it when he was i mean there was no way. He could have been.

67
00:07:35,79 --> 00:07:44,12
But just sign. I just like to say here that. The feelings for the mum elaine was too strong. At that time.

68
00:07:44,12 --> 00:07:49,2
And you can understand more that would you want to listen to news.

69
00:07:49,2 --> 00:07:55,36
And even people that knew that we had the radio that asked did you hear in him you. You know.

70
00:07:55,36 --> 00:08:00,69
This was one thing that they're striking and sort of found hand hard to understand.

71
00:08:00,69 --> 00:08:08,48
But if you think that if you had been a strange country and. Couldn't speak the language.

72
00:08:08,48 --> 00:08:16,12
It would have been nice to hear. Your own time. But of course it was war and.

73
00:08:16,12 --> 00:08:22,36
There was no you didn't hear your parents be talking about anyone else.

74
00:08:22,36 --> 00:08:27,02
Being taken this reason or formerly were others that are just.

75
00:08:27,02 --> 00:08:33,5
That probably need but i just forget the ny times now and. Maybe sort of.

76
00:08:33,5 --> 00:08:42,82
That wouldn't want to be putting in the why the good guy remember one one time. Just to tell you sort of help.

77
00:08:42,82 --> 00:08:50,13
Things were. This is going back a while when i was a bad team my mother was very sick. She had to go to hospital.

78
00:08:50,13 --> 00:08:52,52
She had three operations in the one that.

79
00:08:53,39 --> 00:08:58,96
And everyone thought that she wouldn't like it that was the feeling that we had at home.

80
00:08:58,96 --> 00:09:05,98
But i didn't go on to say it because i didn't have a decent for up to put on. And being poor but prayer.

81
00:09:05,98 --> 00:09:13,89
And especially my mother was a very proud woman. But she wouldn't want to probably see me if i wasn't dressed properly.

82
00:09:13,89 --> 00:09:19,23
But anyway the decision was made that i didn't get on so you know. She didn't like it by the way i moved to.

83
00:09:19,23 --> 00:09:26,95
Not to be nobody to know what was wrong with no one was a gold star and. One was the appendix.

84
00:09:26,95 --> 00:09:31,02
And the other one her stomach and for.

85
00:09:31,02 --> 00:09:38,2
Dr mccoy i performed the operation she had been to doctors in sydney and all over the place because she was so sick.

86
00:09:38,2 --> 00:09:47,01
And the family had what was wrong and she made it and was pretty healthy after that we would say from.

87
00:09:47,01 --> 00:09:57,34
Doctor and i don't know what it was used to have officers on the corner room. And now as we're straight i think.

88
00:09:57,34 --> 00:10:02,55
So he was in this mall. He was in recent years years he was a little more doctor not a very old doctor.

89
00:10:02,55 --> 00:10:09,51
Maybe it was it would have been either you know something about him and. I remember getting mean to say my mother.

90
00:10:09,97 --> 00:10:15,84
Unlike a later time when she had a bad child. And she said she said.

91
00:10:15,84 --> 00:10:20,48
Get me up at three o'clock in the morning you see certain washing machine that i can get warm again

92
00:10:20,48 --> 00:10:25,44
and she said i'm just freezing cold or do you think i can do anything about it.

93
00:10:25,44 --> 00:10:34,41
So i might have my business to be there when dr mccoy. And i said to him dr i said mom said. So and such.

94
00:10:34,41 --> 00:10:43,00
And he turned to the nurse and said. Why do you wash her at that time. And she said our doctor she says that's.

95
00:10:43,00 --> 00:10:51,52
Routine we wash patients and that time and he said labor dirty then. And after that she was washed in the daytime.

96
00:10:51,52 --> 00:10:52,13
The session.

97
00:10:52,13 --> 00:10:55,09
Would have been in the original base hospital

98
00:10:55,09 --> 00:11:03,05
and she was in karen dinner i think at the time was news that was carried on the net

99
00:11:03,05 --> 00:11:14,49
and there were also were we hospital where with i situated are you asking me too much now carry a martyr and.

100
00:11:14,49 --> 00:11:17,62
As a matter of fact i tried to get past where i thought the current you know was

101
00:11:17,62 --> 00:11:26,23
and i couldn't find that there was also the damn griles. Which was originally the ira social club.

102
00:11:26,23 --> 00:11:29,14
Because your mother in there was one hospital.

103
00:11:29,14 --> 00:11:39,64
But i can remember going to reno what was it like being the youngest of such a large family. Well i didn't.

104
00:11:39,64 --> 00:11:41,4
I wasn't spoiled.

105
00:11:41,4 --> 00:11:51,67
If that's what you're trying to get up here in but i certainly wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't much for anybody. So.

106
00:11:51,67 --> 00:12:00,66
Nothing nothing new you know really even just. Sometimes i reckon that i just grew up watching what would happen.

107
00:12:00,66 --> 00:12:05,25
Because there just wasn't home and i was sick when i was young and very sick

108
00:12:05,25 --> 00:12:11,9
and being the youngest didn't get you out of during any chores now and then i might. With the one that did that.

109
00:12:11,9 --> 00:12:18,02
He's since passed away he was killed in an accident in sydney in the net. Now.

110
00:12:18,02 --> 00:12:21,05
It was the money i could get away with anything i was too.

111
00:12:21,05 --> 00:12:28,71
Statman so i mean i didn't have a crawling body me but i mean. So i'm used to always get into trouble.

112
00:12:31,94 --> 00:12:38,64
Do you know it's but it was very nice decided it was affecting you and i do you remember much about your sister.

113
00:12:38,64 --> 00:12:44,22
I know you don't mean into the bad here but you know i'm not sure that you sister the now.

114
00:12:44,22 --> 00:12:51,66
And i mean that very well that was told to me she died when she was twenty i'd stay in the convent.

115
00:12:51,66 --> 00:12:56,32
What part of the highway where was she i think she was.

116
00:12:56,32 --> 00:13:02,17
When to write a match to she went into the convent she would be no debate today at seventeen you know.

117
00:13:02,17 --> 00:13:10,54
And then my mother had a big fight a grandfather and. She got in last night around.

118
00:13:10,54 --> 00:13:23,02
But then she really never entered into my life and prayed when did you make your husband run in a few days.

119
00:13:23,02 --> 00:13:29,92
To rejigger i remained for the game but i mean for me because i had to be sharp right

120
00:13:29,92 --> 00:13:35,69
and then my brother were going out of being a kind of the outward rather than being the g.

121
00:13:35,69 --> 00:13:48,61
Guy and i think i may be way better than your memories you know that i'm probably one of the many

122
00:13:48,61 --> 00:13:52,64
when i'm not a young child or there are a few young marines around.

123
00:13:52,64 --> 00:14:00,41
And i remember my sister and i think you know i mean you know you had to write a lot of anybody say about a guy

124
00:14:00,41 --> 00:14:09,51
and really just. I'm not happy about him coming i'm doing the right thing and even when i'm out of it.

125
00:14:09,9 --> 00:14:17,59
Let them not fight it went on man. We're going to be out here again.

126
00:14:17,59 --> 00:14:30,97
And really you know it would mean if you need to write a letter to me no matter when he was nineteen years old

127
00:14:30,97 --> 00:14:38,51
when you when you met your husband. And when i met him i was probably that sixteen.

128
00:14:38,51 --> 00:14:42,48
Man a man we thought a guy thinking of them when i was seventeen.

129
00:14:42,48 --> 00:14:50,2
Did you write and write years you couldn't go anywhere you not and i had with him that night

130
00:14:50,2 --> 00:14:57,26
and we're going to marry my dream may be greater than the brother. Come to that and.

131
00:14:57,26 --> 00:15:00,87
And i think i think you know i'm not going to think that's a.

132
00:15:00,87 --> 00:15:03,46
I'm not going to but dad

133
00:15:03,46 --> 00:15:08,82
and i really want to quoting the benefit of a nice five hundred eighteen i mean i mean they only draw a minimum

134
00:15:08,82 --> 00:15:12,01
and that it's great to have a maid and everything that happened.

135
00:15:12,01 --> 00:15:15,71
I think you bring a map to be in the front room on your way as you wrote on that

136
00:15:15,71 --> 00:15:22,7
or even history that you could run around the meat that you need and you didn't have any into the family farm

137
00:15:22,7 --> 00:15:31,66
and you know just great and it didn't matter that. But i mean you know that the getting found that a room.

138
00:15:31,66 --> 00:15:40,77
Were ripe for the young woman running into a young girl bragging to rome and going to read it from my padded. Radnor.

139
00:15:40,77 --> 00:15:51,12
And i think. I mean. We didn't get any way we didn't do anything but write any young people and i did a little around.

140
00:15:51,12 --> 00:15:54,79
Where we knew. My sister got married.

141
00:15:54,79 --> 00:16:03,34
Or we you know that and i dated five of them me when they met you know i did have a family. Driving on the brain.

142
00:16:03,34 --> 00:16:09,51
But we didn't have any makes me not you know. And a matter of fact i remember one time i did not have a.

143
00:16:10,49 --> 00:16:15,93
Sort of the brain that we used to buy i had graduated marang and.

144
00:16:15,93 --> 00:16:24,98
And she had asked me to go to the shire with and we made at the shop at a foundry. That i feel kind of right to have.

145
00:16:24,98 --> 00:16:28,21
I don't know that to me that i had to get rid of when my mother sister

146
00:16:28,21 --> 00:16:36,34
and i looked at her going to know that any right. It was the only lightly.

147
00:16:36,34 --> 00:16:42,7
For the rope and a great deal of weight and for that matter wouldn't a great deal of freedom and it was not one.

148
00:16:42,7 --> 00:16:48,93
Would be in had the thing to do you that you could know that i love raining i still love.

149
00:16:48,93 --> 00:16:56,08
Raining here with your five little. I don't have any private over that i grew up and i'm sure that story a good thing.

150
00:16:56,08 --> 00:17:00,16
My brothers left storybooks but they used to hide under the mattress and anyway.

151
00:17:00,16 --> 00:17:06,6
And i'll get a table of the right amount that i didn't find and sad at the thought that i made actually here.

152
00:17:06,6 --> 00:17:18,38
Except from school the tank books from the library. Rain that. You mentioned something about a band.

153
00:17:18,38 --> 00:17:23,87
I deny that kind of night out after we were married.

154
00:17:23,87 --> 00:17:32,09
About five it probably mattered if you know any amount if i got a bad night. For me there.

155
00:17:32,09 --> 00:17:38,06
And i thought we were married and you have to ask me about me waiting on you and i can act and.

156
00:17:38,06 --> 00:17:45,45
Married we want to leave the door when you can. And not have been and about that and i had planted bananas.

157
00:17:45,45 --> 00:17:47,7
And i got a laced with.

158
00:17:47,7 --> 00:17:56,56
Everyone had to do that and that man and i got the lace to run up to five years with a ten year option.

159
00:17:56,56 --> 00:18:04,82
I mean the main time we got married and. Five years wrap redeemed and the lawyer said.

160
00:18:04,82 --> 00:18:09,51
He met that wanted to get the option on it or not attain it.

161
00:18:10,27 --> 00:18:14,42
And i learned how to limit the end of the lane had not signed me up

162
00:18:14,42 --> 00:18:21,01
and i had an idea of the fact that a fifteen year let me out after five years.

163
00:18:21,01 --> 00:18:32,95
I had to prolong the plan to get at the plantation. And i believe that now runs out and i'm going to have.

164
00:18:32,95 --> 00:18:41,9
And you'll need me and i got it because he's a young man and the driver driving at wrecking made me happy.

165
00:18:41,9 --> 00:18:43,63
And i didn't find that option.

166
00:18:43,63 --> 00:18:55,22
And i'm a nice guy and i know that i believe you're right i mean that they could not put you up. I would probably be.

167
00:18:55,22 --> 00:19:03,98
I mean i boarded. I got you some compensation. But we needn't. We had delayed. And it was a lot of work.

168
00:19:03,98 --> 00:19:09,39
And i'm happy that the military have the final name to remember how many i think you are involved in that.

169
00:19:09,39 --> 00:19:17,38
We have been and i get that. And i get the bananas. All right at the heart of me. Yeah. I get the magic.

170
00:19:17,38 --> 00:19:21,8
Being engaged in a job. My dad needs.

171
00:19:21,8 --> 00:19:29,91
And in the meantime we have to run somewhere on my network and date and that was the last time.

172
00:19:29,91 --> 00:19:40,45
But of that we have to show you. I have now does have had already been shifting run to the store middle of july.

173
00:19:40,45 --> 00:19:45,52
And i have been in these i'm going out of the brain that i hate.

174
00:19:45,52 --> 00:19:47,63
But if i want to have this taken than alone

175
00:19:47,63 --> 00:19:54,34
but the one i did not wish to go on the ground trying to prove that they can

176
00:19:54,34 --> 00:19:59,75
and you know the very day that i live it might not matter and i took it down the road behind good.

177
00:19:59,75 --> 00:20:03,89
And yeah i mean you know good and rebuild but it's not actually demolished you know.

178
00:20:03,89 --> 00:20:12,58
Not in iraq that's what happened i took it away and rebuilt it. Thanks for bringing your own the original.

179
00:20:12,58 --> 00:20:20,22
And i think it was it with not developed at all of its net net net net net net net none of the bananagrams would have

180
00:20:20,22 --> 00:20:25,26
had it on the head to me and i don't have this. And that this with particularly nice bigger than.

181
00:20:25,26 --> 00:20:29,53
United in the sun may have been at the bottom line on the inside and now.

182
00:20:29,53 --> 00:20:34,26
Things which was right on me and i don't buy that many i behind it and.

183
00:20:34,26 --> 00:20:42,5
The really nice about it after about three years i think of the nation and for me it happened to me and i'm alive

184
00:20:42,5 --> 00:20:47,75
and i and eventually would need some named up.

185
00:20:47,75 --> 00:20:54,25
That i missed and i will just go with what many thought from where i live for i will not go

186
00:20:54,25 --> 00:20:59,45
or actually went to a fine school and i did a little down.

187
00:20:59,45 --> 00:21:07,32
And when i was having a band i did we really never remain silent the same as without the foundation.

188
00:21:07,32 --> 00:21:17,67
I know about a guy. And i did that or. I was with a friend then and i don't have a big you know.

189
00:21:17,67 --> 00:21:26,45
What did you need from run to the next and to risk their time.

190
00:21:26,45 --> 00:21:31,99
That you had never really had to write about it was trying to write right in front of the real. We've tried and tried.

191
00:21:31,99 --> 00:21:35,63
Because i think i might have had a few months.

192
00:21:35,63 --> 00:21:38,82
From a man of that that we had tried

193
00:21:38,82 --> 00:21:47,24
and then that's where we found it ever very high because it was just not a lot of people still didn't have a will to

194
00:21:47,24 --> 00:21:53,65
climb any really tenuous doors you telling me tonight along with his from nineteen year in and i think it was right

195
00:21:53,65 --> 00:21:58,01
and i went and he came from. And it was from you go on. And if that g.

196
00:21:58,01 --> 00:22:05,88
Got on with it we put a half up and i live with the love and love that about you now elaine.

197
00:22:05,88 --> 00:22:09,51
That we have maintained and that we would have left to build to have fun.

198
00:22:09,78 --> 00:22:17,9
But he said now he'd love us to know that they were banging out of there with nothing else we could do

199
00:22:17,9 --> 00:22:28,45
and that we put it up here in the meantime we're living in a tame kind of a time out of the time we started with the

200
00:22:28,45 --> 00:22:36,14
nineteenth. Of the good nature and he did it without a grain and with an answer and i started.

201
00:22:36,14 --> 00:22:47,95
You did not commit a felony. And even a little she was reading about how fat. I got and downy. I needed it. We painted.

202
00:22:47,95 --> 00:22:58,52
Kind of the night. Without you. But when i don't. And i have been have kind of man.

203
00:22:58,52 --> 00:23:06,5
Red he runs with red meat and we have got a little bit of the rain. But then it was in the lane behind.

204
00:23:06,5 --> 00:23:11,89
And i can remember the day that he thought i would run the drive the horses and in the little bit of the hill

205
00:23:11,89 --> 00:23:16,06
and know what was the first game i have been used. Maybe right or wrong.

206
00:23:16,06 --> 00:23:22,71
And i was the one that had to drive them in on the beginning not letting on a five dollar to tell you of that i had a

207
00:23:22,71 --> 00:23:28,42
high temperature. And i didn't have a lot of the doesn't have the matter. In the moment. And now.

208
00:23:28,42 --> 00:23:31,26
I can be just that we could run and we're going to do it.

209
00:23:31,26 --> 00:23:35,72
If there are we haven't had this one made me and i think that you never know

210
00:23:35,72 --> 00:23:42,41
when it's going to run you never know what the weather's going to do and of the back button of derived very little and.

211
00:23:42,41 --> 00:23:49,01
And a firm grasp of it and. The lean and proper in the ground.

212
00:23:49,01 --> 00:23:51,61
And i've done so here every now and then that he has you know

213
00:23:51,61 --> 00:24:03,45
and i think you had it in you know yes i know i mean right he have a plan. And i drove the federal republic on the run.

214
00:24:03,45 --> 00:24:14,96
Thank you and have said. It's been a happy one. We haven't and we got the bananas planted.

215
00:24:14,96 --> 00:24:24,1
And that would have been about six months. Not just a good man idea that we have planned.

216
00:24:24,1 --> 00:24:33,73
But we have to have very mixed up plans and that is that we haven't seen any..

217
00:24:29,6 --> 00:24:38,12
You know anything about it for a long length of the i.g. That we get our plans from the north of we would know.

218
00:24:38,12 --> 00:24:40,86
You would like to have a from anonymous.

219
00:24:40,86 --> 00:24:48,14
But respect they were not in that in the grove i've been on the run you some of that equipment a lot of damage to them

220
00:24:48,14 --> 00:24:56,83
and. It was early afternoon and there were a lot of again. With me having to run with counting down.

221
00:24:56,83 --> 00:24:59,82
And with your band down towards the river and you could.

222
00:24:59,82 --> 00:25:07,19
So you had rising and the river found i've been a fan of it it with an awful lot and to have you know.

223
00:25:07,19 --> 00:25:10,71
The rounding we're running headlong. I mean down. You know.

224
00:25:10,71 --> 00:25:15,98
Equivalent of you out of the ground you couldn't get any of the native revival. Bring it back.

225
00:25:15,98 --> 00:25:25,7
Just to win the war and then we went inside. And we thought i would have a cup of coffee but only about three o'clock.

226
00:25:25,7 --> 00:25:27,16
As we would making this coffee.

227
00:25:27,16 --> 00:25:35,98
We have this time in the back of the house and it was a home with the fact that we went through there.

228
00:25:35,98 --> 00:25:41,93
Where that man was in the back and we stood around a landslide have you know that he will

229
00:25:41,93 --> 00:25:51,09
but i'm going to get i thought of something that they feel that we're going to be going to do.

230
00:25:51,09 --> 00:25:56,95
And then you said we got me dying here and he said we have to get out of here i stand out of the hat.

231
00:25:56,95 --> 00:26:03,52
And he got the utility and we had a five and utility. And he got it out and put it on the right.

232
00:26:03,52 --> 00:26:11,04
I mean i've got a few things in the bag and a paper hang that he and me take that up into the. You know.

233
00:26:11,04 --> 00:26:18,05
And just don't leave us alone the rant about the biggest landslide going down in iraq just go ahead.

234
00:26:18,05 --> 00:26:26,88
And i just read on it and i've never seen it in the media. In the long run even thinking. And running.

235
00:26:26,88 --> 00:26:34,72
Kind of a run of the. Random have just come out right in front of me and a half eventually settled.

236
00:26:34,72 --> 00:26:40,00
I didn't get right on the ground because we had a few. Already gone. Rather than the night.

237
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:49,84
I was getting down to the ground. But. What have they not paying up when i don't have enough to be on into the night.

238
00:26:49,84 --> 00:26:53,97
And i know we got out and let me just but i would not be looking fine thing.

239
00:26:53,97 --> 00:27:03,62
Just me and i look back and i still might have but i really love them that would have been sitting you know not

240
00:27:03,62 --> 00:27:10,7
but it rained in the rain we were invited to a number of life threatening i didn't know anything i write. Going back.

241
00:27:10,7 --> 00:27:18,78
And we started making an ip next morning so i planned was out of that he finished and the sun was shining.

242
00:27:18,78 --> 00:27:19,49
And with that map

243
00:27:19,49 --> 00:27:27,17
and we went to the end of that we showed how the founder of the world for which i'm getting out of i think before would

244
00:27:27,17 --> 00:27:28,49
have been actually settled.

245
00:27:28,49 --> 00:27:36,38
Right down seventy five to me i mean damaging side with a few bits rather than have them out of the one man.

246
00:27:36,38 --> 00:27:42,38
And i have them out without a problem on the baby. Making. Retro.

247
00:27:42,38 --> 00:27:54,22
Means that anyone trying to look into a man will not reject kind again with the idea of storing it in.

248
00:27:54,22 --> 00:27:59,41
And he knew somebody had these to him and from the mean man. And you have done this before.

249
00:27:59,41 --> 00:28:05,75
And this time that you store bought. And i think you know. I think that. You know the real.

250
00:28:05,75 --> 00:28:09,51
Sort of thing to do but i have learned that i'm not really good.

251
00:28:09,52 --> 00:28:19,44
A lot of it in the heat and runs a guy not remembered when we don't have a clue we were living in a tank.

252
00:28:19,44 --> 00:28:23,5
And i threw him but i've learned getting out and trying to lure me a handful of the five

253
00:28:23,5 --> 00:28:31,45
and a frost on the way on the slide out in the out. Because i had to quit. And i mean it had to be a style that.

254
00:28:31,45 --> 00:28:35,05
And we set it up and i took the tank up.

255
00:28:35,05 --> 00:28:43,25
But after all it's running right you know for the one time that we had never worked on her and used to go out with.

256
00:28:43,25 --> 00:28:49,7
You know little creek road and then a fire right we put on a little bit. In this creek a little behind it in the house.

257
00:28:49,7 --> 00:28:54,97
And i lot left waiting with a lot of this time with some of the many seen.

258
00:28:54,97 --> 00:28:57,58
And a bit of family wood on the stimulus left and.

259
00:28:57,58 --> 00:29:05,41
I looked for them and then in the back and we just the right to live right.

260
00:29:05,41 --> 00:29:11,26
And it was nigh by routine i'd died that night anyway you couldn't get a life but you get help

261
00:29:11,26 --> 00:29:19,09
and you would have to borrow it. And i thought about this i mean we have one five gallon tank. And a tank.

262
00:29:19,09 --> 00:29:25,81
Have to last you for him a thing. So that when it got down to the night. We used to grover the last time.

263
00:29:25,81 --> 00:29:29,81
With the delighted when it was a night out about an assignment the roof.

264
00:29:29,81 --> 00:29:37,5
Which would be about three feet and right and used for rushing to the bathroom if you know. It had to mean.

265
00:29:37,5 --> 00:29:46,39
Just for the peach and then have time to have to make out and run somewhere else. So i will have a few crisis. Of the.

266
00:29:46,39 --> 00:29:53,00
Row. Jean-guy. It wasn't anything to write a little. When you have a line.

267
00:29:53,00 --> 00:29:55,33
And i just don't think it's going to break

268
00:29:55,33 --> 00:30:06,54
when i did write what i thought it was in such a position that we couldn't get it in the hands. But. Just went on and.

269
00:30:06,54 --> 00:30:16,91
We went on and on and we planted them right now. I know. And i've gotten out. And we had to go ahead.

270
00:30:16,91 --> 00:30:26,21
And i had the run up tonight it was too loud. And it got arrested for the love that it was nothing.

271
00:30:26,21 --> 00:30:28,54
And then eventually the bananas.

272
00:30:28,54 --> 00:30:36,33
Need to get better would be ending and it was my job to tie the knot in with the slide.

273
00:30:36,33 --> 00:30:40,94
And we have to agree need to hold the planning's and run with your little rock.

274
00:30:40,94 --> 00:30:43,38
I love to write about my husband for me

275
00:30:43,38 --> 00:30:51,31
but to give the other one lesson would be to make the thought that he would rather than me with this that he was

276
00:30:51,31 --> 00:30:53,5
writing and putting them on the road.

277
00:30:53,5 --> 00:31:01,55
And i was writing something that for people who might have never wanted to grow up

278
00:31:01,55 --> 00:31:09,71
and it ran through the been out of the flat going to get into the band stuff. Then of the shit.

279
00:31:09,71 --> 00:31:17,51
I've written down near the front of the sheet. And i move the nominee. And it and you have to try to get it behind.

280
00:31:17,51 --> 00:31:25,05
Right. I mean we have to go on but i'm glad i'm writing it and i don't.

281
00:31:25,05 --> 00:31:32,05
And you know we had not heard of you know we had in the main time of growth when we've been a good guy

282
00:31:32,05 --> 00:31:38,81
and we're expanding the half a night and a bubble of thanks tonight and i give you the money we handed me.

283
00:31:38,81 --> 00:31:44,2
In between the bananas which everybody needs actually been the man is right it's right for the brand with already got

284
00:31:44,2 --> 00:31:45,37
about it.

285
00:31:45,37 --> 00:31:51,51
That we've named names but you get a little bit of money to carry around many of the time and maybe that's

286
00:31:51,51 --> 00:31:58,02
when you have to buy right. And time money and i need now i know. And then of course when you buy right.

287
00:31:58,02 --> 00:32:03,17
You have to back it up and run with it.
