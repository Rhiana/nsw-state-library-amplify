1
00:00:11,74 --> 00:00:32,51
Yes. It's much less. Get your number right here. One would have hoped that.

2
00:00:32,51 --> 00:00:38,67
Folks settling in this community would have been enormously industrious. To build.

3
00:00:38,67 --> 00:00:44,73
Allow impact lyda man sustainable lifestyle. Planning perma culture across the hillsides.

4
00:00:44,73 --> 00:00:58,21
Vegetable gardens in the rich volcanic soil. Learning. Skills to support themselves a canonically.

5
00:00:58,21 --> 00:01:00,73
I've not done any scientific analysis of this

6
00:01:00,73 --> 00:01:07,23
but it seems to me a third of the people would make very little if any effort in those directions at all.

7
00:01:07,23 --> 00:01:18,24
Another third makes another third quite industrious. That's why one would have hoped because there's a crying need.

8
00:01:18,24 --> 00:01:29,28
Across the planet. For a low impact lyda man sustainable lifestyle. To reign in the arena successes and weist of.

9
00:01:29,28 --> 00:01:43,00
Rampant consumerism in the materialistic west. But also to show a viable y. Of fulfilling life to the impoverished.

10
00:01:43,00 --> 00:01:55,39
World. The sort of. Alternatives a saudi which exists in pockets in it around the region.

11
00:01:58,13 --> 00:02:10,59
Does bear these characteristics it does show a far future direction for planetary civilization. But that.

12
00:02:10,59 --> 00:02:11,01
Manifestation.

13
00:02:11,37 --> 00:02:21,83
It has been severely damaged by the one third who contribute nothing in one thirty you contribute only a little.

14
00:02:29,73 --> 00:02:46,09
As much. Well as a lawyer. I was i able to practice without fear of employment. And was unable to gain employment.

15
00:02:46,09 --> 00:02:50,45
Locally. Because of resentment from a very conservative profession.

16
00:02:51,11 --> 00:02:57,87
So i had to go out of the gulf coast to get a job and. Polish up my skills again.

17
00:02:57,87 --> 00:03:01,58
I have done that and couldn't move back now.

18
00:03:01,58 --> 00:03:06,35
Set up my own practice that lacks capital to really do so

19
00:03:06,35 --> 00:03:13,08
and will send the children to going to school on the gulf coast now. So lot of good things down here.

20
00:03:13,08 --> 00:03:20,99
Which are very attractive. Didn't close the mountains growing one's own food. The various aspects of.

21
00:03:20,99 --> 00:03:30,7
Alternative culture which are so positive like home birthing. The bush music scene. Alternative power.

22
00:03:30,7 --> 00:03:36,68
Alternative healing. It's a fun.

23
00:03:36,68 --> 00:03:43,42
It's a fun culture to live in and and develop a lot hocking back to what our saying earlier.

24
00:03:43,42 --> 00:03:50,13
I think that the welfare and the actions of. Black market.

25
00:03:50,13 --> 00:03:59,36
Marijuana growing and dealing with has had a spin off with a considerable portion of. Of heroin users and.

26
00:03:59,36 --> 00:04:09,23
What pad a spin it fetter mean type uses. Of the downside of that. Positive culture.

27
00:04:09,23 --> 00:04:17,09
Of course those downsides exist through. At society there. I haven't just limited to this one. That.

28
00:04:17,09 --> 00:04:25,09
The shame of it is the enormous. National and planetary need for this sort of.

29
00:04:25,09 --> 00:04:29,88
Now impact light amount lost all of the evidence in a fairly positive. Why.

30
00:04:32,15 --> 00:04:39,78
And one would have hoped after twenty years. A lot more would have been achieved and has been.

31
00:04:49,77 --> 00:04:58,05
I found it at the time rather. Airy fairy and. He hated mystic.

32
00:04:58,05 --> 00:05:03,37
But i hoped that people would be able to implement that idealism into.

33
00:05:03,37 --> 00:05:14,96
Nuts and bolts reality of homes and what should and local industries and craft. The first five or ten years.

34
00:05:18,13 --> 00:05:24,99
Folk would say oh we're shell shocked from being in the world at so we need to turn inwards and observe night sure

35
00:05:24,99 --> 00:05:31,3
and get some sort of centering on what we're going to do and why. And i kept saying that for another five years.

36
00:05:31,3 --> 00:05:41,22
I think after twenty years. With really got to bridge the gap between the intellectual ideals.

37
00:05:41,22 --> 00:05:51,18
And the nuts and bolts physical reality. You know strider which is going down the should be economically.

38
00:05:51,18 --> 00:06:01,25
That's not good enough to keep putting one's hand out to the public purse. No doubt.

39
00:06:01,25 --> 00:06:09,97
There's a horrific rich poor gap in australia. Which justifies the. Economically. Underprivileged sections.

40
00:06:09,97 --> 00:06:16,78
Receiving some. Well fair. No doubt. The receipt of that welfare.

41
00:06:16,78 --> 00:06:26,42
Relieves revolutionary type pressure on that ten percent which controls not a descent of the wealth.

42
00:06:26,42 --> 00:06:27,26
Welfare is a good

43
00:06:27,26 --> 00:06:37,17
and just thing in the present economic arrangement that once criticism must go to the present political economic

44
00:06:37,17 --> 00:06:44,02
arrangement. It's preserving. This rich poor that. It's preserving a.

45
00:06:44,02 --> 00:06:58,59
Enormous weist of energy in government and bureaucracy. It's my thesis that by adopting a body centralized system.

46
00:06:58,59 --> 00:07:06,71
With political power maximized in local areas and. Economic independence.

47
00:07:06,71 --> 00:07:20,03
Maximized as much as possible in local areas so as to obviate the need for transportation. So a lot of this.

48
00:07:20,03 --> 00:07:34,7
Wastage of money on. Central government and. The concentration of wealth in a few hands can be avoided.

49
00:07:34,7 --> 00:07:41,43
This is sink a simple one simple answer to a stranger's economic political imbalance.

50
00:07:41,43 --> 00:07:51,83
And that is to replace all taxation. With site revenue. So it revenue should be the sole source of public finance.

51
00:07:51,83 --> 00:07:58,39
Site revenue is a collection of the yeah new all right all value of sites privately occupied with various sorts be on

52
00:07:58,39 --> 00:08:11,01
the air and water oil. Whether those sites be used for residence. Commercial industrial. Public or any other use.

53
00:08:11,41 --> 00:08:16,1
Sites which should be free of paying site revenue. Would be to.

54
00:08:16,1 --> 00:08:29,56
Then which is truly open to the public at any time such as roads. National parks beaches. Land which is held by.

55
00:08:29,56 --> 00:08:37,58
Government bodies such as. Ministries or local government including church land. All of that.

56
00:08:37,58 --> 00:08:42,3
Should pay the annual rental value of the site occupied. To the community.

57
00:08:42,3 --> 00:08:48,91
This would force stay on the price of land such that. Land would eventually transfer.

58
00:08:48,91 --> 00:08:53,32
Only for the value of improvements upon it. This would.

59
00:08:53,32 --> 00:08:56,42
Be severe disincentive to people earning more land than they have to.

60
00:08:57,36 --> 00:09:01,78
Would make a lot of land available for the present unemployed.

61
00:09:01,78 --> 00:09:11,71
Folk to settle and pineal survive a lot of stalls like their forefathers did. Because workers would have this choice.

62
00:09:11,71 --> 00:09:22,38
Of independence. On their own. Smallholding. So there'd be. Competition for labor and.

63
00:09:22,38 --> 00:09:29,66
Rewards for lybia would naturally be high without the necessity for union action.

64
00:09:35,34 --> 00:09:55,27
No longer would there be the massive imposts upon. Effort and creativity. Which income tax payer of tax stamp duties..

65
00:09:46,41 --> 00:09:59,66
Financial institution taxes. And horror of horrors a proposed g.s.t. Embroil. In the industrious person in suffering.

66
00:10:10,76 --> 00:10:28,32
That's a simple solution. Sought revenue. That's right. And i did. This been great advances on various cultural fronts.

67
00:10:30,13 --> 00:10:38,82
Such as community based preschool ing and primary schooling. Birthing. Bush music. Alternative power.

68
00:10:43,07 --> 00:10:55,7
There are good examples of perma culture. And so subsistence. I'd say it's gone. A decent. Why down the track in.

69
00:10:55,7 --> 00:11:04,92
Evidencing what's possible. Although to me personally the. Progress has been. Saddening only in adequate.

70
00:11:04,92 --> 00:11:25,35
Where we shouldn't could have been at this time. Reality and. Yes it could it could. It could be.

71
00:11:25,35 --> 00:11:36,63
The hard knocks is this really. It is difficult to struggle with inadequate capital to build and plant.

72
00:11:36,63 --> 00:11:48,78
It's so easy to getting caught up in the effort of day to day living. Family tensions.

73
00:11:48,78 --> 00:12:03,35
The sheer problems of living hard in an area like this with without. Often without electricity and with heavy rainfall.

74
00:12:03,35 --> 00:12:10,17
Many people can't afford. The basic price of a share in land. Which is usually gone.

75
00:12:10,5 --> 00:12:16,34
Beyond the original two hundred dollars which title was timed cuttable is now about twelve or fifteen hundred.

76
00:12:16,34 --> 00:12:27,34
With difficult conditions of approval to be met before. Any shares granted.

77
00:12:27,34 --> 00:12:35,08
Really they could and should have been dozens or. Or scores of large scale community settlements like tangible.

78
00:12:35,08 --> 00:12:41,36
That the high price of land has made that. Difficult. There was one effort. Several years ago.

79
00:12:41,36 --> 00:12:52,17
Tire mcadory on the cayuga road where the south wales. Department of. Think it was housing. Assisted in setting up or.

80
00:12:52,17 --> 00:13:02,27
Allow impact. Type. Community with with subsidised share prices which could be paid back.

81
00:13:02,27 --> 00:13:11,15
Over a period even by someone receiving welfare. And fortunately that whole exercise. Was severely damaged by.

82
00:13:11,15 --> 00:13:13,84
One element of settlers who wanted to grow marijuana.

83
00:13:13,84 --> 00:13:21,06
Which was obviously contrary to the mandate of franchise the state government had entrusted to those steering the

84
00:13:21,06 --> 00:13:31,37
community. And then it was a change of government and the south wales liberals quickly ended the adventure that.

85
00:13:31,37 --> 00:13:41,72
To answer your question. There's a lot of physical difficulties in fulfilling the ideals.

86
00:13:41,72 --> 00:13:52,54
That in a world which is suffering such threats to its continued existence. From pollution. Poverty unemployment.

87
00:13:52,54 --> 00:14:03,03
Economic illness. It's incumbent upon. Every one of us to keep those ideals in mind. Do our best to achieve it.

88
00:14:03,03 --> 00:14:21,34
And not cut down. As being. Abnormally tall poppies. Other individuals who. Exhort folk to i aim at those ideals.

89
00:14:21,34 --> 00:14:26,21
And even.

90
00:14:26,21 --> 00:14:42,37
Exhort them to cease wasting the potentials we have such crying planetary and national need to achieve those ideals.

91
00:14:44,76 --> 00:14:51,06
Well i think my favorite memory happens every dawn and dusk. When stillness. Descends on the valley and.

92
00:14:51,06 --> 00:15:14,69
The goods and the incredible variety and richness call the clear sounds back and forth. Like something. Yes definitely.

93
00:15:14,69 --> 00:15:26,16
At the bend alex. Attracted me here to settle.

94
00:15:26,16 --> 00:15:34,62
You may be aware that bet me out warnings the highest mountain in the strider that receives the first sunlight of adorn

95
00:15:34,62 --> 00:15:44,19
touching this continent. And it's a plug of an ancient park. The rim of that ultra ancient volcanoes the nightcap.

96
00:15:44,19 --> 00:15:47,61
Range here in the south where tuttle billie's the tweed range in the west

97
00:15:47,61 --> 00:15:53,36
and the macpherson range on the queensland border. So if you look at it.

98
00:15:53,36 --> 00:15:59,39
On a broad scale contour map you'll see a veritable circle of mountains.

99
00:15:59,39 --> 00:16:10,18
Centered on mount warning so for twenty years i saw this is actually a man dialect across which and you are.

100
00:16:11,03 --> 00:16:17,22
Civilization could be built and. Demonstrating a valuable.

101
00:16:17,22 --> 00:16:54,13
Way of life for the rest of the nation and the guard in that case. There is an infinite consciousness.

102
00:16:54,13 --> 00:17:21,45
Some might call it god i think jesus christ was a true individual who to the highest extent embodied that consciousness

103
00:17:21,45 --> 00:17:36,16
is not something one can intellectualize very well. That living close to nature. They're going one's own food.

104
00:17:38,36 --> 00:17:56,23
Yeah i've been happy. And felt at peace with the universe and. That's all the spiritual insight i require. Thank you.

105
00:17:56,23 --> 00:18:09,65
Ok take six hundred ninety nine and. They're kind of thinking about what is it. He says. Health care your life and.

106
00:18:09,65 --> 00:18:25,96
Someone tell me it's. I mean a nation for a sewer. Stright you or. I can name in soft technology engineers texas.

107
00:18:25,96 --> 00:18:31,17
Kallie mclaughlin. And i'm very busy working for run by power at the moment.

108
00:18:31,17 --> 00:18:37,35
But i still live in this community as i've done for nineteen years now. But if you and.

109
00:18:37,35 --> 00:18:43,78
I first came to nimbin for the queerest festival. When i came up with a wonderful contingent of ten.

110
00:18:43,78 --> 00:18:49,49
Hippies from mina sydney. And we brought with us a prefabricated dime. And put it up on the paddock.

111
00:18:49,49 --> 00:18:53,18
The side of newman. And we had an unbelievably amazing two weeks.

112
00:18:53,18 --> 00:19:00,92
It was sort of like a dry run for what could be possible in the wife. Soft technology. And it worked nicely.

113
00:19:01,72 --> 00:19:08,9
What a wonderful time. And the. The bamboo and plastic done which is quite big.

114
00:19:08,9 --> 00:19:13,75
We eventually thatched tightly and with setting on it made it perfectly respectable building.

115
00:19:13,83 --> 00:19:20,87
We had a fall place in the middle and. Mets all around it. And it was a bit like a tape.

116
00:19:20,87 --> 00:19:33,26
Buckminster fuller tape it was a concept that you know. Music was a bit of that broke revolve all things starting and.

117
00:19:33,26 --> 00:19:41,37
Also the celtic revival. And there's a great spirit. Of ancient. Momentum. That was happening at that stage and.

118
00:19:41,37 --> 00:19:49,5
We had a in anderson from the doors playing bach. Minuets interspersed with brock music it was. I guess you'd call it.

119
00:19:49,5 --> 00:19:57,87
Broken celtic infusion of the rock music which is a driving anti society force at that stage.

120
00:19:57,87 --> 00:20:03,83
And being a musician of some sort also extremely interested. And attracted by this expression of culture.

121
00:20:04,67 --> 00:20:12,55
The idea was to somehow. Have the best of city culture. While the best of country. Environment.

122
00:20:12,55 --> 00:20:16,54
And if you could some help and expect to get that then you'd be really in paradise.

123
00:20:17,56 --> 00:20:25,55
And on top of that goes the odd deal of political autonomy. The been a lot of political repression at this stage.

124
00:20:25,55 --> 00:20:33,04
And very much this utopian movement of the sixty's and seventy's was a response to political repression.

125
00:20:33,04 --> 00:20:39,45
A lot of very strong. Notions. In the white legislature at that stage was set up and.

126
00:20:39,45 --> 00:20:45,26
Most of us had been on the wrong side of the war either. Everything from drinking in public smoke marijuana.

127
00:20:45,26 --> 00:20:56,15
Right through to conscription. So we had very little time three. Establishment. Odd loral policed. As you can.

128
00:20:56,15 --> 00:21:07,58
Also totally respectable mathematics teacher. Tried to become a physicist. And i wasn't quite in the top notch.

129
00:21:07,58 --> 00:21:10,02
Group of students enough to to achieve that.

130
00:21:10,02 --> 00:21:13,67
I ended up becoming a teacher is the anyway financing myself through university.

131
00:21:14,08 --> 00:21:18,2
I became a teacher but not a very good one. Eventually decided that.

132
00:21:18,2 --> 00:21:28,37
Educating people for destructive and nonexistent jobs. Was you know. Limited potential. I thought that.

133
00:21:28,37 --> 00:21:34,75
Create a changing things much more fundamentally than simply in educating people in school to tolerate the system was

134
00:21:34,75 --> 00:21:49,12
more practical. Not long. And six months i came here to live. Since the festival i'd start.

135
00:21:49,12 --> 00:21:54,79
Actually before the festival i decided i was going to live in the north in rivers coming in any questions which one.

136
00:21:54,79 --> 00:21:59,44
I've been up in a lens which is right close to my home. Looking to settle in there.

137
00:21:59,44 --> 00:22:02,99
And didn't feel very welcome at any of the.

138
00:22:02,99 --> 00:22:07,18
Communes which were being set up up and down the coast at that time in the querist movement.

139
00:22:07,18 --> 00:22:10,18
Had much more political strength and integrity to it.

140
00:22:10,28 --> 00:22:17,21
Any of the previous which were really just like extended family groups. And for that reason i joined this commune.

141
00:22:19,49 --> 00:22:26,07
It was beak. Had a certain inertia to it. That meant that.

142
00:22:26,07 --> 00:22:32,89
Personality issues didn't end up dominating the politics and the audiology and. In that why. The political process.

143
00:22:32,89 --> 00:22:37,14
And the corporate structure of this place were very superior to anything else which it happened.

144
00:22:37,31 --> 00:22:51,64
They get much more rights to the individual. Is that you. Know. Because it was never explicitly applied.

145
00:22:52,55 --> 00:22:57,83
I think i can think of many cases where this community only stayed together because of its political structure.

146
00:22:57,83 --> 00:23:00,12
And there are lots of parallels with other.

147
00:23:00,12 --> 00:23:04,27
Communes at the same time which didn't have the political structure which fell apart.

148
00:23:04,52 --> 00:23:10,4
And when the necessary conflicts of interest turned up. There was the form. And the communication.

149
00:23:10,4 --> 00:23:15,52
In this coming in to to sort out things. So when we. We faced. All of the.

150
00:23:15,52 --> 00:23:25,63
The big issues that any intentional community faces. Which is work obligations. Impact on.

151
00:23:25,63 --> 00:23:34,85
Sharing resources and ironically that gets translated into reality is. Guns. Dogs and fences.

152
00:23:37,17 --> 00:23:42,17
That's the bottom line of a conflict. Often.

153
00:23:42,17 --> 00:23:46,01
That's just a symptom of the underlying conflict but that's what always bubbles out.

154
00:23:46,01 --> 00:23:51,48
And our community did a better job of managing those set. Subjects than many of the others with less structure.

155
00:23:56,35 --> 00:24:07,48
You took. Yes. Yes. And then. Politics and politics were not.

156
00:24:07,48 --> 00:24:12,38
Issues that the corporate structure of the commune dealt with. Regional issues. Is that.

157
00:24:12,38 --> 00:24:18,95
I think possibly for that reason i got much more nasty. And more involved with personal power politics.

158
00:24:18,95 --> 00:24:25,8
Rather than with. Overall principles and god lance. And.

159
00:24:25,8 --> 00:24:31,31
The seems to me is where the individual comes up against the community i think when issues of water

160
00:24:31,31 --> 00:24:36,87
and diaper involved and. Death of course was a financial ticket.

161
00:24:36,87 --> 00:24:45,32
It was a very quick and easy way of getting money which was the thing which is my short in supply here. And.

162
00:24:45,32 --> 00:24:51,3
The dole was equally powerful. But that didn't really in pins nearly so much on the community structure.

163
00:24:51,3 --> 00:24:59,72
Was water and both were strong incentives for people to work in an actively. Anti social matter. For their own games.

164
00:24:59,72 --> 00:25:10,81
And that's what happened. So i think so yes. With water. It was come.

165
00:25:10,81 --> 00:25:15,86
Compounded by the fact that most people don't understand how water works. It's intellectually difficult.

166
00:25:17,16 --> 00:25:21,2
Particularly for people with di paddled brians. And i think most of the.

167
00:25:21,2 --> 00:25:27,93
What is seen as like an unbelievable self interest. Was actually not quite as simple as that but.

168
00:25:27,93 --> 00:25:36,39
Really a combination of self interest. And confusion. And a tendency to paranoia.

169
00:25:36,39 --> 00:25:42,19
Others you soon that is there's no water she was full of rotten because it's now locked in the pot and.

170
00:25:42,19 --> 00:25:48,12
I think it's something deep in human nature to. When our fundamental resources are threatened or the land or water.

171
00:25:48,57 --> 00:25:55,96
We immediately. Try to blame somebody rather than to look at what the real problem is it's instinctive and.

172
00:25:55,96 --> 00:26:01,43
People tended to have a lot of always hear first talk of no mentality. Picu thwart.

173
00:26:01,43 --> 00:26:06,47
The shift to a place where there was a reliable stream. And then be unwilling to share it.

174
00:26:06,47 --> 00:26:14,38
Not realizing that water is really very much a public property. I mean even one stream astrologer it's public property.

175
00:26:14,38 --> 00:26:26,27
Except at west we can bond so water rights. But that. You can't just sort of grab water. Toms and.

176
00:26:28,46 --> 00:26:31,07
All right from the beginning. I saw a problem.

177
00:26:31,07 --> 00:26:37,62
In that people were taken out of a war and called a fully serviced environment in the suburbs and.

178
00:26:37,62 --> 00:26:42,6
Dropped in very beautiful surroundings but. Surroundings in which nearly all the fundamental surfaces were missing.

179
00:26:43,94 --> 00:26:55,7
And suddenly the issues of. Well let's run through them. There's no sewage pipes. No water pipes. No roads.

180
00:26:55,7 --> 00:27:04,96
No phone lines. No electricity. Like i think i've run through five. Fundamental services all missing.

181
00:27:06,26 --> 00:27:11,45
And it was very difficult for people to accommodate to the. Enormous sudden drop in the standard of living.

182
00:27:12,47 --> 00:27:19,66
And the bus psychologically unprepared and physically unprepared to take that step back in servicing level.

183
00:27:20,75 --> 00:27:25,8
And i could run through each one of those fov services and the mess ups that happens the result of people's.

184
00:27:25,8 --> 00:27:31,27
Attempts to get a wife to do without them. And that i think is the story.

185
00:27:31,27 --> 00:27:35,8
Of this community as much as a political story as much as a social story.

186
00:27:35,8 --> 00:27:38,39
The story of the effect of withdrawal of services from people.

187
00:27:41,03 --> 00:27:48,69
One instinct like of just mentioned is that people fought for what he used. So you get power politics into a trip out.

188
00:27:49,91 --> 00:27:54,6
Politics. By stay on the. The roads. The electricity which is here.

189
00:27:55,08 --> 00:27:58,69
And the other side of this you get people suffering terrible.

190
00:27:58,69 --> 00:28:02,25
Depreciation for not knowing how to get around the lack of those services.

191
00:28:02,25 --> 00:28:08,51
In the first year we had a lot of the human life by being expended carrying. Containers of water up hills.

192
00:28:09,83 --> 00:28:10,18
People didn't.

193
00:28:10,57 --> 00:28:15,48
Realize that it was actually abundant water at high altitude he it's just a question of knowing how to pocket.

194
00:28:15,77 --> 00:28:17,39
But that. Total lack of skill.

195
00:28:17,39 --> 00:28:24,03
Of dealing with fundamental resources and how to supply them for yourself caused an awful lot of suffering.

196
00:28:24,03 --> 00:28:32,43
You know saying those things are enormous. We had houses but down by people using candles.

197
00:28:32,43 --> 00:28:39,76
We had first to tell you on the property i think was a baby but to death that was a second wasn't it.

198
00:28:39,76 --> 00:28:45,78
Anyway the point is that we had deaths. We had great suffering caused by people not knowing how to do without services.

199
00:28:45,85 --> 00:28:52,15
And this is all totally foreseeable and expectable. Selective electricity caused people to get burnt to death.

200
00:28:53,74 --> 00:29:02,05
Lack of communication. Caused people to dos night but that's not telephones. Like of roads cause people to dog many.

201
00:29:02,05 --> 00:29:11,49
Mel nutrition in a couple of examples and. This not death also i was related to lack of pride's.

202
00:29:11,49 --> 00:29:21,25
Lack of sewage caused hepatitis at. Outbreak. I think one person died of that. Lack of.

203
00:29:21,25 --> 00:29:26,34
I've gone through them all like a board it caused unbelievable problems again with health.

204
00:29:26,34 --> 00:29:38,94
And with you tonight of a conflict. So it's coming. Oh well. I came from a very practical background.

205
00:29:38,94 --> 00:29:47,05
Because my father was a farmer and my training was only in physics and science and otherwise been a mechanic

206
00:29:47,05 --> 00:29:56,12
and things like that. So i thought i came here with a very good schools price. Given a few rude shocks.

207
00:29:56,12 --> 00:29:58,76
Early on by the difficulty of making services work.

208
00:29:59,21 --> 00:30:03,85
The first thing i did was run up a water pipe and found that water would not run downhill through a pipe.

209
00:30:03,85 --> 00:30:08,19
That was a bit of a shock to my conception of how the world works. Once i learned why.

210
00:30:08,99 --> 00:30:13,27
It was a bit of a learning curve. With nearly everything. Everything you have to do.

211
00:30:13,27 --> 00:30:20,77
It took a little while to get through those early setbacks. But soon we learnt to run. Water down pops.

212
00:30:20,77 --> 00:30:27,01
That all started working nicely and.

213
00:30:27,01 --> 00:30:40,93
That's been the story really is the last twenty years gradually getting alternative services going on your life like.

214
00:30:40,93 --> 00:30:51,8
Getting it right for me. You know. I actually got an interest in run by power. After the failure of my.

215
00:30:51,8 --> 00:31:02,09
If it's to try and provide service into this intentional community. I great plans for that for doing. Soft. Impact.

216
00:31:02,09 --> 00:31:10,6
Transport. Water electricity supplies for the community and. I would call. Most of that as a fad yeah.

217
00:31:11,04 --> 00:31:17,73
Partly the fault for under mr underestimating the difficulties. Partly that are the fault of just not enough capital.

218
00:31:17,73 --> 00:31:23,92
Partly the fault of people not having confidence that these things could work and. The real.
