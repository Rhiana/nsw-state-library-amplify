1
00:00:09,39 --> 00:01:05,4
Arwa. But that's how the pedals. This is the. I do get a young child now so i do hu washing every few days.

2
00:01:05,4 --> 00:01:10,82
Nappies and stuff. As you can see it going to throw but washing machine here and a yeah. It has been dry.

3
00:01:11,86 --> 00:01:18,53
And i you know i've experimented with them. With paper washing machines but those knew of it.

4
00:01:18,53 --> 00:01:25,36
Terribly happy with him because. You couldn't walk away from it. You know you were totally involved in the wash.

5
00:01:25,36 --> 00:01:32,03
And you had to be there for the entire education of the boy. With a twelve washing machine i could just turn it on.

6
00:01:32,03 --> 00:01:36,05
Walk away. When the washing finished i just come back.

7
00:01:36,05 --> 00:01:40,9
Take the washing out the washing machine throw it into the paper spin dry that there has been dry is great because i

8
00:01:40,9 --> 00:01:49,76
just get up to speed takes about fifteen seconds is paid lip to speed. And you just it's been you know. It's.

9
00:01:49,76 --> 00:01:55,78
The pedal spin dry is actually quite a bit they the saving devices set you mean it's still doing itself this of all the

10
00:01:55,78 --> 00:02:02,92
easier than having to ring in the last you know that really well. And you get this legs in the business.

11
00:02:04,37 --> 00:02:08,23
Yeah well i've not pedaling as much as i used to having a thing.

12
00:02:08,46 --> 00:02:20,04
I find that i can do all the shopping on the bicycle so i tend to make use of it. Now i've got a cat that runs on gas.

13
00:02:20,04 --> 00:02:26,34
It's not this polluting as with most vehicles that. I am relying on on the. To do shopping and stuff.

14
00:02:26,34 --> 00:02:37,79
It's not getting as much use to do. What other things if you ask. Here i'll show you some of the stuff later.

15
00:02:37,79 --> 00:02:44,04
As you can see this is a pedal spin dryer and on the other side. A multi purpose better machine a high speed.

16
00:02:44,04 --> 00:02:50,94
Machine it's basically just a very clean man to check. Through a bench top and.

17
00:02:51,65 --> 00:02:59,9
That's been dry here by the way it's been thirty five to one. So every time the pedals go round once.

18
00:02:59,9 --> 00:03:12,99
This been dry goes around thirty five times. The that. The pedal. The multi-speed. That's going to seventy two and.

19
00:03:12,99 --> 00:03:18,81
For every time that there was going around one seat. Jack at the top spin seventy times.

20
00:03:18,81 --> 00:03:26,46
That means that pedaling at the rate of a comfortable pedaling rate is probably hundred hundred twenty. At the end.

21
00:03:26,46 --> 00:03:46,52
That made it that things doing. That eighty eight thousand. Pretty good output. It works really well. Ok. Yes.

22
00:03:46,52 --> 00:03:56,06
This is the all the speed. Story. The multipurpose high speed pedal machinist don't you have enough.

23
00:03:56,06 --> 00:03:57,24
You can see he's got one.

24
00:03:57,24 --> 00:04:00,77
Going to really force it to china's own

25
00:04:00,77 --> 00:04:10,86
and so forth to figuring it out to speed it up from the pedals all the way up to the. F. Brad just to stop you.

26
00:04:10,86 --> 00:04:20,28
So this is giving me a seventy one year i says i was saying before they were no speed up.

27
00:04:20,28 --> 00:04:25,82
You can see it's just going to the whole of the state now. I reckon i can get it from you have to bet.

28
00:04:25,82 --> 00:04:33,25
Then they haven't read you by showing you what sort of morsels would come out of you.

29
00:04:33,25 --> 00:04:41,99
Sort of things would you use it for this is what i've got them here at the moment is a. Juice a blended base.

30
00:04:41,99 --> 00:04:47,72
So i can just produce or a blender something on top of it but underneath here it's a very clear mandate.

31
00:04:48,88 --> 00:04:51,51
So i can put a check into that.

32
00:04:51,51 --> 00:04:53,09
Take this off

33
00:04:53,09 --> 00:05:01,26
and put anything i like onto it because it's with a very can manage check you can get any that say anything.

34
00:05:01,26 --> 00:05:07,91
Driven by an electric motor that say hopefully with a mode of bent out so you can have a good excuse to pull up the

35
00:05:07,91 --> 00:05:15,02
pieces. And you just keep it down or you strip the major down until just after the drive.

36
00:05:15,02 --> 00:05:18,17
And you just insert the drive shaft into the check.

37
00:05:18,17 --> 00:05:22,93
Save an instantly turn but used to be an electrical apparatus into a mechanical driven apparatus.

38
00:05:24,84 --> 00:05:28,6
What about the rest of the house. Well.

39
00:05:29,09 --> 00:05:34,85
A lot of people seem to get the idea when they hear about me that i run everything with better pair but i don't.

40
00:05:35,47 --> 00:05:43,69
I use paper power. Mostly for. Direct mechanical conversion like that at least in machines i just showed you.

41
00:05:43,69 --> 00:05:53,36
All my other pair is just better based electricity. Going to better bank gets jash by solar panels. System.

42
00:05:53,36 --> 00:06:06,67
And a couple of small bicycle when to. How long ago since you paid an electricity bill. G. Twenty years.

43
00:06:09,37 --> 00:06:14,79
I think i would have saved many many thousands of dollars and. Do so.

44
00:06:14,79 --> 00:06:23,41
Do you develop sort of prototypes that eventually end up in products that are right that.

45
00:06:23,41 --> 00:06:28,59
I haven't done that for a while i have developed a few predator quite some time ago but most of the research

46
00:06:28,59 --> 00:06:34,89
and development with iran but that is now done by other people i tend to be full time involved with. That with.

47
00:06:34,89 --> 00:06:46,92
Writing stuff and. And communicating with clients and stuff. Yeah. I'm paid a pedals.

48
00:06:48,29 --> 00:06:52,14
I was instrumental in the whole of things in the and of course lately.

49
00:06:52,14 --> 00:06:59,34
With the setting up with it with the whole concept behind the rain but then a company that was my idea.

50
00:06:59,91 --> 00:07:08,75
But before then. I set up. And film society in in. Stablish than in the news.

51
00:07:08,75 --> 00:07:19,27
Which you probably know about the local rag and. I was very instrumental in setting up. The stad office being rainbow.

52
00:07:19,27 --> 00:07:41,19
Which is now become the nimbin neighborhood sand. Plus a whole lot of other things i guess. Between in between and.

53
00:07:41,19 --> 00:07:52,06
Yeah. I was straddling. For a number of years i came back to a stray a year in seventy one seventy two.

54
00:07:52,06 --> 00:07:59,21
And then i heard on the grapevine that there was a festival in the offing in the mini area and.

55
00:07:59,21 --> 00:08:03,38
I had lost as overseas i'd heard lots of bad. The.

56
00:08:03,38 --> 00:08:07,45
Woodstock festival and some big festivals in europe and stuff and i thought this is be graded.

57
00:08:07,45 --> 00:08:14,4
Wouldn't mind going to that. Best of all. I get my ears to the ground and.

58
00:08:14,4 --> 00:08:19,84
Found out exactly when and where it was and i think it was may seventy three was and when the festival was held

59
00:08:19,84 --> 00:08:27,76
and i came up here and had a really great time and decided that this would be actually be the place to live you know.

60
00:08:27,76 --> 00:08:33,00
I had traveled up and then use the coast of australia i actually traveled throughout most of the strain.

61
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:38,45
And with that with the idea of working out where i'd really like to live and.

62
00:08:38,45 --> 00:08:43,4
Once i'd been at the festival here decided this be the place for me so. I went away.

63
00:08:43,4 --> 00:08:53,34
To sydney for a few years to try and just a lot of money to buy some land and set myself up. Didn't get very fat.

64
00:08:53,34 --> 00:08:58,99
Just say more stories and more you earn the fast you spend.

65
00:08:58,99 --> 00:09:03,48
I decided to come back anyway after a couple of years and said lynn neary

66
00:09:03,48 --> 00:09:11,45
and soon as i got here i made getting myself involved in community projects.

67
00:09:13,59 --> 00:09:19,43
When i was in sydney i was involved with down to a drop in center in paddington.

68
00:09:19,43 --> 00:09:23,09
And i did all sorts of things there including showing films and stuff to people

69
00:09:23,09 --> 00:09:34,39
and bought some projector equipment stuff with me and then been in the decided to stay with the set up a film.

70
00:09:34,39 --> 00:09:48,14
And film. And i did that for quite some time. Showing films. Every week. For a couple of years.

71
00:09:48,14 --> 00:09:54,38
And i found that there was very poor communications in this area. And there's people.

72
00:09:54,38 --> 00:09:56,69
You know there's lots of music music goes into syria.

73
00:09:57,23 --> 00:10:02,49
Lots of people doing all sorts of entertainment but mostly musicians.

74
00:10:02,49 --> 00:10:08,23
And i always found that there was a to nothing happening at all where everybody was doing their thing all of the.

75
00:10:08,37 --> 00:10:09,48
Same time. You know.

76
00:10:09,48 --> 00:10:12,37
And it was always a great conflict everybody wanted to go do everything at once

77
00:10:12,37 --> 00:10:16,49
and of course some people ended up missing out and you know.

78
00:10:17,06 --> 00:10:24,68
And i thought this is crazy we've got to do something about this. So i set up the news.

79
00:10:24,68 --> 00:10:28,13
Dextrostat off being the name in news letter. And they don't know.

80
00:10:28,13 --> 00:10:35,59
So i was to drop off a letter and just make it in the news but the it was just starting off as a just a few new sheets.

81
00:10:35,59 --> 00:10:45,01
Giving information to people that what's happening in the local area. And again that was something i did.

82
00:10:45,01 --> 00:10:49,98
Once a week every week so as soon as i got here i made myself pretty busy you know doing all these things.

83
00:10:49,98 --> 00:10:57,52
But that worked really well had a great following with a name in news and.

84
00:10:57,52 --> 00:11:01,86
People were a lot better informed about who was doing what and when and where.

85
00:11:01,86 --> 00:11:09,63
And there was found there's a lot less conflict as a result. And everybody really liked it.

86
00:11:09,63 --> 00:11:14,86
And then i went one step further and i just thought i'd set up an office in town

87
00:11:14,86 --> 00:11:22,09
and just make the information office and the call that the rainbow.

88
00:11:22,09 --> 00:11:35,54
And that i was involved in for a number of years as well. All of this was pretty well unpaid. And then.

89
00:11:35,54 --> 00:11:41,24
The rainbow info. Government founding and.

90
00:11:41,24 --> 00:11:46,41
Some of the government founding attracted was neighborhood center founding

91
00:11:46,41 --> 00:11:52,86
and so we ended up changing the name into the name and information and neighborhood center.

92
00:11:52,86 --> 00:12:00,09
Later on i think the new information you've got dropped off and now it's become the new neighborhoods and.

93
00:12:00,09 --> 00:12:06,09
This is a number of projects that. I guess number of things in that wouldn't have been there with there.

94
00:12:06,09 --> 00:12:13,51
If it hadn't been for me standing those things off. That many years ago.

95
00:12:13,51 --> 00:12:33,46
When i voiced had the desire to be self-sufficient. Whatever that may mean.

96
00:12:33,46 --> 00:12:38,79
I mean as as you get older and wiser you realize that there is only so much that you can do.

97
00:12:38,79 --> 00:12:43,69
And it's very you had i mean it's impossible even to be self-sufficient.

98
00:12:43,69 --> 00:12:50,06
And have any kind of modern technology around you. You know. I guess even.

99
00:12:50,06 --> 00:13:01,42
In all sorts of other respects we do need social interaction with people so i guess. The concept of self-sufficient it.

100
00:13:01,42 --> 00:13:06,61
Depending on what extent you want to take it to if you want to take it to the extreme i guess it's just a pie in the

101
00:13:06,61 --> 00:13:09,73
sky i don't think anybody can really achieve that.

102
00:13:09,73 --> 00:13:15,35
But on the other hand we can be self-sufficient to some extent you know we can only veggies

103
00:13:15,35 --> 00:13:19,92
and you know we can do is what i'm doing at home and what we're doing here is become pretty.

104
00:13:19,92 --> 00:13:23,85
Self-sufficient with their requirements. You can catch your own rainwater of course.

105
00:13:25,42 --> 00:13:53,56
So there's all sorts of things that you can do for yourself that don't require a lot of effort or. Sacrifice.

106
00:13:53,56 --> 00:14:04,67
Twelve years living twelve years ago. I had the idea of of setting up a company. Just an idea.

107
00:14:04,67 --> 00:14:16,53
There's a friend of mine doing. Maggot research in nimbin. He was founded to do that and the.

108
00:14:16,53 --> 00:14:28,09
Invited me to join his group to work on. Concepts of setting up. Different things to make people less dependent on.

109
00:14:28,09 --> 00:14:38,42
Security and hopefully. Employed in some degree or other. And. I then stad working on this idea i had.

110
00:14:38,42 --> 00:14:50,1
And i put that into into this guy submission and. At that time i came up with. The name of the rainbow company.

111
00:14:50,1 --> 00:14:58,6
A lot of the concept behind it. And even the logo for the i does even design the logo for that stage.

112
00:14:59,3 --> 00:15:04,13
Now i think you'll find that there's some record somewhere of those submissions.

113
00:15:04,13 --> 00:15:13,05
But since then i spend a lot of time just talking to people about this and going around.

114
00:15:13,05 --> 00:15:21,00
Actually doing some work in that area i mean i've always been interested in renewable energy.

115
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:29,49
Is one of these areas that shows a lot of interest in the face of what i found was that

116
00:15:29,49 --> 00:15:35,8
when people spoke about renewable energy systems very often. Conveniently or otherwise.

117
00:15:35,8 --> 00:15:42,65
The idea of human pair was left out of the picture. And i thought this. Should really sort of.

118
00:15:42,65 --> 00:15:46,58
Make a point with that and try to demonstrate that human.

119
00:15:46,58 --> 00:15:52,81
They are is actually something the door to be considered is very worthwhile. Considering.

120
00:15:52,81 --> 00:16:02,85
Particularly when you look at the amount of time. And many an effort that people put into. Into fitness. You know.

121
00:16:02,85 --> 00:16:08,23
People buy expensive fitness equipment. To put into their own.

122
00:16:09,07 --> 00:16:18,04
They complain about the cost of their electricity bills and whatever they are they're spending a fortune on all this.

123
00:16:18,04 --> 00:16:23,2
Labor saving equipment they've got around the house. And then they have in order to try and create.

124
00:16:23,2 --> 00:16:28,48
Time in order to spend time with these fitness programs right.

125
00:16:28,59 --> 00:16:33,88
And i thought this whole concept is really crazy it's all introverted the something.

126
00:16:34,06 --> 00:16:41,4
But we need to do what you know make it make a lot more sense is to have the equipment that.

127
00:16:41,4 --> 00:16:44,65
Does your work and keeps your feet at the same time.

128
00:16:45,2 --> 00:16:51,32
So instead of buying things three times out of you just just just spend all your time in the one hit.

129
00:16:51,32 --> 00:16:54,7
Both being fit and doing your chores.

130
00:16:54,7 --> 00:17:08,93
And not having to complain about all these electricity bills because you're creating your own energy to do so.

131
00:17:08,93 --> 00:17:17,89
Well i guess if. If you're going to going to spend a lot of time on fitness projects.

132
00:17:17,89 --> 00:17:27,81
You might as well just do a worthwhile tour in the process. It's just seem to be. Perfectly sensible you know.

133
00:17:27,81 --> 00:17:35,84
If other people see the kind of logic that i've got just same so logical if you're going to spend time doing it. Doing.

134
00:17:35,84 --> 00:17:43,74
You know. Some fitness project in this world. Use the energy that you. That you're generating in this.

135
00:17:43,74 --> 00:17:56,74
In this fit in this thing that you're doing. To do it you're at the same time. Well.

136
00:17:56,74 --> 00:18:06,08
My concept of the range at our company was. To have a company first of all that employed people obviously.

137
00:18:06,08 --> 00:18:14,51
That's a company where. The employer. The employees. Were the decision makers.

138
00:18:14,51 --> 00:18:25,28
I like the idea of having a company that was. I guess a bit of a cooperative in some sense. So that.

139
00:18:25,28 --> 00:18:33,19
I didn't like the idea of having a pyramid structure where you've got one central manager managing director all with

140
00:18:33,19 --> 00:18:40,08
ever passing. Decisions all the way down the line and all the workers are all sort of.

141
00:18:40,08 --> 00:18:42,58
Slaving away and complaining about the whole structure

142
00:18:42,58 --> 00:18:48,54
and not being able to do anything about it i wanted to create a structure that was quite different.

143
00:18:48,54 --> 00:19:00,89
Where all the decisions were coming from from the grassroots up rather than from the from structure from the top down

144
00:19:00,89 --> 00:19:04,95
or so when the company.

145
00:19:04,95 --> 00:19:21,16
You know the fans of the company to come from those workers as well as the company got set up now. As it developed.

146
00:19:21,16 --> 00:19:31,74
We had a meeting. I was you know. As i was saying i'll go back through the stupid. Little bit more now.

147
00:19:31,74 --> 00:19:37,53
First of all i had this concept in later on there was a couple of people living nearby who said

148
00:19:37,53 --> 00:19:42,94
but won't you just go and do something of the other night so we put in thirty dollars a piece

149
00:19:42,94 --> 00:19:48,22
and bought some gear instead of selling at local markets under the banner of the rain that our company.

150
00:19:48,22 --> 00:19:55,23
Company was and wasn't an official company as yet. That sort of spread the word.

151
00:19:55,23 --> 00:20:03,49
A lot better than just talking about this. And then a few years later actually it was february of. Eighty seven.

152
00:20:03,49 --> 00:20:08,23
That somebody else. Heard a bell and said look let's let's actually get.

153
00:20:08,75 --> 00:20:17,12
Rolling properly now and call it a public meeting. So meeting was called in favor of eighty seven.

154
00:20:17,12 --> 00:20:24,14
Demand a source factory in the nimba neighborhood center as it was then.

155
00:20:24,14 --> 00:20:33,42
To see if we could get all the expertise all together in new in the one place to formalize the company properly.

156
00:20:33,89 --> 00:20:39,28
So we had the meeting and we found the.

157
00:20:39,28 --> 00:20:43,58
Required skills were all there at the meeting and everybody's really came to go on with it.

158
00:20:43,58 --> 00:20:53,09
So we actually decided to set up a company. And in july eighty seven.

159
00:20:53,09 --> 00:20:58,74
We had a company registered in the northeast of eighty seven we set up shop in newman.

160
00:20:58,74 --> 00:21:17,25
And since then we've never looked back. Just just going from. Good to better to. You know.

161
00:21:17,25 --> 00:21:22,46
Well to start with we were selling. Mostly just reselling.

162
00:21:22,46 --> 00:21:30,53
You know just we still resell all of that we've been through through this time i guess the products have been.

163
00:21:30,53 --> 00:21:42,45
Become a lot better researched. To start with. We had some of their own products not many.

164
00:21:42,45 --> 00:21:47,48
But just things like control boards. We did make their own regulators familiar face.

165
00:21:47,74 --> 00:21:51,41
We made their own rechargeable torches right from the beginning.

166
00:21:52,87 --> 00:22:02,38
And then we were right at that meeting of february seventh i told you bet we decided then that one of the products that

167
00:22:02,38 --> 00:22:12,45
we really get to get up and running. Was the hydro the. My god you know they exist and.

168
00:22:12,45 --> 00:22:20,16
So we put a lot of effort into that. To actually be able to come up with a good product and to start selling it.

169
00:22:20,16 --> 00:22:43,77
But it still took us almost a year before we actually got there first. First ones. On to this floor and really.

170
00:22:43,77 --> 00:22:57,68
Well i guess. I've always been into making things public. You know. As with a company we don't like and.

171
00:22:57,68 --> 00:23:03,05
We don't really endorse the idea of copyright and of painting and that's the stuff.

172
00:23:03,05 --> 00:23:04,79
We tend not to paid and anything here.

173
00:23:05,51 --> 00:23:15,5
We just like things to be public knowledge and to be aired in the public arena so to speak and.

174
00:23:17,28 --> 00:23:26,38
So i said i've often been writing material. With a view of publishing a just a make or this information.

175
00:23:26,38 --> 00:23:29,67
Public knowledge and.

176
00:23:29,67 --> 00:23:37,33
We wanted to be able to produce a catalog for the for the rain but our company just to show people what the product.

177
00:23:37,33 --> 00:23:40,26
We didn't. Wanted to just be a catalog.

178
00:23:40,26 --> 00:23:49,99
We wanted it to be a lot more than we wanted it to be a handbook you know so that people could read it

179
00:23:49,99 --> 00:23:58,79
and could learn from it themselves of how to do all this stuff for themselves without having to employ some experience

180
00:23:58,79 --> 00:24:11,9
you know to to do all this stuff for you know the thing with low voltage systems is that you. Don't need to have.

181
00:24:11,9 --> 00:24:18,29
Have a qualified person to install it for you. Theoretically anybody can install their own.

182
00:24:18,29 --> 00:24:22,24
Low vol that system because there's really no danger or great danger involved.

183
00:24:22,24 --> 00:24:28,26
The biggest danger that you possibly may have is the possibility of setting your house and fire but.

184
00:24:28,26 --> 00:24:32,67
If you do it properly. And you put fuses in your system and stuff then it's not going to happen anyway.

185
00:24:32,97 --> 00:24:42,54
So we thought this is a great opportunity to keep the power with the people.

186
00:24:45,31 --> 00:24:48,63
Just reminded me of john lennon song a bit.

187
00:24:48,63 --> 00:24:58,61
But you know the idea of have you know of making the skills available to everybody. So i stand. To write the book.

188
00:24:58,61 --> 00:25:00,74
With a view of a standing offer.

189
00:25:00,74 --> 00:25:06,23
With a view of it being the rain that their company catalog that i thought would be a lot more than that.

190
00:25:06,23 --> 00:25:13,06
So i wrote it in a way that you don't need any. Fantastic skills to understand it. You know.

191
00:25:13,06 --> 00:25:22,89
Written in layman's language. So that anybody with with just the basics of primary school education.

192
00:25:22,89 --> 00:25:23,88
Could understand a book

193
00:25:23,88 --> 00:25:31,8
and with any kind of skills of doing anything for themselves at all they should be able to also put up their own power

194
00:25:31,8 --> 00:25:43,24
system. So that book. Was finally ready. I guess and. Bet.

195
00:25:43,24 --> 00:25:50,9
Much the same terms are just system as was the shop floor and immediately was a great success.

196
00:25:51,56 --> 00:26:00,56
That was our first edition many sixth edition. With in the meantime we've sold them.

197
00:26:00,56 --> 00:26:21,89
And it was selling faster and faster stone goes on so it's turned out to be. A very popular book. Company. It was.

198
00:26:21,89 --> 00:26:23,07
You'd expect of course.

199
00:26:23,07 --> 00:26:32,00
When we first opened up shop in in august of eighty seven we we had to make enough money just to support one person.

200
00:26:32,66 --> 00:26:48,03
But the word soon spread. That we were there and. Just joins in with the figures but.

201
00:26:48,03 --> 00:26:53,85
In the first year i think we made of. Hundred thousand or something. I think.

202
00:26:55,57 --> 00:27:00,31
But since then we've been growing at a rate of forty five to fifty percent per annum.

203
00:27:00,31 --> 00:27:03,72
Right up until last year we've slowed down a bit.

204
00:27:03,72 --> 00:27:08,77
In the last year but it looks now actually that was down to take off again.

205
00:27:08,77 --> 00:27:14,3
So it was a growth rate of forty to forty five percent. Brendan for four years.

206
00:27:14,3 --> 00:27:20,52
And then slowed down and that looks like we're probably going to go back up and that's the same. Growth rate.

207
00:27:20,52 --> 00:27:25,71
Which makes it very difficult that kind of growth rate because it's like trying to run.

208
00:27:25,71 --> 00:27:31,56
When you've had to learn to crawl. You know. And that's the way the company's been going all along.

209
00:27:31,56 --> 00:27:34,19
You know now we're employing twenty people.

210
00:27:35,4 --> 00:27:44,91
We've got a turnover of excess of a million dollars i think that we'll probably hit at least one half million this year.

211
00:27:44,91 --> 00:27:53,16
And we still growing. We've set up another company called re shape. Which is so.

212
00:27:53,16 --> 00:27:57,53
Reshape is their overseas magazine company.

213
00:27:57,53 --> 00:28:06,42
And we say that we predict that is going to really take off in the next couple of years. And it reshape is going to.

214
00:28:06,42 --> 00:28:13,26
Far exceed. Say. I was within the strain. At present where we're selling this trail you know wide.

215
00:28:13,26 --> 00:28:22,24
But take off i think that the salesman this trail is only going to be a drop in the bucket is compared to say i was

216
00:28:22,24 --> 00:28:28,7
overseas so i can see it we're going to go through and number of really huge growth spurts yet.

217
00:28:36,4 --> 00:28:40,00
One of the problems with promoting renewable energy. In a stray idea.

218
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:47,72
Is that the people that need to know about most of the people there in remote areas and.

219
00:28:47,72 --> 00:28:52,98
The greatest difficulty getting and advertising to remote areas.

220
00:28:52,98 --> 00:29:00,93
Is very easy to get to a city suburban environment but. As it stands at the moment.

221
00:29:01,56 --> 00:29:13,46
That's not where i say i was like i say i was you know i think. For instance. If you look at homestead.

222
00:29:13,46 --> 00:29:20,95
Cattle stations etc. A lot of them are running on very big generators and.

223
00:29:20,95 --> 00:29:28,96
In this day and age and saying that they should rely for all that they are a few are being exploited

224
00:29:28,96 --> 00:29:39,56
or transported all over the country for them. And the same of course. Same idea holds true for.

225
00:29:39,56 --> 00:29:55,16
Countries overseas you know. When we have any kind of. Overseas aid programs in.

226
00:29:55,16 --> 00:30:01,21
Invariably with what they give to these people overseas is these with generators and to me that's totally insane.

227
00:30:01,21 --> 00:30:08,23
You know. These people can't afford to buy the diesel for him. And usually what happens is makes people feel good that.

228
00:30:08,43 --> 00:30:11,29
Send it to them you know and maybe also wonderful.

229
00:30:11,29 --> 00:30:16,32
Tax dodging all sorts of stuff that is no use to these people at all you know first of all they don't have the

230
00:30:16,32 --> 00:30:26,38
mechanical skill to maintain the equipment. And secondly that. You know in small pacific islands or remote areas.

231
00:30:26,38 --> 00:30:31,09
Southeast asia we're talking about.

232
00:30:31,09 --> 00:30:40,29
It's just too expensive for for them to get the days where they just can't afford it. So we need to.

233
00:30:40,29 --> 00:30:45,58
You know it's a it makes a lot more sense to in these areas to have over the energy systems.

234
00:30:46,29 --> 00:30:52,27
You know once the system is up and running it maintains itself. You know you put a solar panel up in the sand.

235
00:30:52,27 --> 00:30:59,52
And you know it. It will have the capability of charging a better way for the next thirty years and.

236
00:30:59,52 --> 00:31:02,68
You know without doing anything to it you don't know moving parts

237
00:31:02,68 --> 00:31:05,84
and you don't have to maintain your thing there's nothing to fix in it.

238
00:31:05,84 --> 00:31:11,38
You just placed in the sand connected better do it in a better or just keep on being challenged by it.

239
00:31:11,7 --> 00:31:17,13
So in remote areas of australia and.

240
00:31:17,13 --> 00:31:25,55
Anywhere else in the world i guess it just makes a much more sense to have energy systems that.
