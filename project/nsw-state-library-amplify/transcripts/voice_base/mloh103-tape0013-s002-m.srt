1
00:00:14,87 --> 00:00:28,09
Yes. With the epping of the children you mean. Some of the kids are quite nice but. A lot of them.

2
00:00:28,09 --> 00:00:32,42
But it's probably not just the paper from here i think it's a general trend everywhere.

3
00:00:32,66 --> 00:00:39,71
Kids have no respect for anyone or anything anymore. That's more oil device ins.

4
00:00:39,71 --> 00:00:50,56
Than i but i think it's probably it just doesn't relate to the people of name and i think it relates to the maybe way.

5
00:00:51,38 --> 00:01:03,01
You know. Some of our grandchildren are growing up here in name. And at the moment and.

6
00:01:03,01 --> 00:01:13,61
I have a sixteen year old and eleven year old. But i don't even want to go up the street. I just.

7
00:01:13,61 --> 00:01:17,46
And my four year old grandson.

8
00:01:17,46 --> 00:01:24,91
If we're walking along the street we have to go past the rainbow cafe he will sort of stand back

9
00:01:24,91 --> 00:01:35,65
and so i do we have to walk this way nana. That's from a four year old so. What do you judge out of that.

10
00:01:38,71 --> 00:01:43,97
By at the other two grand kids don't they get off their school bus or get loose more school

11
00:01:43,97 --> 00:01:46,36
and get off the school bus and go home and that's because of these

12
00:01:46,36 --> 00:02:00,4
and then that hangs straight at all not want to see you. Experience of the drug.

13
00:02:00,65 --> 00:02:07,81
I don't see a lot of it happening around with my job at the moment.

14
00:02:07,81 --> 00:02:15,65
We don't see a lot of it would probably be a lot of evidence that we've done. Just sort of. You know.

15
00:02:15,65 --> 00:02:26,65
So you come in contact with a lot of it my husband does he. Gets a bit disgusted it turns with.

16
00:02:26,65 --> 00:02:30,83
Nader's lawing around him. What everybody has to pick up. That sort of thing.

17
00:02:30,83 --> 00:02:35,83
And i don't know are going to alter that or the been trying to do that for a couple of years now his net.

18
00:02:36,39 --> 00:02:47,86
So you can you joke. You know what you saw day. Yeah i did.

19
00:02:51,99 --> 00:02:59,91
Yes and there is i don't know whether it's because the people who are into consuming alcohol

20
00:02:59,91 --> 00:03:11,11
or nothing else to do with a time. But i certainly white. For dull die and. And they sort of.

21
00:03:11,11 --> 00:03:18,05
They're off they face for the first couple of guys with the influence of alcohol so i mean it certainly has its

22
00:03:18,05 --> 00:03:27,69
problems as well. Where you were you know one of the.

23
00:03:27,69 --> 00:03:36,43
Well i say name in advancing in the next couple of years now as sewage systems going through what they say to be a big

24
00:03:36,43 --> 00:03:46,65
demand for lane then what have you so i think that nimbin will thrive. Particularly now. Hopefully when you.

25
00:03:46,65 --> 00:04:03,24
And i want to be anywhere else but limit. These days. I don't really know i would never leave. But my kids. You know.

26
00:04:03,24 --> 00:04:10,83
Yes it's. It's so much different to anywhere else. You know. But.

27
00:04:10,83 --> 00:04:19,54
Some good things some bad things so i think it's a good place for the kids to. To be brought up and.

28
00:04:19,54 --> 00:04:33,05
What else can i say that was when i was born at more. Lived at a place they call.

29
00:04:33,05 --> 00:04:38,41
Blue note and that's just through on the toy. Border.

30
00:04:38,41 --> 00:04:47,97
I went to school and annoyed when i did to my finish my primaries going. I did three.

31
00:04:47,97 --> 00:04:53,02
Been traveling to nimbin on the bus.

32
00:04:53,02 --> 00:04:58,04
And when i finished there i came to naman and started work

33
00:04:58,04 --> 00:05:14,52
and have been here ever since what was there very very good we we had my day ron ron. And plaintiveness wiggins.

34
00:05:14,52 --> 00:05:20,3
They instead you know out of the way. And in those days. We didn't worry man.

35
00:05:20,3 --> 00:05:23,12
Alcohol or anything with them we really had a good time.

36
00:05:23,12 --> 00:05:30,52
I think probably the kids of today are missing out on the top it's a good time to used to have i'm not as interested in

37
00:05:30,52 --> 00:05:39,71
sport in email. More like we were. You know. I'd like to say that it sort of take a swing back to that.

38
00:05:39,71 --> 00:05:48,43
So that you get the kids do something rather than. Hang around the streets and. You know. Band laws and property and.

39
00:05:48,43 --> 00:06:07,7
All that sort of stuff. So i think they've drawn heaps wise to draw on. And so the town.

40
00:06:07,7 --> 00:06:21,23
But it just doesn't always work. Some kids. I just. Rebels you know i just don't want to sort of think that you say oh.

41
00:06:21,23 --> 00:06:28,11
Don't do that i just don't. And then you know i just get pleasure out of doing it i believe.

42
00:06:28,11 --> 00:06:40,18
But i think that's general to it's not just human and also probably or. You know. Getting a bit discussed and.

43
00:06:40,18 --> 00:06:53,15
I mean we never did those who were things i don't think they should do and what so and good.

44
00:06:56,73 --> 00:07:07,56
I think of the last five years. Newman's. Sort of. The quality of people who come here as. Is trying.

45
00:07:09,43 --> 00:07:22,55
I think i'm not saying. Name been as. High even to. To practice. They have but it's a much i.

46
00:07:22,55 --> 00:07:30,15
My seem to think that they can come here and do it freely and not anything happen to them and. That seems to attract.

47
00:07:30,15 --> 00:07:40,88
All that sort of person. Ministerial some you know it's people coming into that. We certainly have their share of the.

48
00:07:40,88 --> 00:07:57,03
The ones who will. Leave a big debate is oh i'm it's i don't know. Ok you type what is just a symbol of.

49
00:07:57,03 --> 00:08:09,32
Who is the most money going to need and then to resell it to them ira.

50
00:08:09,32 --> 00:08:14,64
If you think he's going to forty two columns straight.

51
00:08:14,73 --> 00:08:30,18
And during the festival i work the dies he do it at the back with you the reason you didn't before. My squad.

52
00:08:30,18 --> 00:08:40,12
Let's go out of the mail for everyone kind of tandem said i moaning zoeth buzz. You know.

53
00:08:40,12 --> 00:08:53,38
Wasn't lost on a lot in nimbin before the festival. Was why i don't know whether david died.

54
00:08:53,38 --> 00:08:58,7
The cattle industry and that sort of thing was all gowing.

55
00:08:58,7 --> 00:09:02,88
Shops with lies ing but i think there would always been a few shops in name.

56
00:09:02,88 --> 00:09:20,87
Then i think we would have died completely it was actually a shock. Well i had mixed feelings.

57
00:09:20,87 --> 00:09:28,64
I did have mixed feelings. I can't be responsible for having it because i wasn't here when i bided it in rats.

58
00:09:28,64 --> 00:09:35,87
I was all a dying alive but i don't regret having it.

59
00:09:35,87 --> 00:09:52,89
And i regret saying you know what a lot can remember them doing here in front of you not doing their own thing.

60
00:09:52,89 --> 00:10:00,77
This moralists. Sort of marching them out surprise got down on the fields and and do it all and i didn't sort of.

61
00:10:00,77 --> 00:10:14,64
I wasn't involved in it probably that when you. When you say it was you know you know i just i'm getting prepared for.

62
00:10:14,74 --> 00:10:20,22
In the fields with the war looked and. This fixing it up in general and sort of.

63
00:10:20,22 --> 00:10:28,44
Spies getting a bad talking to put on getting to know them i think i'm dr madam quite well live as a talk on the by

64
00:10:28,44 --> 00:10:33,58
where he is.

65
00:10:33,58 --> 00:10:40,06
And i think some of them still feel that some of them are gone but some of them still is by bermuda ridge

66
00:10:40,06 --> 00:10:54,86
and i sort of started that. Thing when it was just simon if i had learned to handle.

67
00:10:54,86 --> 00:10:59,14
I think we stood behind a counter from ford i dies

68
00:10:59,14 --> 00:11:03,86
and thought i know it's just so playful there was just nothing else to say it was just side busy.

69
00:11:03,86 --> 00:11:11,09
You know what i think at that time. And i was a bad or you could side that was just simon if i had to look.

70
00:11:11,09 --> 00:11:26,08
It was on radio. That a small tan lightening been good. Just have so many people. I mean. Can you just sort of.

71
00:11:26,08 --> 00:11:38,89
So i'm rambling. And larry's some of some wonderful eyes to the most rides were wonderful.

72
00:11:38,89 --> 00:11:43,75
And to sort of stood there thinking will we ever get out of this applies to lock in habit that we had not a driver

73
00:11:43,75 --> 00:11:45,43
behind that cannot and it does

74
00:11:45,43 --> 00:11:56,62
but we're probably tend to eat a lot it's i was probably live a very patient people as we would do

75
00:11:56,62 --> 00:12:02,01
but i thought why would i want to know many of us things happen so hard that just so a lot of those a lot of drinking

76
00:12:02,01 --> 00:12:07,69
us. As there was. But that's what it was all about wasn't it was a fist of oak was.

77
00:12:07,69 --> 00:12:25,61
I think the biggest luck with i didn't know what do you. You know i don't think we did. Really truly that.

78
00:12:25,61 --> 00:12:30,84
Most of us because we would know if we didn't expect them to stop by and then

79
00:12:30,84 --> 00:12:42,69
when you think back you think what would you expect that we didn't expect them to stop it just didn't.

80
00:12:42,69 --> 00:12:44,49
That are that regret that.

81
00:12:44,49 --> 00:12:51,2
Some of them have started off a set of mud some good friends out of the bible that have kind of after the festival.

82
00:12:51,2 --> 00:12:51,88
You know.

83
00:12:51,88 --> 00:12:59,33
And that's with us a buzz you know if we ran it up to did come from with the fist of a limit and be a lot of them.

84
00:12:59,33 --> 00:13:09,97
He and they and their children some of the children would be a but there is some of them still here and there is

85
00:13:09,97 --> 00:13:14,47
but lot of us just saw many people in that fort knox you couldn't cite.

86
00:13:14,47 --> 00:13:19,3
When yes i got tonight is this a number some of them that we did get to know. It was you know.

87
00:13:19,3 --> 00:13:24,69
Two young girls that we sort of got to talk to him. And that sort of thing.

88
00:13:24,69 --> 00:13:27,66
You're talking about happy memories of festivals now.

89
00:13:27,66 --> 00:13:31,41
Probably one of the things that often records that are really enjoyed. Was.

90
00:13:31,41 --> 00:13:36,63
We shot the shop side for two way out from the. Two o'clock in the morning decline.

91
00:13:36,63 --> 00:13:40,11
And there was a fairly broad and i'm of dennis.

92
00:13:40,11 --> 00:13:46,47
And he used to come along with these guitar and we used to dance in this room in dies you know and to wait. And again.

93
00:13:46,47 --> 00:13:52,87
And that was greit that was fun. Just the stuff from dennis pynoos guitar.

94
00:13:52,87 --> 00:14:00,87
And that sort of and he was part of that system working in that that to my it was something that i will remember.

95
00:14:00,87 --> 00:14:10,69
Personally from that festival in that fort i mean the actual fourteen dies at that festival that would be something

96
00:14:10,69 --> 00:14:20,02
that i would remember with a lot of joy. Well we always said that we would have an island little paddy.

97
00:14:20,02 --> 00:14:28,68
More labor minerals was sort of. Have been the scene there. And it was. And we had. You know it was probably on.

98
00:14:28,68 --> 00:14:33,26
Ten or twelve of us that worked in guises in the long sheath so sid.

99
00:14:33,26 --> 00:14:35,3
You sort of think of it and think you never went to bed

100
00:14:35,3 --> 00:14:41,53
but they had a bath in abuja so i told them to just sort of pulled out of god's light and get up and keep going again.

101
00:14:41,53 --> 00:14:44,4
And you did do that but now i've got fond memories of.

102
00:14:44,4 --> 00:14:52,08
Some of those things that happened during that for i think a lot of said things of coming out.

103
00:14:52,08 --> 00:14:56,24
Not from that actual fist of what you know along that twenty news.

104
00:14:56,24 --> 00:15:02,05
That has a normal brain on the full sense thing that can use.

105
00:15:02,05 --> 00:15:21,25
So well and shops you know that the aa think the town has grown and it's still early when the place.

106
00:15:21,25 --> 00:15:27,26
There was a lot of. What your side.

107
00:15:27,26 --> 00:15:30,57
Disputes in how things it just didn't strides

108
00:15:30,57 --> 00:15:34,87
and if these are spread you could call it just didn't so yard a lot because.

109
00:15:34,87 --> 00:15:39,97
And i think that came from the fact that we thought that his play but we're going to pack it up and god.

110
00:15:39,97 --> 00:15:47,93
In twenty years what we have he nailed. I think we've become very tolerant of one another and now.

111
00:15:47,93 --> 00:15:53,25
I think that things have even themselves they are i'm not signing that.

112
00:15:53,25 --> 00:16:00,85
We don't get cross with one another at times and that. And i suppose we get cross with you jabba. You know happened.

113
00:16:00,85 --> 00:16:06,47
I think we've become. With come along why. In twenty years that we can side that.

114
00:16:06,47 --> 00:16:16,00
We act tolerant of one another nail and we can. You know this issues that we will never bring on. But. Yeah.

115
00:16:16,00 --> 00:16:27,94
Can sort of this and sort of do along the way our way and you know and that sort of thing about him and even his kind.

116
00:16:27,94 --> 00:16:36,62
On the simon has a seven heels to so many beautiful climbs up in the heels is.

117
00:16:36,62 --> 00:16:42,43
You know some papers on his or her legs how bees in heels but you've got to get out there in the eyes heels and say.

118
00:16:42,43 --> 00:16:43,56
And there is lovely.

119
00:16:43,56 --> 00:16:53,31
Was in those heels that those playful have put them up

120
00:16:53,31 --> 00:17:02,02
and sometimes i think the tan maisonneuve was clane as it used to be but then my new gown from probably.

121
00:17:02,02 --> 00:17:06,77
What a couple of players and i thought i'm probably thirty sanson play

122
00:17:06,77 --> 00:17:12,67
but sometimes just those at the moment so you can expect that anyway enough we can create a small town kleinman it's

123
00:17:12,67 --> 00:17:20,36
just sort of got more playful in a day that i read as an obvious job of writing at kleinman. You know.

124
00:17:20,36 --> 00:17:26,91
This daunting thing that's going to you know it's definitely ties.

125
00:17:26,91 --> 00:17:32,86
But i don't think it's for the worse a path and i have said we have a drug problem here

126
00:17:32,86 --> 00:17:38,51
but then i suppose it's everywhere i don't know. I haven't travelled a lot.

127
00:17:38,51 --> 00:17:46,01
This is higher than that from a holiday at the bridge or somewhere like that you just sort of hear.

128
00:17:46,01 --> 00:17:54,54
So that now where they have bigger problems and what we've got anywhere and live you know it's true.

129
00:17:54,54 --> 00:18:03,25
Since early in the price i think.

130
00:18:03,25 --> 00:18:11,08
You now need to run around without their claws on although i think that's gone too i think people have become.

131
00:18:11,08 --> 00:18:14,64
I have been from that so out of this because i'm aware that.

132
00:18:14,74 --> 00:18:20,6
Now we're with you but we're not going to just think this sort of crime here

133
00:18:20,6 --> 00:18:23,95
and so it will not listen to a fact of life and that's what we're going to do.

134
00:18:23,95 --> 00:18:33,76
But then i realize that not everybody was seeing to that so that stopped.

135
00:18:33,76 --> 00:18:45,1
You know that has been caught wales and not not a lot of money lots of things

136
00:18:45,1 --> 00:18:56,18
and i think if you didn't laugh at them you wouldn't leave him going to sense if you me that live in neiman you really

137
00:18:56,18 --> 00:19:08,8
go with that but it will discount. What's it's just anything. You know when it's organized. Loftier naman.

138
00:19:08,8 --> 00:19:19,09
When you come in limply you throw in a fortnight and you'll say what on line. It's. It's different.

139
00:19:19,09 --> 00:19:30,48
Just different living here. You've got a. You've got a lot name. And believe in it. This is for sure. I think it has.

140
00:19:30,48 --> 00:19:42,64
I think it hits us and what we print. All right one another in the beginning of that. So i know.

141
00:19:42,64 --> 00:19:47,8
Ron up until probably doing year ago i think we you know we think. Oh my god.

142
00:19:47,8 --> 00:19:51,2
You know we're going to go up to events or even funny.

143
00:19:51,2 --> 00:19:56,63
And we think most of us got to a study where you sort of said oh we live just arab lives more we didn't.

144
00:19:56,63 --> 00:20:02,44
Dad tailpipe what we believed in him meant. And that now you do you say as we leave the room and you know.

145
00:20:02,44 --> 00:20:08,81
We're proud of that fact that. So yes we've we've all grown up. Oh all of us i think.

146
00:20:08,81 --> 00:20:19,71
And then has grown on with ground up together. And that's something that we should be proud. Supplants.

147
00:20:19,71 --> 00:20:27,86
Well i had john wayne in the oldest and then the festival was the following nine. So. Wendy.

148
00:20:27,86 --> 00:20:30,25
The oldest would be about ita

149
00:20:30,25 --> 00:20:35,54
and i would have went to school together during that this time i'm not going to remove the time that we're devoting

150
00:20:35,54 --> 00:20:40,2
nothing we've had one walk through the fields you know. And that's an attack and only contact.

151
00:20:40,2 --> 00:20:46,7
Oh mummy and ruth they've got my plan as i'm so you know mommy sort of grabbed them and ran off because i didn't know.

152
00:20:46,7 --> 00:20:55,24
Those brave little. You know as i would let them.

153
00:20:55,24 --> 00:20:59,47
Look i enjoyed it i think you know what guys to our ones would remember albert.

154
00:20:59,47 --> 00:21:03,00
When he would remember it more than anything else

155
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:09,23
but i didn't sort of get add a lot because he would move on the straights in that fortnight but after that.

156
00:21:09,23 --> 00:21:17,23
In this sort of from group way that was the one never encouraged him.

157
00:21:17,23 --> 00:21:19,93
You know you run you going to have some dried friends done to bring him.

158
00:21:19,93 --> 00:21:27,04
Because i think nice kids sort of ran through this has as much as anybody's kids you know and.

159
00:21:27,04 --> 00:21:34,08
Carriage that i sort of felt that was important that if that we're all going to school together the thought i had to be

160
00:21:34,08 --> 00:21:39,02
that we're all children. And i belong to somebody. And that was.

161
00:21:39,02 --> 00:21:47,04
I always sort of this sort of that that was the why we were going to god that you know that bible

162
00:21:47,04 --> 00:21:54,93
or children out there together and that's what we we wanted for them. And i think it's a done the most good the.

163
00:21:54,93 --> 00:22:02,21
Rounding up in name and i think at jordan ladder lot. And i didn't.

164
00:22:02,21 --> 00:22:08,99
I think i really think that i i did that night and i learned a lot through being in that twenty is.

165
00:22:08,99 --> 00:22:26,43
During and after that this is a phone. I'm not disappointed i rate them. Well mine only through not so much with.

166
00:22:26,43 --> 00:22:34,74
Parents i think about think.

167
00:22:34,74 --> 00:22:43,55
I was more concerned about the education department thought of getting me into more of these free education instead of

168
00:22:43,55 --> 00:22:47,19
you know going in a classroom doing things that was my.

169
00:22:47,19 --> 00:22:55,49
Amount of speaking from the way i was used to the our why of schooling and that's what i wanted from our children.

170
00:22:55,49 --> 00:23:05,43
To spill. The line i did that and i think. I still think that. And it was you know.

171
00:23:05,43 --> 00:23:15,49
But moves fast now i don't think that the idea about you know the kids or anything. And you know i think i was.

172
00:23:15,49 --> 00:23:22,72
I was in some cases i would sign now you can't guide that person supplies because it was a can mean situation

173
00:23:22,72 --> 00:23:31,37
or something and i didn't know about it so i didn't sort of argue well fraud

174
00:23:31,37 --> 00:23:37,9
or anything like that without the parents you know i think that any of that children that my children got to know the

175
00:23:37,9 --> 00:23:48,01
parents in our sort of had a thing as well. Even that we know one another. It's not. You know. We didn't sort of.

176
00:23:48,01 --> 00:23:52,76
The of rinds roots of one another time logs that.

177
00:23:52,76 --> 00:23:57,04
And because i lived here in town i'll surprise you know after the years it was sort of.

178
00:23:57,04 --> 00:24:02,25
Easy for monday when school starts it was on the kids could come here and get dressed and go off to school

179
00:24:02,25 --> 00:24:04,45
and then the moms would come and pick them up leider

180
00:24:04,45 --> 00:24:12,33
and then that was sort of a my thing like that that probably ma kids.

181
00:24:12,33 --> 00:24:15,44
Didn't get out of the communism that a lot but i sort of. Went after.

182
00:24:15,44 --> 00:24:25,63
As a group of kids in north to try things that was on more than slaving in times and that. To get them but.

183
00:24:25,63 --> 00:24:27,65
I said if i had to live again i would do it.

184
00:24:27,65 --> 00:24:44,66
To sign my own citizens were really not because i didn't know a lot so it was probably a lot lighter in our logs that.

185
00:24:44,66 --> 00:24:52,58
We met a young couple. And i had traded her children and we did. Got a ton of acromion and by noon they heineman.

186
00:24:52,58 --> 00:24:54,15
And things like that and that was.

187
00:24:54,15 --> 00:24:58,56
To us was probably an eye opener because you know you hear those things early

188
00:24:58,56 --> 00:25:03,8
or run around on communes with flies on a night. This and. Oh wait we had a lovely die.

189
00:25:03,8 --> 00:25:09,4
On ton of a family and in the end we didn't say. Very many playful adore you know that.

190
00:25:09,4 --> 00:25:13,63
And night my certainly all implies on i'm on admin with them.

191
00:25:13,63 --> 00:25:19,8
So early in the post when our kids with it we didn't know. We were learning. What we were learning.

192
00:25:19,8 --> 00:25:24,12
And so we didn't i want to but what sort of things went on.

193
00:25:24,12 --> 00:25:30,23
You know because we'd know where you had a veil and we wasn't living in. Group of people.

194
00:25:30,23 --> 00:25:35,51
We didn't know what we were so much sort of crazy to cyanide and a very sort of.

195
00:25:35,51 --> 00:25:51,36
Why are you back in the water by doing. Straights. You know i think we all had that sign madia that.

196
00:25:51,36 --> 00:25:57,36
The room giving me update you now. Am i living in that. I don't think there was any real room is a bath.

197
00:25:57,36 --> 00:26:02,22
Because now i was the one the people that lived did none of us knew what was.

198
00:26:02,22 --> 00:26:10,22
When you that bought some land and we are not i think when you were a month i was leaving when that living in tents

199
00:26:10,22 --> 00:26:14,64
or for an hour what your child was going to actually like sleeping when i got there where the.

200
00:26:14,73 --> 00:26:22,58
It's going to be bedded down on a blanket under the stars of what we didn't know we did we didn't rumah what was

201
00:26:22,58 --> 00:26:28,29
happening because we didn't. We we honestly didn't know i would leaving out there.

202
00:26:28,29 --> 00:26:34,79
And office it was years lyda that we actually were given the opportunity to go on to that property and and.

203
00:26:34,79 --> 00:26:46,33
So that i did at normal as the sun was what went on and. So possibly now. If i had a daughter of science.

204
00:26:46,33 --> 00:26:54,97
I do not be quite happy. If i knew that there at the site is good. You know i'm happy but deep down you're a guy.

205
00:26:54,97 --> 00:26:59,42
Or i wouldn't. I'm not good because i didn't know.

206
00:26:59,42 --> 00:27:06,49
But now that i've been there and often are now that they've gotten lost homes the same as not the whole but the.

207
00:27:06,49 --> 00:27:12,42
Dyad leaving. To walk by can afford them.

208
00:27:12,42 --> 00:27:16,00
Probably because i'm older of them so i want to stop and understand that it's constant.

209
00:27:16,00 --> 00:27:21,62
You know it's fifteen years for them to get that size ready because we're still getting this ready you have to twenty

210
00:27:21,62 --> 00:27:24,46
six years you know there's lots of things to do.

211
00:27:24,46 --> 00:27:26,96
But when i was younger i was probably not as tall

212
00:27:26,96 --> 00:27:40,32
or single you know that probably living up to about a box of things but no plane they its own nail and. Yes.

213
00:27:40,32 --> 00:27:47,99
Oh yes we've all wizened this but then you look at it now. But when we bought it. It was four rooms.

214
00:27:47,99 --> 00:27:50,27
And the brand was falling off it so i was.

215
00:27:50,27 --> 00:27:58,47
It wasn't very out past the weird sort of arrival of a sad twenty six sort of. Paddling along the do up. You know.

216
00:27:58,47 --> 00:27:58,71
That's

217
00:27:58,71 --> 00:28:04,99
and that's why our son now can read light to the eyes put the thought of up there with two rooms it's where the ball

218
00:28:04,99 --> 00:28:12,08
yes we've expanded the brain the role. We thought we got a bathroom or know something lot that. There's you.

219
00:28:12,08 --> 00:28:14,64
You've done a disservice but not us when you younger us by.

220
00:28:15,16 --> 00:28:23,85
Young children need that think more than enough to broaden the law and think oh i wouldn't my kids go up there

221
00:28:23,85 --> 00:28:29,65
but i think we were all the same we were not to say we didn't expect them to start so we didn't expect them

222
00:28:29,65 --> 00:28:47,97
and we didn't know what they were doing when i did bought that land up there or how they were leaving.

223
00:28:47,97 --> 00:28:49,43
We had all sorts of fun.

224
00:28:49,43 --> 00:29:03,00
This morning on the hour that now what we would have done you know and we probably just done what had to be done.

225
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:12,77
Said sandro at the side that you know like us but we're still doing it. You know in a funny sort of why if you say.

226
00:29:12,77 --> 00:29:19,32
Some. Someone needs help or someone's got a little you know. And i think you just do it.

227
00:29:19,32 --> 00:29:27,5
That's a mother's instinct to do that and think that you know how and because we would be in that shop.

228
00:29:27,5 --> 00:29:46,57
With something you just want to look up the kids. You know you talk to young people that were really dan.

229
00:29:46,57 --> 00:29:52,02
When my dad was in a will and a lot of times young kids guy me and i didn't know what they were doing

230
00:29:52,02 --> 00:29:56,76
when i got here right that moment if you could lend a helping hand.

231
00:29:56,76 --> 00:30:03,7
We are no cattle they are not on the last bus we had a few arguments to walk and remember once when i went

232
00:30:03,7 --> 00:30:09,49
and got a kid out of a katherine all the things you do you know.

233
00:30:09,49 --> 00:30:14,64
And it was dormant on the job with crohn's and i went and.

234
00:30:14,98 --> 00:30:23,78
The mother put it back to a matter of this sort of way no one did just anything in dinner last night

235
00:30:23,78 --> 00:30:30,9
and there was some lovely young girls can be that. That got depressed months i got here.

236
00:30:30,9 --> 00:30:38,55
I didn't have a lot i had to come here but i think with this big data getting on let's go. And.

237
00:30:38,55 --> 00:30:58,48
So you know i don't as you're talking to them that they are more tolerant

238
00:30:58,48 --> 00:31:05,63
and i would have been if that have just grown up this three kids in this.

239
00:31:05,63 --> 00:31:11,68
I don't know whether we're to still had a school. You know i'm going back when he would have started school.

240
00:31:11,68 --> 00:31:18,32
Here but i'm sure that it would've. You know we didn't have a lot of. Jordan and we got a big school now.

241
00:31:18,32 --> 00:31:22,83
So i might he wouldn't let us go a lot and i but i think that they they are more tolerant.

242
00:31:22,83 --> 00:31:33,36
Jordan than i would have been had this not happened like that and i had to explain.
