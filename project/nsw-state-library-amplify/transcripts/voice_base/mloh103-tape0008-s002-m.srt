Breaking hearts and cars. Favoring cabin families trip to strawberry fields for ever.

101
00:16:33,31 --> 00:16:44,28
Way down the wet gully path and gums and river below. An ocean of meese. Hurrying through sleep.

102
00:16:44,28 --> 00:16:53,44
Into heat the lazy days backwards into town. Blowing dirt. Creek diving. Valley into facing visitors again.

103
00:16:53,44 --> 00:17:01,71
And the garden. Somewhere between in the mirror. Of deep green mountains. And the children.
