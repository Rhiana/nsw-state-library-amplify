1
00:00:14,54 --> 00:00:20,78
Can you tell us a bit about what happens during those three toes in the cove who were obeying what are people actually

2
00:00:20,78 --> 00:00:29,38
come around about. Well. First of all i'd have to say that the council of all beings can consist of almost anything.

3
00:00:29,38 --> 00:00:36,52
That is congress and with the ideas that i've expressed. Being in harmony with the earth. That.

4
00:00:36,52 --> 00:00:39,47
What we found is that it's the intention that.

5
00:00:39,47 --> 00:00:47,77
Any time a group of people gathered together for a few hours or a few days. To share with each other that ending.

6
00:00:47,77 --> 00:00:52,05
Of the illusion of separation from the earth to share with each other our love for the earth

7
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:58,94
and our desire to be more powerful and. More empowered in the defense of the earth.

8
00:00:59,53 --> 00:01:04,11
This miracle takes place that we experience this that we experience. An awakening.

9
00:01:04,11 --> 00:01:07,91
That we experience an embodiment of this.

10
00:01:07,91 --> 00:01:12,46
But having said that the particular cancelable beings that are laid you know so different.

11
00:01:12,46 --> 00:01:16,76
There are hundreds of people now that facilitate these workshops around the world i just did.

12
00:01:16,76 --> 00:01:23,56
In the last eight months i've done like twenty in the united states and half a dozen in russia and others in holland

13
00:01:23,56 --> 00:01:30,84
and. Findhorn in scotland and other places and. Everywhere people are studying with me and.

14
00:01:30,84 --> 00:01:36,29
Studying with each other how to do this. And everyone can do it differently. You know. But the way that our do it.

15
00:01:36,29 --> 00:01:40,36
We usually start with the intention we make our intention very clear.

16
00:01:40,36 --> 00:01:47,63
Because that's what the whole experience is based on. Then we may go into.

17
00:01:47,63 --> 00:01:50,72
Various processes that help us to feel bonded with each other

18
00:01:50,72 --> 00:01:54,51
and to feel safe with each other then we go into mourning

19
00:01:54,51 --> 00:02:01,52
or grieving process because what we've found is that unless we are prepared to feel the pain of the earth.

20
00:02:01,84 --> 00:02:09,88
We can't really be empowered in the healing of the earth as long as we deny the feeling quality of what's going on as

21
00:02:09,88 --> 00:02:17,51
long as we deny the pain and horror and the. Despair and the right age. That what's going on which.

22
00:02:17,51 --> 00:02:21,03
All of us feel deep down but most of us repress. Then.

23
00:02:21,03 --> 00:02:29,13
We're kind of numb to what's going on so we invite us to feel those things and. From there we go.

24
00:02:29,13 --> 00:02:36,49
Perhaps to an evolutionary remembering where we reenact the evolutionary drama. From the big bang.

25
00:02:36,49 --> 00:02:44,14
Matter and space and time being created in the creation of galaxies and then our own galaxy the milky way.

26
00:02:44,14 --> 00:02:51,64
Within that the sun and its planets. And then on the earth the earth cooling. And the crust forming and.

27
00:02:51,64 --> 00:02:56,87
The development the first cell. The evolution of that cell.

28
00:02:56,87 --> 00:03:01,39
Through the oceans you know like ninety percent of organic life was in the oceans

29
00:03:01,39 --> 00:03:08,34
and in the last ten percent of the time. We. And phoebe ins came to the earth became reptiles and then.

30
00:03:08,34 --> 00:03:11,87
Some of those reptiles. There skiles.

31
00:03:11,87 --> 00:03:15,74
Turned to feathers and they became the birds and other reptiles their skulls to and.

32
00:03:16,55 --> 00:03:21,38
And they became to mammals and that was our lawn. And we just try speck. Our story.

33
00:03:21,6 --> 00:03:26,63
But now it's not just written history that we're identifying with but our whole story the story that's.

34
00:03:26,63 --> 00:03:33,59
You know denied it's in every cell it's in our blood. And we try and. Embody that as much as we can and.

35
00:03:33,59 --> 00:03:37,54
To experience that not just as being another story that we learned at school.

36
00:03:37,54 --> 00:03:45,72
But that's my story that's my creation myth. I wasn't created by an all man with a white beard four thousand years ago.

37
00:03:45,72 --> 00:03:52,38
You know. I've been here for four thousand million years evolving on this earth. You know and just to leave that out.

38
00:03:52,38 --> 00:03:56,65
And then finally we find an ally in nature

39
00:03:56,65 --> 00:04:03,73
and non human being that wishes to speak through us in the council of all beings that maybe an animal or a plant

40
00:04:03,73 --> 00:04:09,13
or a sound. You know maybe the rain or the scar is some natural.

41
00:04:09,13 --> 00:04:14,08
Anything but human being anything on the earth but human we know all about what humans have got to say. But.

42
00:04:14,21 --> 00:04:18,17
All of these others are the voiceless ones they're the ones that.

43
00:04:18,17 --> 00:04:23,84
Our culture doesn't hear anymore in fact we don't even believe that they have any voice we think that they just like

44
00:04:23,84 --> 00:04:26,46
machines and so you know we treat animals like machines

45
00:04:26,46 --> 00:04:31,28
and plants like machines that have no sol they have no feelings and.

46
00:04:31,28 --> 00:04:35,68
The fact that they have been evolving alongside of us for four thousand million years is ignored.

47
00:04:35,68 --> 00:04:39,88
So we find an ally and then we make a mask. To represent that ally.

48
00:04:39,88 --> 00:04:44,33
And then finally we gather in the council of all beings without masks on and.

49
00:04:44,33 --> 00:04:50,39
We just in fart out personality to get out of the way for a little while. And we spontaneously. In far.

50
00:04:50,39 --> 00:04:56,36
This being to speak through us. And the matter has seen equal or skeptical we might be to start with and of course.

51
00:04:56,36 --> 00:05:00,42
Most people from the modern world. You know.

52
00:05:00,42 --> 00:05:06,53
Be very very surprised if anyone came to the cancellable breaks for the first time without being highly skeptical about

53
00:05:06,53 --> 00:05:12,9
what was going to happen maybe this is just. Psycho drama maybe this is just a projection of our own personalities.

54
00:05:12,9 --> 00:05:19,42
But always. Everyone is incredibly moved by what takes place and it's different every time.

55
00:05:19,42 --> 00:05:25,83
But always we hear voices from as self saw from each other that we've never heard before with incredible wisdom

56
00:05:25,83 --> 00:05:27,12
and points of view.

57
00:05:27,12 --> 00:05:33,63
That a totally alien to what we've never heard before and it makes us realize that we can then speak for the.

58
00:05:33,63 --> 00:05:35,59
Because we've heard the. We.

59
00:05:35,59 --> 00:05:40,68
If we've had an authentic experience that we really believe that we've heard the earth speaking through these other

60
00:05:40,68 --> 00:05:47,02
beings. Even through our own voice. Then. It's really easy to go up to parliament house.

61
00:05:47,02 --> 00:05:51,66
And you know have someone say well you know my constituency represents.

62
00:05:51,66 --> 00:05:58,72
Thousands and thousands of people who you to tell me what to do. And we can say. Listen mark constituency. Represent.

63
00:05:58,72 --> 00:06:03,48
Hundreds of thousands and millions of species and they're not even represented in your palm and. You know.

64
00:06:03,48 --> 00:06:09,41
They're not even represented. And i speak for them. You know. And to speak with a strong voice because you know.

65
00:06:09,41 --> 00:06:16,54
We know that we're speaking for these. Voiceless ones these. You know. Best of creation which is being ignored.

66
00:06:16,54 --> 00:06:19,52
Which is being shoved out of the way. And.

67
00:06:19,52 --> 00:06:25,57
The thing is that once we recognize that in spite of the two thousand years of.

68
00:06:25,57 --> 00:06:29,96
Judeo christian belief for four thousand whatever it is years.

69
00:06:29,96 --> 00:06:33,6
Of believing that the world is a pyramid with human beings on the top.

70
00:06:33,6 --> 00:06:39,9
And that the world just consists of human beings and. Resources do you know that it's just there for our satisfaction.

71
00:06:39,9 --> 00:06:46,41
In spite of that. It's not true. The world is more like a web. And we humans are one strand in that way.

72
00:06:46,41 --> 00:06:51,62
And if we destroy those other species then we destroy ourselves. So we all know that to be true.

73
00:06:51,62 --> 00:06:55,28
But we don't know how to live that truth we don't know how to change our lives.

74
00:06:55,28 --> 00:07:02,74
And the cancellable brings is a way of bringing that truth. To loft bringing it. And. Changing as selves.

75
00:07:02,74 --> 00:07:09,18
Not on the level of ideas but on the level of values and on the level of life style and behavior.

76
00:07:09,87 --> 00:07:17,34
What about the terms who are your thing and. Region during the employer but something else that you bring to well.

77
00:07:17,34 --> 00:07:27,9
These are similar. Yeah real thing. And really gendering. To other. Workshop forms that. After vell up with.

78
00:07:27,9 --> 00:07:36,79
Many friends that i work with on these things and. Use different techniques. To bring about the same effect.

79
00:07:36,79 --> 00:07:45,59
Of a deep experience. Of cooperation and communion with the planet. In these workshops we use the breath.

80
00:07:45,59 --> 00:07:50,37
To bring us deep into parts of ourselves

81
00:07:50,37 --> 00:07:57,55
and levels of ourselves that we usually unconscious all of these techniques are based on a.

82
00:07:57,55 --> 00:08:03,22
Therapy that's called rebirthing. Where the breath is used to bring.

83
00:08:03,22 --> 00:08:09,95
Unconscious material from the personal part of our conscious things connected with traumas that we had early on in our

84
00:08:09,95 --> 00:08:15,16
lives that we forgotten about repressed. And when we remember them the healing takes. Place.

85
00:08:15,16 --> 00:08:22,14
So by adding a planetary intention and a deep ecology perspective and some other things. These other forms.

86
00:08:22,85 --> 00:08:29,59
Allow us to bring this. Other area that we're totally unconscious of which is our organic nature.

87
00:08:29,59 --> 00:08:35,66
I mean freud found a hundred years ago that we are unconscious of our sexuality. But that's the tiniest part of it.

88
00:08:35,66 --> 00:08:41,96
We are conscious of their organic being aware and conscious of the fact that we've been evolving here for thousands

89
00:08:41,96 --> 00:08:49,84
and millions of years we are conscious of the fact that the food that we ate. Means that the earth. Is our body.

90
00:08:49,84 --> 00:08:56,46
That every time we place. You know. It's like there's this incredible sokal. Where the earth.

91
00:08:56,46 --> 00:09:03,37
Samhain the recklessly grows. These things. And we take these things from the earth and we place them inside our body.

92
00:09:03,37 --> 00:09:07,86
And they become our body. And then. We take a shit and.

93
00:09:07,86 --> 00:09:13,62
The earth in our body goes back into the earth again and there is this incredible cycle of. Earth.

94
00:09:13,62 --> 00:09:18,96
Which is flowing through us streaming through us. And we just started out as this tiny cell.

95
00:09:18,96 --> 00:09:24,51
You know mother's body and we grew there from this earth. And we came out of our mother's body.

96
00:09:24,51 --> 00:09:31,08
And we grew and grew and we are my verse. Yeah. This isn't controversial i don't see it but we don't.

97
00:09:31,08 --> 00:09:38,06
Experience ourselves in this why this isn't part of our identity. Same with the water. There's this incredible sokal.

98
00:09:38,06 --> 00:09:45,04
Where water is lifted up by the sun. And it falls and on its way down it lubricates and creates all of life.

99
00:09:45,04 --> 00:09:50,77
Including us a tiny part of that water. Passes through our body becomes our blood and all of our fluids.

100
00:09:50,77 --> 00:09:54,75
And then we piece it out. Back into the cycle again and.

101
00:09:54,75 --> 00:09:59,27
The air cycle is the same so we are the intersection of the sokal and.

102
00:09:59,27 --> 00:10:07,44
If you have a profound experience of that as being. Actually that is who i am. You know. I'm not some december.

103
00:10:07,44 --> 00:10:14,08
Spirit that somehow trapped in this body. I was brought here from outer space. I am an earthling. Part of this.

104
00:10:14,31 --> 00:10:16,14
If we feel that deeply.

105
00:10:16,14 --> 00:10:20,69
Then it changes the way we behave it changes the way we think so re earthing

106
00:10:20,69 --> 00:10:26,84
and regenerating of ways of bringing about those changes. So that we spontaneously through the breath.

107
00:10:26,84 --> 00:10:35,4
Haven't experienced the changes their identity. Do you feel like. Developed to help develop a new religion or.

108
00:10:35,4 --> 00:10:40,06
Just hope people will discover old ones. Well it's certainly.

109
00:10:40,06 --> 00:10:47,75
It's certainly an old one but in this case i think that it's not just right and i don't get it started yet.

110
00:10:47,75 --> 00:10:55,45
I think that there is a new religion that's being born here. But it's not just religion.

111
00:10:55,62 --> 00:11:02,96
It's it's it's very much in harmony with all of the findings of science. At this time do you know and.

112
00:11:04,4 --> 00:11:12,03
It's also not very new because. This is rediscovering things that area ancestors knew about and.

113
00:11:12,03 --> 00:11:21,58
In particular it's rediscovering a lot of the things that were. That were deliberately. And violently.

114
00:11:21,58 --> 00:11:28,3
Repressed in our society by. Thousands of years of. Judeo christian conditioning.

115
00:11:28,3 --> 00:11:34,09
And most recently perhaps by the inquisition. When no and median.

116
00:11:34,09 --> 00:11:38,86
European women were burned at the stake for their love of nature and for their belief that the earth was a large

117
00:11:38,86 --> 00:11:45,34
and that the world didn't belong to man. And to the spirit. But that the earth belonged to. You know.

118
00:11:45,34 --> 00:11:48,16
All people into the body and. To itself.

119
00:11:48,16 --> 00:11:53,73
You know and so the ritual and ceremony a life that allows us to experience ourselves.

120
00:11:53,73 --> 00:12:02,27
As part of the earth was repressed at that time. What are people who. You know who would say that.

121
00:12:02,27 --> 00:12:06,82
What we've just been listening to. Was a lot of old hippie drivel.

122
00:12:07,58 --> 00:12:14,08
Well you know i feel a little bit sorry for them because i feel my so i don't. Yeah.

123
00:12:15,04 --> 00:12:21,73
Well for those people who feel that. You know that all of this is just a load of old drivel.

124
00:12:21,85 --> 00:12:26,7
I feel a bit sorry for them because i feel that there's a remarkable challenge

125
00:12:26,7 --> 00:12:33,59
and a remarkable opportunity at this time. For human beings. To get real. You know. To get in harmony with the earth.

126
00:12:33,59 --> 00:12:37,54
If we don't do it. We're going to be destroyed and.

127
00:12:37,54 --> 00:12:43,98
It's an amazing thing to be living here on this earth for four thousand million years to have survived the most

128
00:12:43,98 --> 00:12:50,3
incredible challenges can you imagine their ancestors the fish. Learning to walk on the land. You know.

129
00:12:50,3 --> 00:12:58,77
The incredible challenges that we faced. Of ancestors surviving ice after age and.

130
00:12:58,77 --> 00:13:05,77
All of them survivors all of them finding a way through. Passing this precious precious flame of life.

131
00:13:05,77 --> 00:13:13,55
From feelin to claw. To paul. And into our own hands. And then now. We're going to fumble. And let it drop.

132
00:13:13,55 --> 00:13:15,78
You know what i mean. It's an incredible thing.

133
00:13:15,92 --> 00:13:23,76
And so i feel that show people to be so busy playing it business as usual and holding on to those stupid ideas that.

134
00:13:23,76 --> 00:13:29,48
We've developed in the last few thousand years. And letting that beautiful flame drop. For water.

135
00:13:29,48 --> 00:13:35,66
You know for a marker a way of auburn and a second. Electric toothbrushes you know. Such a shine.

136
00:13:35,66 --> 00:13:42,58
So i just feel sorry for them and. I myself don't believe that the earth is going to die i know that you know i mean.

137
00:13:42,58 --> 00:13:47,72
The miracle was here before human beings came along. And it'll be here after they've gone.

138
00:13:47,89 --> 00:13:50,81
The miracle was here before organic life started.

139
00:13:50,81 --> 00:13:56,48
There was a time when there was no organic life on the earth there was just start asked you might side you know.

140
00:13:56,48 --> 00:14:04,58
And eat. Was of itself. Into organic life and into us. And so that miracle. We can't touch that so i'm not really.

141
00:14:04,58 --> 00:14:10,47
Ultimately i'm not despairing because i know that. That is totally secure and totally safe.

142
00:14:10,47 --> 00:14:17,98
But i must say i love this organic law if i love. This. Flesh and bones and blood and breath and. Air.

143
00:14:17,98 --> 00:14:25,16
And all of this consciousness. And i would be very very. All struggle with all my margin. To protect it.

144
00:14:25,16 --> 00:14:33,45
And to keep it going and. You know it's a feel enriched and i have a joy in my life because of these realisations and.

145
00:14:33,45 --> 00:14:40,1
I see the tremendous and happiness in. You know the faces in the lives of most people and.

146
00:14:40,1 --> 00:14:45,54
Tremendous and happiness in their relationships and their. Their inability to love each other or to love themselves.

147
00:14:45,54 --> 00:14:50,3
That i just think people would be doing themselves a favor to. You know look at these thing seriously.

148
00:14:51,05 --> 00:15:00,35
Can i get a definition of the. Aquarius vision. Well the aquarius vision. I just think that it's.

149
00:15:00,35 --> 00:15:09,51
Getting back to our roots. So and so thanks very much. Friday and thank you. Thanks but that was growth.

150
00:15:09,51 --> 00:15:11,01
I carry into this.
