1
00:00:13,97 --> 00:00:32,55
I don't know right now. Well i think i can consider myself an old timer. You want me to summon it. I'm not nicholson.

2
00:00:32,55 --> 00:00:38,61
And i think i can consider myself an old time and now in this area which is the china newman area.

3
00:00:38,61 --> 00:00:42,81
Although i think you have to be here about sixty years before you consider the true blue all time a but.

4
00:00:42,81 --> 00:00:51,14
Having been here for almost twenty years. I consider myself a veteran of a number of bettles. Have been.

5
00:00:51,14 --> 00:00:56,66
Living on the one property for most of those almost twenty years. Trying to make a go out of living on the land.

6
00:00:56,66 --> 00:01:02,22
Running a nursery. Having some kids. Maintaining a relationship. Which is a full time job in itself.

7
00:01:02,22 --> 00:01:07,74
Fighting for the local forests and staying involved in a lot of other issues and.

8
00:01:07,74 --> 00:01:14,71
Doing university study and a lot of other study as well and trying to maintain my intelligence.

9
00:01:14,71 --> 00:01:25,43
Despite a few problems with. Work overload and so on what i think you have to admit for a start it's the aesthetics.

10
00:01:25,43 --> 00:01:32,13
You can't help being affected by the place. When you walk into it. But it's not just that i think it's the sense of.

11
00:01:32,13 --> 00:01:35,49
The fragility in the face of human onslaughts.

12
00:01:35,49 --> 00:01:41,63
That in itself it's not fret job because it's been around for roughly a hundred million years. So we know.

13
00:01:41,63 --> 00:01:47,38
It's extremely durable. That's withstood a number of. Very dramatic climate changes.

14
00:01:47,38 --> 00:01:52,23
But in the face of what we've had up to it it's become extremely fragile.

15
00:01:52,23 --> 00:01:56,89
And so i think was a combination of these two the beauty and the fragility.

16
00:01:56,89 --> 00:02:03,15
And also the fact that there was so the little if we could see. Quite obviously when we came to the north coast that.

17
00:02:03,15 --> 00:02:09,84
The resident vegetation was on the back foot. And retreating very rapidly it's still used by the way to spot.

18
00:02:10,14 --> 00:02:14,41
Political decisions that make people think it's saved in fact it's still very much in danger.

19
00:02:15,37 --> 00:02:19,89
And so when we came to this area to buy land we particularly wanted to get a bit of ng tech forest.

20
00:02:20,12 --> 00:02:26,97
So we ended up buying a piece of land. Immediately adjacent to a state forest which.

21
00:02:26,97 --> 00:02:32,59
On the surface appeared to looking pretty good shape. But as we became more at it to.

22
00:02:34,51 --> 00:02:39,49
Interpret the signs in the rainforest we can see that there had been some previous damage from logging.

23
00:02:39,49 --> 00:02:43,24
Although if it bit of it was in quite good shape. And so we bonded.

24
00:02:43,24 --> 00:02:49,44
Very quickly to that piece of land not on the land that we fund. But the land adjacent. Because it was very beautiful.

25
00:02:49,44 --> 00:02:55,63
It's at the end of a valley with. Cliffs and tall forest and. Beautiful cloud of things.

26
00:02:55,63 --> 00:03:02,00
So it became very attached this is and. Felt we should. Thought. You know its defense.

27
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:05,25
When we discovered that it was in fact.

28
00:03:05,25 --> 00:03:10,83
In danger he made it future and that was after a few months after we arrived at the place in seventy four.

29
00:03:11,62 --> 00:03:18,38
We discovered that there were plans to log the forests and loading at that stage meant pretty filling and burning.

30
00:03:18,38 --> 00:03:21,6
And replacing with. Eucalypt forest.

31
00:03:21,6 --> 00:03:26,78
Which twenty years later now it has been discovered to be not a very effective system.

32
00:03:26,78 --> 00:03:30,28
Because the other various timber problems but you can see at the time that it was.

33
00:03:31,03 --> 00:03:35,55
Wasn't a good thing to do to create fill a very complex ecosystem and replace it with a monoculture.

34
00:03:36,42 --> 00:03:43,35
But the prevailing forestry i think at the time was to do this. So i made it reaction was. Terror and.

35
00:03:44,08 --> 00:03:50,1
And need to fought. Actually our initial reaction was to run i have to admit. So land.

36
00:03:50,78 --> 00:03:55,37
But by coincidence a number of people had moved into this area at the same time and.

37
00:03:55,37 --> 00:04:02,42
Just by discussing with other people within days. Card should come back and. We felt yes we would fought this.

38
00:04:02,42 --> 00:04:06,19
And it sprang very quickly the spirit of fighting this issue.

39
00:04:06,19 --> 00:04:13,51
Came to get a very quickly with quite a small bunch of people. That gave me hope the fact that so many people could.

40
00:04:13,51 --> 00:04:15,68
Feel encouraged and feel they might even win.

41
00:04:16,03 --> 00:04:21,26
But i think at the time we had no idea what sort of battle we were talking about what sort of money what sort of toll

42
00:04:21,26 --> 00:04:29,03
in terms of relationships. Money. General lives. It was a really big thing to take on which.

43
00:04:29,03 --> 00:04:38,76
Maybe i wouldn't have done if i'd known how bad it would be yet since i worried about that title for a long time.

44
00:04:38,76 --> 00:04:46,13
The defense of my own backyard is something that i've worried about for some time. Because this is the main accusation.

45
00:04:46,13 --> 00:04:50,94
Thrown at greens. But now i realize that x. Very defensible it's.

46
00:04:50,94 --> 00:04:55,45
It's quite ok to fight for your own backyard infect you everyone should fight for their own backyard

47
00:04:55,45 --> 00:04:59,7
and maybe if we all did that and didn't worry about the global issues. So much.

48
00:04:59,7 --> 00:05:04,94
We could have a consciousness of global issues but if we really concentrated our energies on our local issues.

49
00:05:05,77 --> 00:05:06,33
Something could be done.

50
00:05:08,03 --> 00:05:14,82
And so now i feel much more confident that we can really fought for a very small issue it might even be one tree on the

51
00:05:14,82 --> 00:05:18,07
street. Or it might be in this case. Before thousand activists.

52
00:05:18,61 --> 00:05:22,1
But all of these issues can be fought with enormous vehemence and spirit.

53
00:05:22,1 --> 00:05:26,36
By the people that are most intimately involved. And they're the ones that go on for years.

54
00:05:26,36 --> 00:05:30,79
You get the residents that have lived at a place for fifty years and they're still fighting for the same piece.

55
00:05:30,84 --> 00:05:36,83
I feel the same about this piece of forest that i fought for then. And now that it's on the national park control.

56
00:05:36,83 --> 00:05:40,97
I still worry about it. You know a very intimate relationship.

57
00:05:40,97 --> 00:05:46,07
And i still have arguments with national parks about the way they mesh the place.

58
00:05:46,07 --> 00:05:50,85
Because although we've changed bureaucracies the still the same problem that.

59
00:05:50,85 --> 00:05:58,74
The same concept that the park is there for human use. And we haven't yet switched to this. Major radical.

60
00:05:58,74 --> 00:06:04,96
Mind movement. That these places have got a right to exist. For their own sex the been there a long time without us.

61
00:06:04,96 --> 00:06:09,84
We're very light. Come on. And we don't have to think that we're the most important thing on the planet.

62
00:06:11,16 --> 00:06:24,39
So i still fought for that and yes. It's certainly a deep philosophical.

63
00:06:24,39 --> 00:06:29,62
Association with the idea that these places have a right to exist on their own. And i think.

64
00:06:29,62 --> 00:06:34,5
Along with being embarrassed about fighting for my own backyard i was embarrassed to admit that it might be a

65
00:06:34,5 --> 00:06:41,41
passionate or religious feeling for the land. But now. Again i'm much more confident about that and.

66
00:06:41,41 --> 00:06:46,51
The accusation that. The green movement is somehow religious. Has been thrown about very flippantly.

67
00:06:46,51 --> 00:06:50,53
But i think we can claim that. And not try to throw that away.

68
00:06:50,53 --> 00:06:54,97
Because what else have we got going for us with the demise of so many other religions.

69
00:06:56,09 --> 00:07:00,72
Something has to fill a place because humans do have a need for spirituality.

70
00:07:00,72 --> 00:07:05,03
And what can be more spiritual than the whole planet. So i feel.

71
00:07:05,03 --> 00:07:11,58
We have to grasp it and and fought for something maybe like crusaders which is a bit of a corny image but.

72
00:07:11,58 --> 00:07:26,16
I feel quite strongly that we have to think of ourselves as that. Can use.

73
00:07:29,13 --> 00:07:34,27
On this further on the spiritual side of things. I don't like to a spare.

74
00:07:34,27 --> 00:07:37,88
Obvious dogmas like the hypothesis even though.

75
00:07:37,88 --> 00:07:42,25
I feel that's completely plausible i think it's much more of a personal issue.

76
00:07:42,65 --> 00:07:48,14
But i just happen to have the same personal philosophy along with a lot of other people. And i guess you can call it.

77
00:07:48,14 --> 00:07:54,12
Deep ecology. That there is a name for it now. Well this dark green. Environmentalism a number of names.

78
00:07:54,12 --> 00:07:55,33
A lot of them a derogatory.

79
00:07:56,23 --> 00:08:02,56
But i feel happy to spells those and take them on on them on a very deep level because i feel that.

80
00:08:02,56 --> 00:08:09,84
We're just beginning to learn the dips of spirituality and. Emotional feeling that the aborigines had for the land.

81
00:08:10,13 --> 00:08:13,54
And i knew a bunny lived here twenty years i don't depend on it.

82
00:08:13,54 --> 00:08:19,59
Financially it's not my god it's not my food it's not any of those things but it's still terribly important to me.

83
00:08:19,59 --> 00:08:22,51
So i've got a glimmering of what it meant to those people.

84
00:08:22,89 --> 00:08:27,17
And i feel the more that people can have some sort of feeling for the land.

85
00:08:27,17 --> 00:08:29,91
The more hope we have got of rescuing the planet. Because it's.

86
00:08:29,91 --> 00:08:35,64
This divorce of feeling that has got us into big trouble now. And it's that.

87
00:08:35,64 --> 00:08:38,9
We've now got the land in the relationship that.

88
00:08:38,9 --> 00:08:44,67
The slaves and masters have been in where the master has all the rights and no responsibilities and.

89
00:08:44,67 --> 00:08:51,64
Sex can only really on the slave by destroying it. And that's what we found in australian relationships with land that.

90
00:08:51,64 --> 00:08:55,53
Unless you're doing something to it clearing it or plowing it you don't really own it.

91
00:08:55,88 --> 00:08:58,53
So we have to turn our attitudes to the land on.

92
00:08:58,53 --> 00:08:59,6
On their heads

93
00:08:59,6 --> 00:09:06,31
and include the land in our morality which is very difficult for most australians to feel because they've always had

94
00:09:06,31 --> 00:09:17,86
the frontier attitude that it's a battle. To conquer. Yes. It's very sad that that alienation exists.

95
00:09:17,86 --> 00:09:24,57
Because in the end it will be. Sounds during written doesn't it will be the death of us if we counting start including.

96
00:09:24,57 --> 00:09:29,96
The land. In the way we feel in the way we love. What hope of we've got.

97
00:09:29,96 --> 00:09:36,02
And this increasingly becomes a problem with the dominance of economics as the main mode of thinking that everything

98
00:09:36,02 --> 00:09:39,07
absolutely everything can be translated into.

99
00:09:39,07 --> 00:09:46,62
Dollar terms and so a couple of days ago ross killy talking about that the control of pollution and the.

100
00:09:46,62 --> 00:09:52,85
The reversal of the degradation in rivers has to be tied into economics and i just groaned. Thinking that.

101
00:09:52,85 --> 00:09:57,85
People need to do it for the rivers sake and for the land sec not because it's going to pay them

102
00:09:57,85 --> 00:10:09,84
or not pay them to do the right or wrong thing. That's right.

103
00:10:12,5 --> 00:10:18,48
Yes it's very disturbing especially when you realize that a lot of the activities that are actually degrading.

104
00:10:18,48 --> 00:10:20,96
Contribute to the. G.n.p.

105
00:10:20,96 --> 00:10:26,93
or The economy as a whole needs two things a non-compatible so we maybe have to start thinking about abandoning our

106
00:10:26,93 --> 00:10:28,22
economic system.

107
00:10:28,22 --> 00:10:35,00
Which is very difficult because the belief in perpetual growth is so profound that you virtually can't even bring it up

108
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:40,69
it's like saying. Mother's milk poisonous or something like that that just doesn't follow.

109
00:10:41,68 --> 00:10:48,69
But we need something as radical as that. And that's what i think the people that. Started working twenty years ago.

110
00:10:48,69 --> 00:10:55,09
Can still contribute a lot because they have that. Basically very radical idea that. The system has to go.

111
00:10:55,78 --> 00:10:57,35
And even though.

112
00:10:57,35 --> 00:11:00,8
I can see are entrenched in the system to some extent we've published books

113
00:11:00,8 --> 00:11:05,47
and we've printed them on paper that came from trees that were filled and we live in a wooden house

114
00:11:05,47 --> 00:11:10,94
and we use the postal system and always other things. I still feel that i can let that go.

115
00:11:10,94 --> 00:11:16,71
If i need to reduce can use it as a vehicle to change minds. But we don't have to be attached to it.

116
00:11:16,71 --> 00:11:21,43
We don't have to be attached to consumerism. As. Not on the a way of life but as an ethic.

117
00:11:21,43 --> 00:11:27,71
And as a duty to keep the economy going. Some of the good product propositions. We have to learn how to let go.

118
00:11:27,71 --> 00:11:32,03
And i think that's what neiman has. With all its problems and all its horrors.

119
00:11:32,03 --> 00:11:36,06
Has really taught a lot of people that you can let go and live a lot more simply.

120
00:11:37,49 --> 00:11:43,96
And another thing i feel very strongly about this. Possibly not. Not a secret from what we've just been talking about.

121
00:11:43,96 --> 00:11:47,25
But i feel strongly that. With all the problems in nimbin in this area.

122
00:11:48,51 --> 00:11:54,16
We didn't have to prove that we could actually solve the whole planet's problems in one go.

123
00:11:54,16 --> 00:11:59,95
It seems unfair to mates is to focus on the. Alcoholics and drug addicts in the streets.

124
00:11:59,95 --> 00:12:03,82
Because look at mainstream society you can't say it's. Squeaky clean it has no problems.

125
00:12:04,74 --> 00:12:09,84
So it's ok to have problems we just have to be proud of the things that that have occurred and a lot of that.

126
00:12:10,78 --> 00:12:14,95
Putting a crack into the main system. The assumption that consumerism is the only way to go.

127
00:12:15,68 --> 00:12:23,55
So i think there's a lot to be proud of. In the last twenty years since been into any creek and all the other issues.

128
00:12:23,55 --> 00:12:40,57
But. Gee there's an awful long way to go as well. And i hear from not in seventy four.

129
00:12:40,57 --> 00:12:45,62
Which is when you and i first discovered that the force was to be logged. There was a campaign.

130
00:12:45,62 --> 00:12:49,72
Until nine hundred seventy nine of. Just the conventional methods of fighting issues.

131
00:12:49,72 --> 00:12:57,53
That was endless letters to ministers endless. Submissions. Appeal for clemency. Invitations to visit the area.

132
00:12:57,53 --> 00:13:03,41
And so on all of which chinked away at the office of forestry expertise but.

133
00:13:03,41 --> 00:13:10,81
We didn't actually get to a point where we could even know that compromise to a certain extent. But we felt in view of.

134
00:13:10,81 --> 00:13:16,11
What was happening to the forests in this area this wasn't really a compromise. So we kept fighting.

135
00:13:16,11 --> 00:13:20,45
And it wasn't until almost the last minute when the blockade started to occur in september

136
00:13:20,45 --> 00:13:25,75
and nine hundred seventy nine that. That the group the main group called to runyon ninety four section group.

137
00:13:25,75 --> 00:13:28,16
Actually contemplated a blockade. We'd always feel.

138
00:13:29,27 --> 00:13:32,69
We must mean before then because the argument seemed to be so apparent.

139
00:13:33,26 --> 00:13:36,8
How could they not listen to what we are saying the naivety staggers me.

140
00:13:36,8 --> 00:13:41,05
We just felt that i would have to exceed to our demands because those so obvious.

141
00:13:41,05 --> 00:13:46,33
And so we didn't actually have a blockade planned at all we joked about it in very light hearted terms

142
00:13:46,33 --> 00:13:51,97
but no one had organized anything. And so when the crunch came and. The bulldozers were definitely coming.

143
00:13:52,63 --> 00:13:58,55
We put out a call at the local market which was a. Called the china market just a local market of crafts.

144
00:13:58,55 --> 00:14:06,59
People put out a call did a couple of minor bits of advertising. And bingo we had. I don't know how many people.

145
00:14:06,59 --> 00:14:09,84
There were at the first day but. About one hundred. Came almost immediately.

146
00:14:10,64 --> 00:14:15,92
Which really floors because we had no idea that be sure taken such a hold on people's imagination.

147
00:14:15,92 --> 00:14:21,7
And fortunately for the people in the to run a united force action group who had been working on the political side

148
00:14:21,7 --> 00:14:28,49
but neglected the social side. The people who came were very good at that stuff. A lot of them came from communities.

149
00:14:28,49 --> 00:14:32,76
And began to work out a social system. Extremely effectively.

150
00:14:32,76 --> 00:14:40,99
And also a physical system for the last aport for cooking washing. Water. Childminding health. Everything else.

151
00:14:40,99 --> 00:14:45,47
Staggered me how quickly they could get that together. And so we all.

152
00:14:45,47 --> 00:14:50,26
Tended to feed off each other we needed to be able to support each other because there were a lot of problems always in

153
00:14:50,26 --> 00:14:54,75
a bunch of people like that there are a lot of personal problems and conflicts and.

154
00:14:54,75 --> 00:14:58,56
Difficulties in solving them especially if you work on the consensus. System and don't have a hierarchy.

155
00:15:00,06 --> 00:15:01,24
So there were problems but.

156
00:15:01,24 --> 00:15:07,13
It was an extremely exciting time when we all felt very strongly that we were doing something very important

157
00:15:07,13 --> 00:15:20,53
and historic. The blockade went on for. I think two or three weeks it's hard to remember not so long ago.

158
00:15:20,7 --> 00:15:25,93
I feel i should have these figures it in my memory but it was about that long.

159
00:15:25,93 --> 00:15:31,6
And not from from the very beginning there were some police involved but these numbers escalated very quickly

160
00:15:31,6 --> 00:15:40,31
when rand attempted to tough it out. And we got up to. Dozens of police at some stage and.

161
00:15:40,31 --> 00:15:45,8
How many twenty twenty petty wagons. We do have some photographs which are quite graphic of the number of.

162
00:15:45,8 --> 00:15:47,53
Blue shirts that they were there.

163
00:15:47,53 --> 00:15:53,06
And as always with all these demonstrations you had some extremely heavy police that were very intimidating.

164
00:15:53,06 --> 00:15:59,83
And on the other scale some who are very supportive. And just said i'm doing my job but. I agree with you.

165
00:15:59,83 --> 00:16:07,81
So there was quite a concerted campaign to tackle the police themselves on a personal level. Not on the gross of level.

166
00:16:07,81 --> 00:16:13,26
And i in particular had an experience when i. For once was up in the forest on my own just getting a bit of.

167
00:16:13,26 --> 00:16:19,34
Because i was so exhausted and came across one of the upper echelon. Cops who was lost.

168
00:16:19,34 --> 00:16:26,93
And i thought oh he's my chance to lose this bastard and make it really embarrassing for and have to do good.

169
00:16:26,93 --> 00:16:31,77
So i in fact chatted with him and talked with him and he was a nice bloke. And laid him out of the forest.

170
00:16:31,77 --> 00:16:36,28
And i think he was grateful because he realised he was very vulnerable. He didn't know the bushies.

171
00:16:36,28 --> 00:16:42,94
Come from somewhere else and he felt the fright of the place or as i felt as if i was in my living room. So.

172
00:16:42,94 --> 00:16:53,88
So at home in pieces or just talking to them treating them like people.

173
00:16:53,88 --> 00:16:59,08
And listening which i've learned subsequently is absolutely vital.

174
00:16:59,08 --> 00:17:04,56
Not to even try and put your ideas across just ask questions and ask how it is for them.

175
00:17:04,56 --> 00:17:10,88
And sometimes you get an enormous. Russia feeling from that person because they may never have been listened to before.

176
00:17:10,88 --> 00:17:17,14
And i particularly noticed this that noddy which was a later. Demonstration for another piece of forest nearby.

177
00:17:18,03 --> 00:17:18,92
When a group of demonstrators

178
00:17:18,92 --> 00:17:24,24
and into the prohibited area of forest where there were some lovers guarding some equipment.

179
00:17:24,24 --> 00:17:30,13
Not that we were threatening it anyway. And some people attacked them verbal a not abusing but.

180
00:17:30,13 --> 00:17:34,51
Yelling arguments at them. And you could see the reaction was a brick wall.

181
00:17:34,51 --> 00:17:39,16
But i perceive that if i just listen to one of the chaps in particular the one with the government on the one who is

182
00:17:39,16 --> 00:17:43,85
really likely to let fly with a fist talking to him he would come down

183
00:17:43,85 --> 00:17:50,07
and it was true it was black magic just listening to his grievances. And finding out what was going on for them was.

184
00:17:50,07 --> 00:17:55,78
Was very important because they have got extremely important grievances that non was listening to.

185
00:17:55,78 --> 00:18:01,55
Still feel strongly that the people at the bottom of the ranks in forestry and in the logging camp.

186
00:18:01,55 --> 00:18:04,26
Other ones that get victimized. All along the line.

187
00:18:04,26 --> 00:18:09,84
They're the ones that get thrown out when you get a mule rationalisations one real taking over another the black.

188
00:18:10,13 --> 00:18:12,58
Dumped it's the bottom blocks that get dumped every time.

189
00:18:12,58 --> 00:18:15,72
When you get a big new machine it's the list skilled ones that get dumped every time.

190
00:18:16,62 --> 00:18:22,97
And now they felt they were being victimised by the greens as well so they were just in an absolutely no win situation.

191
00:18:22,97 --> 00:18:27,49
So i think we few started listening to someone and listen to what they were worried about.

192
00:18:27,49 --> 00:18:34,57
They had plenty to say and we needed to hear that stuff. We couldn't just fourth down ideas on to them.

193
00:18:34,57 --> 00:18:41,45
Because comparatively. The green side. Was more had more internal support.

194
00:18:41,45 --> 00:18:48,96
We had formulated ideas to a certain extent and had a quite a good network of people who knew who felt the same way.

195
00:18:48,96 --> 00:18:52,88
But these logging. Blocks. Felt isolated you could see it.

196
00:18:52,88 --> 00:18:56,74
Very isolated and very threatened and of course your threatened if your livelihood looks like.

197
00:18:56,74 --> 00:18:58,18
Getting shot from under you.

198
00:18:58,18 --> 00:19:03,93
And they're not expecting from us that's written by the mill owner ship as well as we've seen. Subsequently this huge.

199
00:19:03,93 --> 00:19:08,97
Employment losses with these mills are the closing down and taking other mills

200
00:19:08,97 --> 00:19:12,42
or putting in new machines to dusty's book so they were very threatened and.

201
00:19:12,42 --> 00:19:31,22
I think we could have done more in that school. More listening and more actually physically helping these people.

202
00:19:34,18 --> 00:19:39,55
I think the creek in them out knotty issues. Were very formative in bringing.

203
00:19:39,55 --> 00:19:44,85
Many of the greens together and a lot of green thought. But i don't think we can take the credit for.

204
00:19:44,85 --> 00:19:50,49
A lot of the green movement in the area i think that was something that was coming anyway. It was. It was quite clear.

205
00:19:50,49 --> 00:19:55,42
But at the time. The green movement did feel that they support from sydney wasn't forthcoming.

206
00:19:55,66 --> 00:20:02,14
And there's the certainly the urban. Todd. That is that. Certain todd.

207
00:20:02,14 --> 00:20:09,03
Green movement that compared with us was very straight and we certainly looked like the dirty. People in the hills.

208
00:20:09,03 --> 00:20:16,2
Which wasn't true but it. Just the image that. Came across at the time. And so we needed. That the city.

209
00:20:16,2 --> 00:20:22,76
Suited people to to help us help the media realize that in fact. This was a very widespread movement.

210
00:20:23,47 --> 00:20:24,6
Unfortunately when.

211
00:20:24,6 --> 00:20:30,48
Of course the people up here were talking to the media always the cameras go to the most why outlooking crazies.

212
00:20:30,7 --> 00:20:36,86
But the bulk of the movement wasn't base. Wasn't these people it was very straight. Lives more people and.

213
00:20:36,86 --> 00:20:38,14
The people in this area.

214
00:20:38,14 --> 00:20:44,49
In the valleys themselves who might have dressed in suits and ties but had a very well thought up philosophy

215
00:20:44,49 --> 00:20:51,59
and a lot of. A lot of thinking going into the way that they were operating. And also a lot of professional and.

216
00:20:51,59 --> 00:21:00,79
Other expertise. Plenty of people with also advertising in advertising training or. Photographic training or.

217
00:21:00,79 --> 00:21:06,02
Teaching training or. Media training all sorts of different skills that we could apply to the situation.

218
00:21:12,16 --> 00:21:22,25
Yes it's something to be proud of. I think we need. This eerie has had a reputation for breeding. Green extremists.

219
00:21:22,25 --> 00:21:27,82
Which i think is something we can be extremely proud of in fact is not to show that you can buy put out by the local

220
00:21:27,82 --> 00:21:32,22
environments into. Saying green extremists. So that's a good thing but.

221
00:21:32,22 --> 00:21:38,91
I'm a bit worried that the green extremists idea may get hijacked by commercialism and.

222
00:21:38,91 --> 00:21:43,57
Be sold is a nice idea but we really don't have to do anything. Very constructive about this.

223
00:21:43,57 --> 00:21:50,14
And i think that's something that the whole movement in this area has to really worry about that. Our opposition.

224
00:21:50,14 --> 00:21:52,44
The world of economics and.

225
00:21:52,44 --> 00:21:57,4
Commercialism and large bureaucracies that are intent on doing the same as i've always done.

226
00:21:57,4 --> 00:22:03,21
These people have now got the skills to use great ideas. Against us.

227
00:22:03,21 --> 00:22:09,84
And so that the normal person in the street thinks they're doing something useful by using on top.

228
00:22:10,19 --> 00:22:14,47
Paper and feel good about it. But a basically still a major part of the problem.

229
00:22:15,26 --> 00:22:17,97
So i think that's the next challenge for us.

230
00:22:17,97 --> 00:22:23,43
We appear to have had a major green that looks like people really care about this. These issues.

231
00:22:23,43 --> 00:22:45,05
But underneath it all has been a very minor change and. That's what we have to work on the story.

232
00:22:55,75 --> 00:23:01,02
There's certainly been a very strong and green movement. Coming to being since the.

233
00:23:01,02 --> 00:23:04,31
Especially that to any great battle. Where for a start.

234
00:23:04,31 --> 00:23:10,45
We were hidden because we had all the innovative ideas such as using advertising which hadn't been thought of for a

235
00:23:10,45 --> 00:23:17,25
green issue before. So we were hit on that score but now. There's a problem with the backlash. To that and.

236
00:23:17,25 --> 00:23:23,5
An increasing sophistication of. Technics from large bureaucracy such as advertising and.

237
00:23:23,5 --> 00:23:26,47
Getting across what i consider to be false information.

238
00:23:26,47 --> 00:23:31,88
But i'm not too concerned about the backlash against green movement scene the general population i think that is

239
00:23:31,88 --> 00:23:37,56
actually diminishing and. Green ideas are increasing because the evidence is so apparent.

240
00:23:37,56 --> 00:23:45,97
We don't have to pretend that it's not happening. So i think the violent. And he green movements. Will go in time.

241
00:23:45,97 --> 00:23:52,57
But we have to deal with to mediate future is the apathy and the belief that it's all ok.

242
00:23:52,7 --> 00:23:59,67
So i think you get people like the more extreme members of the force your protection. Society. Association.

243
00:23:59,67 --> 00:24:09,84
Should know these terms such as rage. What's that rational. Action against green. Extremists.

244
00:24:10,21 --> 00:24:12,46
Rational action i think against green extremists.

245
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:19,73
I can see where these people come from that come from a position of fear and. Powerlessness and.

246
00:24:19,73 --> 00:24:25,92
It's easy to attribute causes and the green one green. The greens are the most obvious cause.

247
00:24:25,92 --> 00:24:32,11
So they will continue to be a problem but. That will diminish. What we have to guard against increasing apathy.

248
00:24:33,76 --> 00:24:38,86
Such as it's quite obvious that the greenhouse effect having a big impact on public consciousness for the first year

249
00:24:38,86 --> 00:24:59,04
or two that was talked about and it's not discussed too openly. Oh. So you know.

250
00:25:09,38 --> 00:25:14,75
Yes the green movement certainly has to start offering some positive alternatives. We have been saying.

251
00:25:14,75 --> 00:25:21,53
No for a very long time and. Unfortunately. Getting the image of course there were very negative and.

252
00:25:21,53 --> 00:25:24,96
Against everything. But i think that's reasonable.

253
00:25:24,96 --> 00:25:31,13
Not to have the solutions when you're pointing to a problem it's like a doctor saying you've got cancer and.

254
00:25:31,13 --> 00:25:33,76
They mightn't have the answers but they still have to point out that you've got a problem.

255
00:25:34,57 --> 00:25:39,96
So i think it's reasonable for us to do that. But of course. To increase public.

256
00:25:39,96 --> 00:25:43,13
Credibility we do have to provide more in the way of positive answers.

257
00:25:43,13 --> 00:25:48,25
Not that we haven't been doing this for some time talking about reforestation being. Number one priority.

258
00:25:48,84 --> 00:25:52,74
You know as area with. Huge percentage of degraded land that we have.

259
00:25:52,74 --> 00:25:58,47
This is obviously a big question which could solve a lot of employment problem solving their relation problem.

260
00:25:58,47 --> 00:26:04,12
Solve a lot of planetary problems. So we haven't been neglecting this issue but we have to do it more effectively.

261
00:26:04,12 --> 00:26:09,84
And i think. As far as i'm concerned the economics is a major problem. And so the green people have.

262
00:26:10,42 --> 00:26:17,18
Showed more explicitly how to leave. Very softly on the earth. And this means. Scaling down.

263
00:26:17,18 --> 00:26:19,63
Economic involvement out of a desire to have things.

264
00:26:19,63 --> 00:26:25,47
And becoming really socially mobile as some of the people on bodie have suggested it's a very good idea that we have to

265
00:26:25,47 --> 00:26:30,87
stop aspiring to earn more things which obviously have a terminal impact on the planet.

266
00:26:31,45 --> 00:26:35,4
So we have to sever ties the economic system. From within.

267
00:26:35,4 --> 00:26:39,35
And this will have enormous ramifications for the forestry industry apart from anything else.

268
00:26:40,92 --> 00:26:44,21
We're not saying don't use trees we're saying. Use an awful lot less.

269
00:26:44,21 --> 00:26:46,98
The me at the moment that goes for everything else as well.

270
00:26:46,98 --> 00:26:53,56
So i think of greens can show themselves to be capable of living lot the on the planet. And.

271
00:26:53,56 --> 00:26:57,51
Coming up with some alternative suggestions. They're going to look a lot more.

272
00:26:57,51 --> 00:27:03,56
Be looked on a lot more favorably by the general populace. At the moment we have a few people that consider that.

273
00:27:03,56 --> 00:27:08,27
Having a rosewood table is ok if you had a rosewood. But as far as i'm concerned.

274
00:27:08,27 --> 00:27:11,2
One seedling doesn't make will one thousand year old tree.

275
00:27:11,2 --> 00:27:18,81
We have to do a lot more than that we have to start using pine. For instance which you and i've done in this house.

276
00:27:18,81 --> 00:27:23,54
Because those ponds are in the ground now we should use them and not keep using the old force that.

277
00:27:23,54 --> 00:27:30,18
No matter how great it sowed to plant a tree is just really not going to work. We have to back off for some period now.

278
00:27:30,18 --> 00:27:32,1
That these forests and.

279
00:27:32,1 --> 00:27:38,67
Indeed the whole country recover from the difficult one because you can see the economic impact will be enormous.

280
00:27:38,67 --> 00:27:44,4
That's why we have to escape from this straight jacket. Of economic consciousness that we have at the moment.

281
00:27:44,4 --> 00:27:46,56
That that money is what will count.

282
00:27:46,56 --> 00:27:51,4
Money will get us out of our problems increased growth increased use of resources will get us out of these problems

283
00:27:51,4 --> 00:28:09,84
and. A child can say that. This is a nonsense. Working out how to stay green and be completely not here.

284
00:28:10,22 --> 00:28:15,76
Critical and completely pure. Is extremely difficult and decide it is completely impossible.

285
00:28:15,76 --> 00:28:21,46
And for a long time of being vulnerable to the accusation of. Well you drive a car.

286
00:28:21,46 --> 00:28:25,35
You wear shoes you walk on wooden floors.

287
00:28:25,84 --> 00:28:33,56
And i still worry about that one not still want to be as pure as possible while realizing that if i was obsessed with.

288
00:28:33,56 --> 00:28:35,9
Consuming things i'd been out on the. Contributing to the g.n.p.

289
00:28:35,9 --> 00:28:42,81
but I'd be untroubled by feelings if you talk to see i would not since. Be a good person.

290
00:28:42,81 --> 00:28:47,26
Whereas now i feel that if i cut a tree down on my property to make a fence post.

291
00:28:47,26 --> 00:28:52,28
I'm somehow involved in a you know hypocrisy. But i'm coming to terms with that. And i think.

292
00:28:52,28 --> 00:28:57,68
All i can do is use my base and. Most people in fact do that all the time.

293
00:28:57,68 --> 00:29:05,52
But we greens have to be even more aware of that and not let ourselves slip into into bad ways. But i'm aware that.

294
00:29:05,52 --> 00:29:11,83
You know no history for instance we produce. Hundreds of thousands of trees every year. Sounds like a great idea.

295
00:29:11,83 --> 00:29:13,34
But we use plastic pots.

296
00:29:13,79 --> 00:29:21,78
We use recycled ones where we can but we still use some new ones so we're very open to accusations of. Bad practices.

297
00:29:21,78 --> 00:29:25,18
Because i haven't personally investigated the factory that makes these plastic pots

298
00:29:25,18 --> 00:29:29,46
and no doubt it's dumping it's learned into the local creek who know us.

299
00:29:29,46 --> 00:29:36,05
And where you send that strange from the river. And no doubt the sands there because the slopes have been cleared.

300
00:29:36,05 --> 00:29:39,21
And so. I'm still responsible for everything that goes on.

301
00:29:39,21 --> 00:29:44,46
I'm really aware that i personally have got a stake in the whole degradation of the planet.

302
00:29:44,46 --> 00:29:52,1
So although this can give you an enormous load of guilt. You have to somehow. Put that on the one shoulder.

303
00:29:52,1 --> 00:29:55,74
Not have it on bus shoulders. So use your guilt as a motivator.

304
00:29:55,74 --> 00:30:01,06
Motivating force to keep you as clean as you possibly can but don't be overwhelmed by it

305
00:30:01,06 --> 00:30:07,23
and that is the trick for almost all the greens i now know operating the veterans of these old campaigns.

306
00:30:07,23 --> 00:30:13,97
Of how to manage the guilt button. And the. Hypocrisy burden. And still be effective. Positive. Happy.

307
00:30:13,97 --> 00:30:20,07
People who know they've got an issue to work on. And don't want to be crippled by. The feelings that.

308
00:30:20,07 --> 00:30:23,76
The maybe something wrong with what they're doing. For instance i use a car.

309
00:30:23,76 --> 00:30:30,11
And i'm very aware of that that i would step a lot more likely on the planet if i walked instead of driving.

310
00:30:30,44 --> 00:30:33,25
But the problems of the moment are so crucial that you have to shortcut

311
00:30:33,25 --> 00:30:41,43
and second use the paraphernalia of the opposition. To thought it. So that's why i use a computer which no doubt.

312
00:30:41,43 --> 00:30:47,83
Had see if c's involved in its manufacture. The list of people proceeds is endless.

313
00:30:47,83 --> 00:31:01,22
I just try to get them under control. Thank you. It's a very sore. Looking back now after twenty years.

314
00:31:01,22 --> 00:31:03,38
From an experiment. On.

315
00:31:03,38 --> 00:31:10,58
I've come to the conclusion that the ethics and ideas of the original newton people were and are still correct.

316
00:31:10,58 --> 00:31:17,89
But often they are. Thwarted by just the prevailing lack of energy and hopelessness even of a lot of people.

317
00:31:17,89 --> 00:31:20,5
Now unfortunately the people who are doing all the destroying of the planet.

318
00:31:21,39 --> 00:31:22,5
The ones that got all the energy

319
00:31:22,5 --> 00:31:29,49
and initiative other ones have got precisely the wrong ideas about stimulating the economy and consuming more and.
