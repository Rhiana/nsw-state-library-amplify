1
00:00:18,89 --> 00:00:25,7
Well tangible has. A why of screening. People i guess you'd say. That is that.

2
00:00:25,7 --> 00:00:33,75
Anybody that wants to move on to that community has to meet. To try and and just gossip briefly.

3
00:00:35,02 --> 00:00:39,92
And then it's up to the tribe. And the hamlet that you're actually moving on to.

4
00:00:39,92 --> 00:00:46,39
So when are you drawn to the hamlet of. I had to meet all the managers and talk with them.

5
00:00:46,39 --> 00:00:54,3
It was a safety mechanism for me because i could soon sauce out but i wasn't living next door to a shotgun. And.

6
00:00:56,12 --> 00:01:05,34
They could sauce out the dollars a peace loving hippie tart. To say it was a great safety valve. And then for bonding.

7
00:01:05,34 --> 00:01:09,66
It's a matter of having to rent there first for twelve months and.

8
00:01:09,66 --> 00:01:16,24
I feel that's really cool and i'm sure that's why the families are so contented and.

9
00:01:16,24 --> 00:01:18,69
Don't have to carry a great deal of defense around with them.

10
00:01:19,76 --> 00:01:25,08
My house or collars like i think ninety eight percent of the houses on timetable. It doesn't have a lock.

11
00:01:26,33 --> 00:01:35,31
And i've never had any trouble with people using the house. If you walking by people not used to dani.

12
00:01:35,31 --> 00:01:41,07
But there's certainly not in your living room or having cups of tea

13
00:01:41,07 --> 00:02:00,91
or stealing things i've had a lot of travel with my modified. House it's quite on the off. That it's. Yes.

14
00:02:00,91 --> 00:02:06,34
Most of the house is a set back into a rainforest and so they're very private and all that

15
00:02:06,34 --> 00:02:09,71
and i visit quite close we can actually save them.

16
00:02:09,71 --> 00:02:13,2
If i was to yell off madhur and i might hear me

17
00:02:13,2 --> 00:02:19,78
and i can certainly hear one of my knives singing often implying the guitar. Fortunately has a good voice and.

18
00:02:19,78 --> 00:02:28,96
Plays guitar well. But yes rain forest. It becomes quite a leap in the wet season.

19
00:02:28,96 --> 00:02:36,26
And we have about eight or twelve weeks of that. Each year and. So they can get a bit muddy under thought.

20
00:02:36,26 --> 00:02:43,71
Rain boot country. But for the rest of the it's very beautiful and. We have many trees from all over the world and.

21
00:02:43,71 --> 00:02:49,73
Coffees ground there and. Lots of exotic plants that.

22
00:02:49,73 --> 00:02:55,21
You don't see in many places other than the potential garden and it is this love for the earth.

23
00:02:55,21 --> 00:03:06,46
That people have brought back. Things from other countries and grown up there and it's fantastic.

24
00:03:07,8 --> 00:03:22,68
Yes we have a tribal council which is very similar to any council that. Looks after a body of people. And the tribe.

25
00:03:22,68 --> 00:03:32,39
Insists that there's no real profit making on real estate there. The house that i mean. Has a set price and.

26
00:03:33,26 --> 00:03:39,72
The only couldn't put upon herself that it was worth twenty thousand more because you know.

27
00:03:39,72 --> 00:03:45,3
Neighbors' houses are worth twenty thousand or more if it hasn't gone up with the rest of inflation.

28
00:03:46,17 --> 00:03:53,46
And so the average house there would be about twenty ten to twenty thousand dollars which is very realistic.

29
00:03:53,46 --> 00:03:57,89
In this neighborhood because if you're looking at a few acres on your own with a constable do well

30
00:03:57,89 --> 00:04:01,94
when you might be looking at seventy or eighty thousand dollars.

31
00:04:01,94 --> 00:04:09,16
So it makes it very realistic for young parents to move on and to. Want to start having children.

32
00:04:09,16 --> 00:04:14,36
Because they haven't got that. Huge mold each to have to worry about or tend to.

33
00:04:14,36 --> 00:04:16,81
And it means to a lot more time spent with.

34
00:04:16,85 --> 00:04:22,69
The children and i think that's why the kids are walking around quite contented they do see a lot of dad

35
00:04:22,69 --> 00:04:34,94
and they do see a lot of mom. And it's cry. That says. Oh yes there is a shared to share system.

36
00:04:34,94 --> 00:04:40,56
And to buy shares the intangible share costs five hundred dollars still and.

37
00:04:40,56 --> 00:04:43,83
I'm sure that's been a stable price now for ten.

38
00:04:43,83 --> 00:04:45,15
Ten years or fifteen years

39
00:04:45,15 --> 00:04:53,61
or even the whole existence of it is most probably doing something very realistic life that you see.

40
00:04:56,8 --> 00:05:20,06
It's just a question. It's a question. So. My views on poverty. As such happiness and joy and.

41
00:05:20,06 --> 00:05:28,14
I see a lot of happiness there. And i don't see a lot of new commodores or. Shiny lawnmowers that you see it on.

42
00:05:28,14 --> 00:05:36,29
And i guess. Values are looked upon as slightly different than how they might be looked upon in a city where the news.

43
00:05:36,29 --> 00:05:39,81
Is certainly a value on tangible.

44
00:05:39,81 --> 00:05:44,78
I guess we'll fortunate to have two all four wheels that are still managing to get across the roads.

45
00:05:44,78 --> 00:05:50,63
To get the kids off to high school or. To get around to do the shopping.

46
00:05:51,54 --> 00:05:58,28
But the commune itself is actually very good it has its own vast vast shelter and.

47
00:05:58,28 --> 00:06:03,98
That's set up for people that haven't got cars for the single moms that i have cause for the kids that just want to go

48
00:06:03,98 --> 00:06:10,81
to newman and apply on opinion or whatever they consider the bus shelter. And as.

49
00:06:10,81 --> 00:06:16,81
As a driver myself when i drive past the vast older his ever sitting there it's like a cabaret.

50
00:06:16,86 --> 00:06:22,59
If it was this is the first one on my motorbike or if i have room for three in my car.

51
00:06:22,59 --> 00:06:26,79
It can fit the first three in and.

52
00:06:26,79 --> 00:06:28,86
I've never seen people drive past me

53
00:06:28,86 --> 00:06:34,58
when i want to go to town if it's pouring rain i don't want to sit on my motorbike. I sit in the bus shelter and.

54
00:06:34,58 --> 00:06:38,17
The first car that goes possibly the car that picks me up.

55
00:06:38,17 --> 00:06:45,1
And i really like that aspect and life was for the return journey from them than to tangible. Isn't a problem.

56
00:06:46,7 --> 00:06:59,85
First lift all over town. Yet. On tangible people. Their food. And is a lot of food grown men air.

57
00:07:00,32 --> 00:07:07,05
And it is massive orchards there to make massive sums of money.

58
00:07:07,05 --> 00:07:10,65
They're there for people to pick the man drains or the pages.

59
00:07:10,65 --> 00:07:17,19
When they're riding past on their horse or walking past on. Force. And i like that idea and.

60
00:07:17,19 --> 00:07:23,51
I don't think i've ever left and without holding onto the caney apartheid. Or something.

61
00:07:23,51 --> 00:07:39,71
And it's usually a little bag of. Vegetables which is fantastic. Oh yes i guess. My favorite story.

62
00:07:39,71 --> 00:07:49,52
For tangible would be ok. You have one of the best times for me.

63
00:07:49,52 --> 00:07:54,91
Time to vote was when i took my mother out there with my niece and nephew and.

64
00:07:54,91 --> 00:08:02,95
They spent the day there and we walked all over the commune and saw. Most probably one hundred houses and.

65
00:08:02,95 --> 00:08:09,88
Welling's where people live. And when we were leaving. Dawn who is quite middle class and quite sydney.

66
00:08:09,88 --> 00:08:16,81
Said to my niece and nephew i bet you didn't expect when we drove into this valley to meet so many interesting people.

67
00:08:16,86 --> 00:08:24,5
To see so many beautiful dwellings and. I think that was a wonderful story because.

68
00:08:25,21 --> 00:08:30,53
Dorn had never seen anything like that before. And she fell in love with it.

69
00:08:30,53 --> 00:08:34,21
And i thought that was very very good because there is no curbing gathering

70
00:08:34,21 --> 00:08:40,35
and there are no electricity power poles running along. And that. One can feel i only invaded.

71
00:08:40,35 --> 00:08:42,07
Without those things i guess.

72
00:08:42,07 --> 00:08:47,87
After living with them for sixty surfer do want to feel very comfortable there immediately.

73
00:08:47,87 --> 00:09:02,27
And to get the vibe of the place immediately. I thought was a wonderful thing. Perth.

74
00:09:08,43 --> 00:09:21,58
Godly eccentricities to call those people that. I think most people see themselves as doing what they want to do.

75
00:09:21,58 --> 00:09:28,61
One of their childhood dreams one of their adult dreams. They cannot leave it there. And it's not at a great cost.

76
00:09:28,61 --> 00:09:31,68
Like the dream about one hundred foot yacht of all.

77
00:09:31,68 --> 00:09:39,52
The mansion on the hill can often be very frustrating graeme because you spend a lifetime trying to get to that.

78
00:09:39,52 --> 00:09:43,18
And a tangible that's more realistic. So people can. Out and.

79
00:09:43,18 --> 00:09:46,61
They can live their dream they can bring their children math.

80
00:09:46,61 --> 00:09:52,56
Or in my case they can walk around feeling very comfortable being who i am and.

81
00:09:52,56 --> 00:09:55,98
I think that's good to have such a neighborhood on the planet.

82
00:09:59,18 --> 00:10:16,81
And yes i think people intangible do have a very high level of tolerance and that's go right. I'm sure at the end of.

83
00:10:17,04 --> 00:10:19,16
People go outside the guidelines if that.

84
00:10:19,16 --> 00:10:27,32
If they have not if they're having problems within their domestic life

85
00:10:27,32 --> 00:10:32,36
or within the night the law if it's very common i think on the outside.

86
00:10:32,36 --> 00:10:41,02
To just call the police or to clean coal and inspect durrell to get the outside to actually piii and. To work out.

87
00:10:41,02 --> 00:10:49,2
The decision making. I find it time to pull a lot of it's. Have to leave and worked out with dean and.

88
00:10:49,2 --> 00:10:51,85
I've only seen success stories through it.

89
00:10:51,85 --> 00:10:56,89
And yes it must be very frustrating while those people are in such a dilemma.

90
00:10:56,89 --> 00:11:04,33
But i certainly have the time to post a video with it and give it. The time to post the view. And. Yeah.

91
00:11:04,33 --> 00:11:24,08
Saying that it's cool to think you know if it's true.

92
00:11:24,08 --> 00:11:40,48
It's actually not but of course we markus it doesn't really run you probably not for us. Ok.

93
00:11:40,48 --> 00:11:45,2
All right mark jackson then i moved to mumbai.

94
00:11:45,2 --> 00:11:51,25
Just because it seemed like a nice thing to do for awakened at the time and. There was.

95
00:11:51,25 --> 00:11:58,41
Rod savella with the supplies truck that was put in bringing supplies down to the crew who were making the preparations

96
00:11:58,41 --> 00:12:00,55
for the festival and.

97
00:12:00,55 --> 00:12:16,81
About two and a half months before the first we were kind to waken than twenty years down the track i'm still here.

98
00:12:16,96 --> 00:12:22,23
It was really just a nice thing to do for wake in the you know nost trip to the countryside and.

99
00:12:22,72 --> 00:12:26,87
I guess i just fell in love with the environment around. Nimbin and.

100
00:12:26,87 --> 00:12:31,32
We used to come down the back road through the known by valley so that.

101
00:12:31,32 --> 00:12:36,89
Even on the trip down you know it was like going through a problem a whole jungle compared to what i was used to

102
00:12:36,89 --> 00:12:42,2
brisbane. Being a bit of a concrete jungle. So i was a complete contrast and.

103
00:12:42,2 --> 00:12:46,64
I think it was really a matter of falling in love with the environment really that.

104
00:12:47,45 --> 00:12:58,83
And i mean joy coming and caused me to stay i think i was probably you know ten or fifteen years before that.

105
00:12:58,83 --> 00:13:03,47
The two most thought of living in philly dick and lost all

106
00:13:03,47 --> 00:13:09,99
and i think it had a lot to do with the fact that i saw that. I was living in tents lead to couldn't.

107
00:13:09,99 --> 00:13:16,87
Civilization is a means of production and was sort of by stone on its own demise and.

108
00:13:16,87 --> 00:13:24,79
I think the concept in the future which was that the concept that. The punk generation sort of. Brought to light.

109
00:13:24,79 --> 00:13:33,93
Was you know a strong perception in a lot of the time so it basically you know working in a mental hospital and.

110
00:13:33,93 --> 00:13:39,75
Drinking a lot and. Doing various other bad things to my body and.

111
00:13:39,75 --> 00:13:48,57
Moving to newman was just like getting back in contact with life you know sort of being connected with night.

112
00:13:48,57 --> 00:13:57,2
And looking at how useless i was a realisation that i'd been trying to be someone i sits at a desk

113
00:13:57,2 --> 00:14:04,82
or does something similar to that and had no life skills whatever interns of. You know. Cooking. Building. You know.

114
00:14:04,82 --> 00:14:16,81
Doing anything that was immediately useful in the survival sense. Well it was a.

115
00:14:16,96 --> 00:14:20,72
Really the aquarius festival as such and in fact.

116
00:14:20,72 --> 00:14:27,28
By the time of the aquarius festival which is about three months after i arrived in nimbin.

117
00:14:27,28 --> 00:14:31,8
I didn't bother to go to the festival because by then i was living in a house that sot of town

118
00:14:31,8 --> 00:14:39,69
and was sort of in love with survival last stalls and the back tonight show movement that.

119
00:14:39,69 --> 00:14:43,11
Of us that we couldn't be bothered going to town to celebrate that.

120
00:14:43,11 --> 00:14:48,23
You know i was just quietly celebrating valma self the fact that i was living in the countryside.

121
00:14:58,03 --> 00:15:03,57
It was really a process of becoming involved in all of the price is that my cloth possible

122
00:15:03,57 --> 00:15:09,28
and trying to get involved with them in a you know holistic way i saw that. You know.

123
00:15:09,28 --> 00:15:15,6
Recognizing that are new to a child become involved in growing vegetables in burying shit cans in cooking and.

124
00:15:15,6 --> 00:15:19,69
You know that whole process. And you know applying that.

125
00:15:19,69 --> 00:15:28,03
That sort of holistic involvement with prices across all the areas of my life and. Probably in particular.

126
00:15:28,03 --> 00:15:33,07
Becoming involved in the tray so i call. If you like and.

127
00:15:33,07 --> 00:15:37,86
You know that the first contact thing wanting to make a musical instrument.

128
00:15:37,86 --> 00:15:44,73
A god that i knew and this is probably six months after the fistula so i was making dulcimers which are four string.

129
00:15:44,73 --> 00:15:52,34
Musical instruments from the appalachian mountains making mine obviously involve getting some woodworking tools in

130
00:15:52,34 --> 00:16:00,07
among the wood waiting tools that are the border was given was a chinese saw that i was given by the guy called sam

131
00:16:00,07 --> 00:16:07,99
across and the sawmill at the kind of all falls. Co-operative property before it was the total cop.

132
00:16:07,99 --> 00:16:13,91
He gave me a chance or and i was building a house by this time and.

133
00:16:13,91 --> 00:16:19,22
The guy who cleared the building saw it with his bulldozer. Offered me a job blogging and.

134
00:16:19,22 --> 00:16:20,69
Because i was building a timber house

135
00:16:20,69 --> 00:16:28,73
and various other reasons i thought that it was probably the fair thing to take the logan job so i did that industry

136
00:16:28,73 --> 00:16:39,17
for about two years and having been involved in cutting a lot of trees down i thought that i should plant some.

137
00:16:39,17 --> 00:16:42,96
What would have suited me at the time was to work for the government.

138
00:16:42,96 --> 00:16:47,66
You know toward rights of pipe time and get a bit more than a dollar and have the rest of the time frame

139
00:16:47,66 --> 00:16:52,95
but because there was nothing happening on those lawns i saw the radar station contracting business.

140
00:16:52,95 --> 00:16:59,65
By the tossing through the local newspapers and found that there was a very substantial demand from people who wanted.

141
00:16:59,65 --> 00:17:03,42
Trays planted on their way and. You were planted.

142
00:17:03,42 --> 00:17:13,21
The five thousand trays for you know a hundred different landowners over the next five years. And until that.

143
00:17:13,21 --> 00:17:14,96
Business was cleaned up in the recession.

144
00:17:14,96 --> 00:17:22,83
You ninety three at which time i had a bad back chronic tin ear and about five thousand dollars worth of debts and

145
00:17:22,83 --> 00:17:23,54
when up to brisbane

146
00:17:23,54 --> 00:17:35,04
and worked in a box for a couple of years to get myself back on with a building the house was quite an experience

147
00:17:35,04 --> 00:17:43,4
because we did it in. Nine seventy four which was the you know the biggest. Flood that we've had in in recent times.

148
00:17:43,4 --> 00:17:47,6
And so it did run through fairly solidly for about five months.

149
00:17:47,6 --> 00:17:53,64
But it was a great experience you know sort of picking up building skills as. As you go along.

150
00:17:55,00 --> 00:18:00,25
Using the materials that kind of and like the whole house cost. Over the order of a thousand dollars to get.

151
00:18:00,25 --> 00:18:03,14
You know the basic house structure up. So that.

152
00:18:03,14 --> 00:18:10,09
For example we have products in the house were split added trays on the property and then brought extra nads to.

153
00:18:10,09 --> 00:18:16,81
You know. Provide a sort of thought by five. Refuse and. You know lots of second hand materials for.

154
00:18:16,9 --> 00:18:21,49
So i call materials and it turned out quite a beautiful structure and.

155
00:18:21,49 --> 00:18:26,65
Well while we didn't have any of accolades that time and. It's good for about.

156
00:18:26,65 --> 00:18:38,97
I think fifteen years and had one child born in a blasted well and. You know gave a lot of people.

157
00:18:38,97 --> 00:19:09,69
Shelter and satisfaction with it and i think. Nimbin was the thought because for all sorts of alternative ideas.

158
00:19:09,69 --> 00:19:17,31
And a lot of those ideas have now been co-opted into mind strange society either. You know.

159
00:19:17,31 --> 00:19:21,68
Fifteen twenty years ago if you write brown rice and so on you are some kind of fruit cake

160
00:19:21,68 --> 00:19:26,68
and now you could be the prime minister. A lot of the ideas that were looked on as.

161
00:19:26,68 --> 00:19:29,53
You know sort of wild and fanciful then.

162
00:19:29,53 --> 00:19:37,32
As i said now mind stream and environmental concern has set me in that category of thought is that where espoused.

163
00:19:37,32 --> 00:19:40,81
Strongly they. That are now at the consent of everyone.

164
00:19:40,81 --> 00:19:48,00
So i think that as a focus for alternative hardy as it said they played a substantial role in the environment movement.

165
00:19:49,17 --> 00:19:56,97
Also either the sun and been a lot of my gains in terms of forest issues not necessarily by people at nimbin

166
00:19:56,97 --> 00:20:03,44
but by people who are. You know. Among the alternative lifestyle community on the north coast and probably.

167
00:20:03,44 --> 00:20:06,09
Notably the community had to run a craig.

168
00:20:08,44 --> 00:20:16,81
The secession of rainforest logging in new south wales was largely a result of that protest and the subsequent protest.

169
00:20:17,07 --> 00:20:25,5
Matt not be against blogging in the not cat national what's now the not cat national park out there and.

170
00:20:25,5 --> 00:20:29,78
I was actually arrested there. On the the die before the.

171
00:20:29,78 --> 00:20:34,11
The decision was taken to stop writing for us logging in new south wales or.

172
00:20:34,11 --> 00:20:41,52
A decision that purported to stop rainforest logging in new south wales was taken. But i have to that.

173
00:20:41,52 --> 00:20:52,77
It's probably the one thing that needs to be said is that there are a great party.

174
00:20:52,77 --> 00:20:58,16
Yeah i think everyone is kind to the protests were all there was a lot of great about what was happening in the forests

175
00:20:58,16 --> 00:21:02,94
there was a lot of joy in coming together and working for a common cause

176
00:21:02,94 --> 00:21:10,22
and it's certainly a very positive experience i think for everyone who attended the protestant clued in probably some

177
00:21:10,22 --> 00:21:17,88
of the place and. And maybe even some of the longer this you know i think that perhaps even the end of it.

178
00:21:17,88 --> 00:21:24,18
You know there was great things going on. You know sweat lodges and. You know. Campfires and.

179
00:21:24,18 --> 00:21:29,89
Lots of music and lots of message and. You know there was a strong festival omen.

180
00:21:29,89 --> 00:21:48,54
To all of the forest protests that are saying. Very well thanks i certainly concerned about the environment.

181
00:21:48,54 --> 00:21:53,28
Is the thing that runs through all of the alternative ideas.

182
00:21:53,28 --> 00:21:57,54
And you know the idea that way by sickly part of night sure and made.

183
00:21:57,54 --> 00:22:07,78
To moderate amount to moderate out the mines on natural systems and. Live in harmony with nature is you know.

184
00:22:07,78 --> 00:22:41,08
One of the key concepts in the whole alternative movement. That's that n.c.d.c. Christian. It's becoming very.

185
00:22:41,08 --> 00:22:49,93
You know this. A reorientation of priorities the. Comes from moving from the city to the country and.

186
00:22:49,93 --> 00:22:54,41
The idea of becoming more involved in the process is that mike you are. Possible.

187
00:22:54,41 --> 00:23:00,24
I think you know it involves a fundamental shift in values.

188
00:23:00,24 --> 00:23:06,27
Having said that there are men just by coming to value natural processes and.

189
00:23:06,27 --> 00:23:10,01
Trying to become involved in the trial processes in a holistic y.

190
00:23:10,01 --> 00:23:13,78
Doesn't mean that you suddenly cut yourself off from your past and.

191
00:23:13,78 --> 00:23:19,87
People often expect that people are moved to the country necessarily stoppel the habits that they had

192
00:23:19,87 --> 00:23:22,11
when they were living in the city. And that.

193
00:23:22,11 --> 00:23:26,93
That certainly isn't the case i think so has been a dialectic and i between hope

194
00:23:26,93 --> 00:23:37,57
and despair us by as you know despair being the paradigm that it's dominant in. You know sort of poor urban lost all.

195
00:23:37,57 --> 00:23:42,07
And there's a fair bit of despair in a poor rural lost all outside suit but at least. Runs.

196
00:23:42,07 --> 00:23:46,82
You know in intimate contact with night here and the forces of life.

197
00:23:46,82 --> 00:23:55,22
So that i think i spend a lot of time between then and now. Sort of you know poised between hope and despair.

198
00:23:55,22 --> 00:23:59,82
I mean there's still a lot of strong indications that the human rights is down the tubes and.

199
00:23:59,82 --> 00:24:07,13
In the next century or two into ends of climatic disruption the greenhouse effect the eyes on the place and.

200
00:24:07,13 --> 00:24:14,96
All of those sorts of problems. If they're not addressed obviously not very favorable to the survival of s. Bases.

201
00:24:14,96 --> 00:24:23,71
And i think that it's. It's very important that alternatives to. You know the current. Consumer oriented.

202
00:24:23,71 --> 00:24:39,42
Last also put forward. And i think that's part of the real value of now and then. Well i think.

203
00:24:39,42 --> 00:24:44,11
There was a reasonable component of the fed newsom.

204
00:24:44,11 --> 00:24:50,36
Although made him much of the activity that passes for head news and actually creates a pleasure. You know.

205
00:24:50,36 --> 00:24:57,37
In in our the short medium or long to them is probably questionable. But i think a lot of.

206
00:24:57,37 --> 00:25:03,46
What some people would say is they had an ism. That's a lot. You know and.

207
00:25:03,46 --> 00:25:09,85
A lot of what passes for hidden ism is really about a skype ing from painful realities.

208
00:25:09,85 --> 00:25:20,83
And those realities if you try to skype from the intended just become more painful. Another image of chinese in nimbin.

209
00:25:20,83 --> 00:25:33,89
Since i want to set those windows so they're going to be a problem with a magic change in nimbin that i've seen since

210
00:25:33,89 --> 00:25:36,39
nine seventy three.

211
00:25:36,39 --> 00:25:42,32
And actually could you know how to fairly definite song about three four years after the festival was the arrival of

212
00:25:42,32 --> 00:25:44,94
smacking newman. You know.

213
00:25:44,94 --> 00:25:48,44
Prior to that there was virtually no straight crime you'd leave the case

214
00:25:48,44 --> 00:25:58,43
and you can have no concerns about the security behind and so on and. You know as soon as. Drugs are often in bin or.

215
00:25:58,43 --> 00:26:02,07
You know. Visibly iraq to nimbin. That all chinese to and.

216
00:26:02,07 --> 00:26:06,46
You know on a certain level applies has been going downhill since then.

217
00:26:06,46 --> 00:26:12,82
You know in terms of social amenity and so on and i think that that's probably a function of.

218
00:26:12,82 --> 00:26:16,81
Polarity between hope and despair. You know that has caused.

219
00:26:17,71 --> 00:26:18,19
Going to give

220
00:26:18,19 --> 00:26:23,83
and some of the alternative ideas that have come forward in their adoption by mindstream says saudi there's also

221
00:26:23,83 --> 00:26:30,32
considerable grounds for despair and. Individuals you know i caught between those two poles can go either way.

222
00:26:30,32 --> 00:26:35,58
And i think the name in his applies would buy i think stranger hardly visible you know where you've got some of the

223
00:26:35,58 --> 00:26:41,02
most constructive alternatives interns of. You know environmental work in terms of alternative technologies.

224
00:26:41,17 --> 00:26:50,86
You've also got a substantial number of people who live through. Bicycling concerned with. Walking themselves out and.

225
00:26:50,86 --> 00:26:54,27
Newman seems to be apply self extremes you know.

226
00:26:54,27 --> 00:26:59,74
One of the things that i used to side bet nimbin is that it was a very tolerant place in fact it was.

227
00:26:59,74 --> 00:27:09,3
The town where even intelligence was tolerated and. Yeah. It's certainly applies to. Visible extremities.

228
00:27:09,3 --> 00:27:18,89
Of a number of different spectrums.

229
00:27:18,89 --> 00:27:24,57
There was a few reasons why i left new even one was that i wanted to study at university and.

230
00:27:24,57 --> 00:27:28,25
You know get more actual skills in middle management.

231
00:27:28,25 --> 00:27:33,33
And so i was much more convenient given that the university it was in was more. To move in lismore.

232
00:27:33,33 --> 00:27:35,31
But also newman is quite a small community

233
00:27:35,31 --> 00:27:40,05
and it can be quite difficult living in a small community in terms of their very own eyes what everyone else was doing

234
00:27:40,05 --> 00:27:42,11
all the time and.

235
00:27:42,11 --> 00:27:50,14
You know you use a certain amount of anonymity is always quite good to have in your life so i think part of a larger

236
00:27:50,14 --> 00:28:02,54
community is as. As i am in lismore as is another of the reasons why i left the us.

237
00:28:02,54 --> 00:28:09,86
I think the main thing that put strains on relationships. At nimbin is the fact that there's very little work and.

238
00:28:09,86 --> 00:28:16,81
Consequently very little income inside of building a house and rising children. When you're on the dollar.

239
00:28:17,18 --> 00:28:20,81
It is basically extremely difficult and.

240
00:28:20,81 --> 00:28:26,06
You know you might tell your allies and ships in those extremely difficult economic circumstances.

241
00:28:26,06 --> 00:28:32,53
Is is not an easy task. So that.

242
00:28:32,53 --> 00:28:36,74
While i was running the trade planning business i was probably earning less than it would have been getting on the

243
00:28:36,74 --> 00:28:43,4
dollar. So you know just. That many years of. Of that level of poverty.

244
00:28:43,4 --> 00:29:03,72
I think that places great strides on relationships and so they do it online. No nothing i've written him in story.

245
00:29:03,72 --> 00:29:16,03
Of cup with i've written him and nine. Sin bin and it's on family and show you coming to the places.

246
00:29:16,03 --> 00:29:22,01
And been extremely important in a strained society i do remember growing dunston signing to me once that.

247
00:29:22,72 --> 00:29:27,4
Kanaan in thirty or thirty nine the place for a young man of goodwill was in spine.

248
00:29:27,4 --> 00:29:36,42
And on in seventy three it was in still tend to believe that the truth and that. And that and.

249
00:29:36,42 --> 00:29:41,8
As a focus for alternative ideas that newman supplied a very important role in history and society.

250
00:30:00,88 --> 00:30:09,46
I think like the rest of us struggle with nim in his you know my dad significant gains in terms of the natural

251
00:30:09,46 --> 00:30:11,56
environment through.

252
00:30:11,56 --> 00:30:19,65
Reestablishing trade cover and so on but in terms of whether it's done and offered side differently. And you know.

253
00:30:19,65 --> 00:30:24,09
The newman valley is probably one of the best areas in a strategy for growing trays and.

254
00:30:24,09 --> 00:30:28,73
While the significant numbers being planted i think we need to get.

255
00:30:28,73 --> 00:30:34,17
Applied work force and commercially driven trade growing activities and.

256
00:30:34,17 --> 00:30:41,33
And we also made an acceptance across the saudi that the environmental cost of development always need to be balanced

257
00:30:41,33 --> 00:30:52,98
by environmental benefits. To counterbalance those costs.

258
00:30:52,98 --> 00:30:59,68
Well i think it's not just a challenge for new minutes the challenge for australia to realise that we are the get

259
00:30:59,68 --> 00:31:05,65
sustainable or we're on the last.

260
00:31:05,65 --> 00:31:12,14
Humans always been a magnet for fruitcakes of various kinds you know other people who just you know because their ideas

261
00:31:12,14 --> 00:31:18,35
were too progressive or too good food mindstream society of tended to guy the people whose ideas

262
00:31:18,35 --> 00:31:25,33
and behavior were unacceptable to the rest of society who tended to gather this and. You know there's been some.

263
00:31:25,33 --> 00:31:35,04
Contested. Is that have been born there has been some wondering incredibles that you wouldn't believe a pleasure.
