1
00:00:13,95 --> 00:00:23,27
And we also had the good fortune of having the support of the health and. Building surveyor. For terrain is shot.

2
00:00:23,27 --> 00:00:26,96
Through an issue i was later moved into the city of liz mill.

3
00:00:26,96 --> 00:00:33,68
But that time the help in building survey was one wily doctoring. And while he was quite fascinated with.

4
00:00:33,68 --> 00:00:41,57
What was going on in the preparation vista will bend over backwards to help us so he really made it easy for us.

5
00:00:42,2 --> 00:00:47,12
So we deliver the shah negotiations also had this sort of measure of quality.

6
00:00:47,12 --> 00:00:51,04
And for the resilience to it was really special time and.

7
00:00:51,04 --> 00:00:55,36
One of the landowners cool day smith was very helpful to us

8
00:00:55,36 --> 00:01:03,77
and dave had a property that i joined one of the sights of the festival which we leased and.

9
00:01:03,77 --> 00:01:10,18
The boundary was the creek morgan creek. And dave took to riding his horse.

10
00:01:10,18 --> 00:01:13,59
Down to the creek to inspect the boundary and see how things were developing there.

11
00:01:13,59 --> 00:01:23,37
And of course one of the mums was there was a lot of naked swimming in the creek and. David course. We ask. We can.

12
00:01:23,37 --> 00:01:24,01
You know.

13
00:01:24,01 --> 00:01:27,94
Give her a ride in the horse and he'd stand there and these naked women would take his horse up the creek

14
00:01:27,94 --> 00:01:32,62
and fight lady godiva and it was jest magically that beautiful women.

15
00:01:32,62 --> 00:01:40,21
You know in good will select and say you know it's just a good feeling.

16
00:01:40,21 --> 00:01:45,54
That was like we are many is to establish the vibe of the festival how we wanted the festival to be.

17
00:01:45,54 --> 00:01:49,73
Early on the meeting with the message we were completely taken by the mcluhan.

18
00:01:49,73 --> 00:01:59,14
Idea that we have to demonstrate in everything we did. And. And it was difficult at the same time.

19
00:01:59,14 --> 00:02:08,83
More and more people arrived in him than. Under the aegis of the festival. What we discovered was that.

20
00:02:08,83 --> 00:02:12,99
Less work was being done and the more people we were feeding in the less. It was being done the go.

21
00:02:12,99 --> 00:02:16,18
Progress on the side getting the toilets and things made was going very slowly

22
00:02:16,18 --> 00:02:21,73
and exhausting the people who were doing it. And meanwhile. There was a lot of it lying around in the street.

23
00:02:22,77 --> 00:02:29,64
So i will say this difficult job of motivating people. And. It came to a head for me.

24
00:02:29,64 --> 00:02:35,48
And it was an issue that's been that has dogged newman ever since like the role of gate keeping.

25
00:02:37,49 --> 00:02:46,54
How do you how to get people to agree on standards of behavior when everything is free. You know that and.

26
00:02:47,79 --> 00:02:54,69
It was personified for me in the arrival of a particular woman who was which. Right and i.

27
00:02:54,69 --> 00:03:01,67
I do not use this word lightly. She had been brought to town by a guy who was willing in the occult.

28
00:03:03,14 --> 00:03:07,77
And he he had a house a property ever in the coast. Byron bay way.

29
00:03:08,07 --> 00:03:12,54
And this woman is obviously too much and he just up and said well taken him another look after your name

30
00:03:12,54 --> 00:03:20,79
and so he literally drove up and pushed around the can. And lifted them. She was dressed.

31
00:03:20,79 --> 00:03:28,57
She used to wear a very short skirt. In one hand she clutched at a dirty rag doll. Much. Much handled ragdoll.

32
00:03:28,57 --> 00:03:37,42
She would have been made forty for the hard to say. Face blown up by excessive consumption of alcohol.

33
00:03:37,42 --> 00:03:44,14
And in the other hand she would clasp a bottle. And say. And.

34
00:03:44,14 --> 00:03:49,89
She was a woman of some power parent she'd been an actress and she her timing was immaculate.

35
00:03:49,89 --> 00:03:55,00
She knew what to say and how to say it in a way that really shocked people. Went to the rich.

36
00:03:55,00 --> 00:03:59,54
And it wasn't too long before she was thrown out of the newman pub.

37
00:03:59,54 --> 00:04:06,99
And the story is that to the lawyers in the newman pub. Who of course.

38
00:04:06,99 --> 00:04:13,45
Fascinated by who these women hang around i mean this is. This is the town that was. Didn't have too many young women.

39
00:04:14,25 --> 00:04:16,35
Suddenly. Indicted with single women.

40
00:04:19,37 --> 00:04:26,99
He is he they were staring at her and she's just tennis to me what you want to fuck with so.

41
00:04:26,99 --> 00:04:30,6
Confronting them with the truth. So they checked around.

42
00:04:30,6 --> 00:04:36,39
But that didn't stop her from getting alcohol so she arranged for other people to buy. Who had booze.

43
00:04:36,39 --> 00:04:43,24
And she would lie in the street with the. Dress up around the crotch. Drunk in abusing people as they were passed.

44
00:04:43,24 --> 00:04:50,17
Now for me this was a crisis. You know in our community liaison process quite apart from sitting example.

45
00:04:50,17 --> 00:04:52,17
Still expecting to be fed by the festival.

46
00:04:52,57 --> 00:04:57,23
You know to encourage people not to work and she had a whole following around. You know. If we don't have one.

47
00:04:57,86 --> 00:04:58,84
You know this.

48
00:04:58,84 --> 00:05:04,11
It's all just happening man it's all just happening in the food is just happening and you're just happening and.

49
00:05:04,11 --> 00:05:09,41
It was just him he shut up and leave us alone. So what happened.

50
00:05:09,41 --> 00:05:13,38
You know i try to nile and say well we can't feed you and she's.

51
00:05:13,38 --> 00:05:17,98
Fixed me with the beady eyes and let me know that i was the double whammy tonight.

52
00:05:17,98 --> 00:05:22,73
I was suffering from overwork at that time. We were working seven and seven day weeks and.

53
00:05:22,73 --> 00:05:30,8
You know ten hour days to this guy. We had to reinvent the. The sabbath. Give us a wrist you know it was.

54
00:05:30,8 --> 00:05:36,36
Everything was up for invention at this time we discovered the sabbath was a very good idea to take a day off every

55
00:05:36,36 --> 00:05:44,1
seven days. And i was struck and i remember being walked around the house who were standing by my friends you know.

56
00:05:44,1 --> 00:05:51,37
And i was totally obsessed want to be going to do with. This and grime it's only one small problem. You know.

57
00:05:51,37 --> 00:05:57,92
Think of all the good things that have you remember all was good but it was like ok. I just had a print of mine.

58
00:05:58,06 --> 00:06:08,95
So it was a kind of. My fix. First hexing right. And. The whole thing about the agrarian space to with that.

59
00:06:08,95 --> 00:06:14,88
From the point of view of a university student. Studying sociology we had lots of wonderful ideas.

60
00:06:14,88 --> 00:06:20,92
The practice of being on the street implementing those ideas with the now the total reality of you dealing with people

61
00:06:20,92 --> 00:06:24,79
that didn't have the ideas necessarily.

62
00:06:24,79 --> 00:06:31,19
Had lots of other wedding ideas that didn't associate of sure the university was like a privileged environment to

63
00:06:31,19 --> 00:06:34,34
develop ideas there were there were fences around i'd forgotten about the fences

64
00:06:34,34 --> 00:06:36,28
and other fences you had did so many years of school

65
00:06:36,28 --> 00:06:41,08
and pass exams all that kind of stuff before you were allowed to join the conversation. I'd forgotten about that.

66
00:06:41,08 --> 00:06:46,2
And i discovered this whole other reality world community where all kinds of people turned up

67
00:06:46,2 --> 00:06:53,37
and you had to deal with all kinds of energy. So that was my first confrontation with a pixie.

68
00:06:53,37 --> 00:06:57,65
And we managed to solve that one by going around to people asking for a you know.

69
00:06:57,65 --> 00:07:01,84
Respect was going on respect for the locals and everyone who came out about the festival.

70
00:07:01,84 --> 00:07:07,75
Development don't talk to this woman. And suggest that she not the soffits to the townspeople.

71
00:07:07,75 --> 00:07:14,23
And it worked what happened was that. She changed her name to enter jellicoe.

72
00:07:15,72 --> 00:07:21,11
And disappeared off the street she went and lived by the time we'd secured the release on the festival site

73
00:07:21,11 --> 00:07:29,29
and she went and lived on the rest of the site and ceased to be an education to the. The festival production.

74
00:07:29,29 --> 00:07:31,95
So there were the invention or the other adventurous type.

75
00:07:31,95 --> 00:07:39,31
People have tell you another story bellenger like it was that. There was a band over in coaching kogan.

76
00:07:39,31 --> 00:07:46,65
At the time and they represented. The the. The settlers who had settled in the main i'm barely. We going to maine.

77
00:07:46,65 --> 00:07:47,81
In search of the property.

78
00:07:47,81 --> 00:07:53,44
But we've been told clearly by some of the settlers they didn't want to know about any festival happening in the valley

79
00:07:53,44 --> 00:07:54,69
thank you very much.

80
00:07:54,69 --> 00:08:01,08
They are lived very quietly on they are growing they die very quietly thank you very much and didn't want to publicly.

81
00:08:01,08 --> 00:08:04,76
But nevertheless we've had a lot of supporters who liked the idea of the festival

82
00:08:04,76 --> 00:08:14,74
and cogan offered to give us a free concert. And i travel all the way from more to glamorous. The back roads.

83
00:08:14,74 --> 00:08:21,42
To give this concert. Now. There was a the debate about the quality and structure was ongoing.

84
00:08:21,42 --> 00:08:27,47
I mean how do you run this organized everything was up for grabs and we've had previous conversation about this where.

85
00:08:27,47 --> 00:08:33,89
You know there'd be no division between performer and audience. Like anyone could be a performer and.

86
00:08:35,96 --> 00:08:41,64
It happened this night that. This. This woman i spoke of before the which. Decided that she wanted to sing too.

87
00:08:41,88 --> 00:08:47,85
And when the band sort of hostile rough and said no we worked in a gig thinking. We don't need any help.

88
00:08:47,85 --> 00:08:53,14
She got up on stage and wander around a bit and people ignored her until she got one of the microphone leads

89
00:08:53,14 --> 00:09:03,5
and against drinking the drama. Stopped me. Walked off. She set down the drum. And started playing a self you know.

90
00:09:03,5 --> 00:09:09,77
Do you think your eyes and anyway. Talk about hicks like.

91
00:09:09,77 --> 00:09:12,51
They came to nimbin in three counties

92
00:09:12,51 --> 00:09:21,16
and on the way back from it they had a three calculation they ran into each other right. With this woman shit.

93
00:09:22,65 --> 00:09:29,79
And another occasion i remember using the name of the who were a great debate. Erupted about.

94
00:09:29,79 --> 00:09:35,4
Structure and about who had the right to be on stage as a performer and who hadn't and. Escorted by.

95
00:09:35,4 --> 00:09:43,74
All the audience got up and got on the stage right. Everyone is a performer no such was the dynamism.

96
00:09:43,74 --> 00:09:51,73
Yes it was just spontaneous everyone got up and. Then we tried that for a while and that didn't work so i think.

97
00:09:52,12 --> 00:10:06,57
So that's where the plates. Yes to and. Well it was mainly for the septic tank system. The public toilet.

98
00:10:07,92 --> 00:10:14,67
We made and liked a sort of a festival planning day. Called people and all the people involved in producing things.

99
00:10:14,67 --> 00:10:18,06
As many people to get there is possible to come for a meeting about the festival.

100
00:10:18,06 --> 00:10:28,43
So we had a lot of people in town and in fact it was a mini festival in itself and nimbin is one of those.

101
00:10:28,43 --> 00:10:37,55
Country towns that made a major contribution. In blood. To both wars and. One of the things i.

102
00:10:37,55 --> 00:10:40,58
When i was reading about the history of nimbin there are photographs of.

103
00:10:40,58 --> 00:10:47,81
Men from the tweed valley sitting on the wharf. You for people who don't know this there it's a river port.

104
00:10:47,81 --> 00:10:50,9
It's up to the. The northern rivers.

105
00:10:50,9 --> 00:10:56,2
And most of the towns the major towns were sort of the originally as timber towns to see the getting towns.

106
00:10:56,2 --> 00:11:03,18
And as river ports. And it was the river port for the tweed. It was like the war.

107
00:11:03,18 --> 00:11:10,31
Was really stacked with young men being sent off to the first world war and they had the feeling that this war.

108
00:11:10,31 --> 00:11:12,48
From which they exported all the butter and.

109
00:11:12,48 --> 00:11:17,87
All of the dairy produce in the team or all the produce from the the valley. Was also now.

110
00:11:18,84 --> 00:11:26,94
Exporting its manpower is young men. To go on for fighting this foreign war. And they're doing this.

111
00:11:26,94 --> 00:11:32,65
It's obvious to me from the reading because they are really proud of what they've achieved. The settlements.

112
00:11:32,65 --> 00:11:35,83
Pullet the settlement. Of that area.

113
00:11:35,83 --> 00:11:37,89
We're talking about nine hundred fourteen

114
00:11:37,89 --> 00:11:44,86
or something would have been only thirty years old at that time they'd cleared the forest. Built the.

115
00:11:44,86 --> 00:11:51,58
Establish a farm economy. And to build the towns and the homes in the churches.

116
00:11:51,58 --> 00:11:57,94
And i had a lot to be proud for that they had brought. Western civilization the best of it. To this untamed country.

117
00:11:58,28 --> 00:12:00,9
The big scrub. They can.

118
00:12:00,9 --> 00:12:07,97
It was if they'd you know rush you will and they didn't they'd created this community up here and.

119
00:12:07,97 --> 00:12:11,32
The prove that they are part of the empire. And this great future they sent these you.

120
00:12:11,72 --> 00:12:14,92
Off to war and of course the most wanted and.

121
00:12:14,92 --> 00:12:18,74
I think that's my understanding of this theory and the spirit went out of it.

122
00:12:19,55 --> 00:12:26,35
And the woman more will speak a lot about guilt. More than glory. In this area. And again the second world war.

123
00:12:26,35 --> 00:12:36,83
And the queerest. Festival. Acquired the the name been returned services. League club.

124
00:12:36,83 --> 00:12:40,78
For five hundred dollars we were really using that as the festival office and.

125
00:12:41,75 --> 00:12:45,58
When we cleaned up to move in there we discovered all the photographs of.

126
00:12:45,58 --> 00:12:51,65
You know that had been reproduced of all the men from the village that it served in the second world war as well.

127
00:12:51,65 --> 00:12:57,08
And we had those arranged on the wall. You know so we are quite conscious of. The war legacy.

128
00:12:57,08 --> 00:13:01,69
We are still something we come and claim the photographs and put them into storing and then.

129
00:13:01,69 --> 00:13:10,43
I had an inquiry a couple of years ago i lost no one knows where they are. Least we were we had them on display and.

130
00:13:10,43 --> 00:13:17,3
So that the end they parade became of special significance to the nimbin people because it represented their culture

131
00:13:17,3 --> 00:13:22,45
and what they were proud of him because it's they had so many strangers in town from the clearest this will always talk

132
00:13:22,45 --> 00:13:31,19
about the new age in creating this new culture. They put on quite a show and. We were there to witness the parade.

133
00:13:31,19 --> 00:13:37,28
And they went from the parade into the town hall for the service and sick texas and. Just at that moment.

134
00:13:37,28 --> 00:13:38,58
The septic tank.

135
00:13:38,58 --> 00:13:42,17
Which was much overloaded by all of this is the town blew up

136
00:13:42,17 --> 00:13:48,85
and roared through duran down the hill beside the two that's in the hall. Obviously side the. The hole and.

137
00:13:48,85 --> 00:13:57,47
The whole town stank of thirds that weekend. And so it was.

138
00:13:57,47 --> 00:14:11,32
With us i'm like no no no no there's a lot of respect for that. But the townspeople because they match so proudly on.

139
00:14:11,74 --> 00:14:20,38
It was certainly no heckling or anything like that. So we approached the festival. And of course.

140
00:14:20,38 --> 00:14:25,31
The closer we got to the. The more intense it became the negotiations the work.

141
00:14:25,31 --> 00:14:33,16
I'm going to post by the time we got the things. Festival johnny and i were sort of. Basket cases. Johnny along.

142
00:14:33,16 --> 00:14:37,84
Lost his voice. And johnny allen is. Has a beautiful time.

143
00:14:38,34 --> 00:14:48,42
And beautiful voice he could spin tiles and get people's agreement. He couldn't speak and. I couldn't he was.

144
00:14:48,42 --> 00:14:50,61
I was people overload people would talk to me

145
00:14:50,61 --> 00:14:54,42
and i literally could not hear what they're saying i deceive the lips moving. Nothing.

146
00:14:54,42 --> 00:15:01,49
No meaning went into the brain i was that. I just had too many. So i gotta say that.

147
00:15:03,01 --> 00:15:08,11
Rather time the festival began i was in no state to enjoy you know the except sleep.

148
00:15:08,77 --> 00:15:17,23
And julie and i had made this pact that when the festival began we would retire. As organizers.

149
00:15:17,23 --> 00:15:22,94
And that other people take care of the organization the festival and. Let me say it worked. Right.

150
00:15:22,94 --> 00:15:27,04
We just literally walked out of the office and then people arose

151
00:15:27,04 --> 00:15:31,52
and picked up the tools we had a daily newsletter so calling for volunteers.

152
00:15:31,52 --> 00:15:36,14
But one of the major two was was to keep the toilets clean and supplied with.

153
00:15:36,14 --> 00:15:43,38
Toilet paper lined out and all that kind of stuff. These were sort of holes in the ground. You need sexual toilets.

154
00:15:43,38 --> 00:15:51,15
You know like. This was a great spiritual breakthrough for some people in mixed company.

155
00:15:51,15 --> 00:15:57,4
But they're not all the total out there but there are some that were deliberately left as that kind of option. Anyway.

156
00:15:57,4 --> 00:16:04,29
Servicing the toilet and keeping them. You things clean with a major issue and. What happened was that a woman.

157
00:16:04,29 --> 00:16:13,17
Offered their services she was a labor organizer of a civil and civic. Civil construction. She. Got some. C.b. Radio.

158
00:16:13,17 --> 00:16:18,81
From the state emergency service and. Had a team of people who used to work around reporting and.

159
00:16:18,81 --> 00:16:20,63
She'd organize the supplies you would wonderful.

160
00:16:20,63 --> 00:16:24,98
She did that for about four days then she walked out of the office and someone else picked up the task.

161
00:16:25,28 --> 00:16:34,92
So that so the first of all maintenance with. Was kept on. I also we had a free press.

162
00:16:34,92 --> 00:16:41,9
We had a lithographic press that used to produce. Pamphlets out the back and people. Anyone can produce a pamphlet.

163
00:16:42,5 --> 00:16:49,92
And distributed. Bush video with their theory videoing the festival and reducing the first cable network.

164
00:16:49,92 --> 00:16:55,42
Who we got one monitor in a shop front by the end of the festival. But they put lots of interesting.

165
00:16:55,42 --> 00:17:01,64
Half inch black and white. Video was taken at the time. All when one of the phenomenal remember was that.

166
00:17:01,64 --> 00:17:09,16
I remember that one of the reasons for going to name one was to get away from the authority structures. Right now.

167
00:17:09,16 --> 00:17:17,18
I was so into living in them but by the time the festival. Because we dealing on foot of a personal place.

168
00:17:17,18 --> 00:17:23,37
Basis with the police and being totally open with us i mean we struck a deal with the. The head of the c.i. B.

169
00:17:23,37 --> 00:17:29,59
About drugs he came up to us and said. This is how old frederick slighted. The mayor of this morning he said look.

170
00:17:30,23 --> 00:17:33,93
I understand there are going to be. Drugs at this festival.

171
00:17:33,93 --> 00:17:41,04
I don't want to be embarrassed by the drugs at this festival so keep them off the streets. So that was a pact that.

172
00:17:41,24 --> 00:17:45,56
The police wouldn't go into the fields and arrest people for drugs.

173
00:17:45,56 --> 00:17:50,32
And we would make sure the drugs were in a part of the street scene.

174
00:17:50,32 --> 00:17:55,95
So i was finding the police very cooperative because we had the support of matching the local policeman.

175
00:17:55,95 --> 00:17:59,9
But as people arrive for the festival from the university. You know i left with the when the.

176
00:17:59,9 --> 00:18:06,68
The festival began in earnest and then. The trains that. We heard all these complaints from the left wing is arriving.

177
00:18:06,68 --> 00:18:11,32
Or they could see their arriving town or they could see was a policeman right. Thing.

178
00:18:11,5 --> 00:18:14,85
When we actually went down to a camp of a radical group.

179
00:18:14,85 --> 00:18:18,89
And this is what they told us and we thought we had them who we thought were coming to a free zone you know.

180
00:18:18,89 --> 00:18:26,29
And we will be sleaze police everywhere. Thing. Police or even ball. And it was completely different vision. You know.

181
00:18:28,34 --> 00:18:35,17
Thing being part of the community. Some are one of the last to say about memories of the festival.

182
00:18:35,76 --> 00:18:45,97
Apart from exhaustion. Yeah. And this this this issue of authority. Arose yes.

183
00:18:45,97 --> 00:18:58,52
There was an interest in the situation was that the police had gone to sleep without telling us. And arrested.

184
00:18:59,61 --> 00:19:03,98
Here when you said. It was a smack case. This kind of perfect.

185
00:19:03,98 --> 00:19:12,63
I wouldn't believe that smack would come to the festival but. It's makers everywhere. And. And as a ring.

186
00:19:12,63 --> 00:19:18,98
The wrist the through. Through the festival.

187
00:19:18,98 --> 00:19:21,87
They passed all coming up the road and it was only about twenty paces

188
00:19:21,87 --> 00:19:26,79
or fifty from the most fifty meters from a sound stage.

189
00:19:26,79 --> 00:19:31,05
And people just rendered the sense that agency that's a police bust. You know.

190
00:19:31,41 --> 00:19:38,58
And the festival was so together as a community like people just rose as one and ran to the place the petty wakin

191
00:19:38,58 --> 00:19:52,56
and liberated. The. The prisoner and. In the in the melee. A policeman's gun was still on. And this of course.

192
00:19:52,56 --> 00:19:58,24
He to ruin the. We had the situation of. The media not knowing what this festival was about.

193
00:19:58,24 --> 00:20:05,85
And suddenly it had a story. And it hit the afternoon dailies. In sydney. You know typical you know.

194
00:20:05,85 --> 00:20:13,00
Hippies rioting and steal gun. So there was a lot of song. So it's seen that happen.

195
00:20:13,42 --> 00:20:17,11
In the face of that time there's a big meeting the next day to talk about it.

196
00:20:19,45 --> 00:20:24,83
And there were a whole group of people who wanted the you know.

197
00:20:24,83 --> 00:20:31,18
Action taken against the police they were down on the play station like on the stuff they had the interrupt office to

198
00:20:31,18 --> 00:20:40,11
fill. And there are people who are suing for peace who want the gun returned. Thing forgotten. Not the gotten that.

199
00:20:40,11 --> 00:20:46,15
They go in with the intent of the fist of which was to discover a community to step in the future.

200
00:20:46,15 --> 00:20:51,29
Rather than to slip back into. Antagonism and define the system in terms of opposition.

201
00:20:51,47 --> 00:20:55,89
Now the issue became increasingly urgent.

202
00:20:55,89 --> 00:21:02,22
Because what the police response in sydney was to send up the twenty first division which is of the tactical response

203
00:21:02,22 --> 00:21:05,75
squad that. Of the times. Leads with the policeman's policeman.

204
00:21:05,75 --> 00:21:13,1
And they were the two best people who bash policeman basically. And they arrived in town.

205
00:21:14,17 --> 00:21:18,58
With the breath we soon became aware. To bust the fist of all.

206
00:21:18,66 --> 00:21:23,16
And within sort of an hour of arriving and taking up duties in yemen.

207
00:21:23,16 --> 00:21:27,62
They were busting people in the main street people who had been sitting you know the festival.

208
00:21:27,62 --> 00:21:30,43
This magical place with all kinds of performance of having a street

209
00:21:30,43 --> 00:21:33,55
and people would sit around in the streets of in the.

210
00:21:33,55 --> 00:21:34,76
Part of the magic of the festival

211
00:21:34,76 --> 00:21:39,76
and suddenly the head of the twenty first division was saying you have no more riots in the streets

212
00:21:39,76 --> 00:21:48,19
and women than you would have in street if you sit down in the street to be a wrist watch it anyway.

213
00:21:48,19 --> 00:21:51,78
Clear to us that something worse was happening going to come.

214
00:21:52,08 --> 00:22:02,57
And so i went on the police station and demanded a meeting them. Between the. The superintendent of the police.

215
00:22:02,57 --> 00:22:07,51
The regional police and the head of the twenty first division. And the people from a witness.

216
00:22:07,51 --> 00:22:13,85
So a meeting was set for six pm that evening. As of thursday the twenty third division were in town.

217
00:22:15,02 --> 00:22:22,5
And we thought it would be clever if we had a local person. That this would be wise so we invited dave smith.

218
00:22:22,5 --> 00:22:25,32
Become the property owner i mentioned before.

219
00:22:25,32 --> 00:22:33,33
Quite apart from being an old newman family dave was also the organizer for the country party. In the area.

220
00:22:33,5 --> 00:22:41,09
So he invited. Dave to come to the meeting which took place in the play station. And we sat around and i remembered.

221
00:22:41,09 --> 00:22:51,45
Johnny alone with his mom his punch was going to be with him and. I you with. Prison and and the minister a officer.

222
00:22:51,45 --> 00:22:58,64
And dave smith talking to these two senior policeman who can only say. You have no special rights if you break the law.

223
00:22:59,32 --> 00:23:03,67
We have to act on them. But this time the gonna be written by the way.

224
00:23:04,23 --> 00:23:11,11
And we took them home getting it was like talking to because these guys weren't going to budge.

225
00:23:11,11 --> 00:23:18,76
They were going to bust the festival this was their name and. Eventually we asked.

226
00:23:18,76 --> 00:23:26,23
Di smith as dave what do you think about this. You know when we think if the police go into the fields tonight.

227
00:23:26,23 --> 00:23:30,79
With the earth. It will be my him. There are lots of kids in this crown.

228
00:23:30,79 --> 00:23:38,1
And you'll have stampedes and people like this. And they smith. Reply was a classic. He said. I think.

229
00:23:38,1 --> 00:23:47,04
If you go into the crowds tonight if you go into the theater which will be property damage. And it just went. Klunk.

230
00:23:47,04 --> 00:23:52,26
Right. Both policemen realize that if they did what they were planning to do.

231
00:23:52,26 --> 00:23:58,4
They would have some local fine my saying. We told them not to on television. And so they went.

232
00:23:59,83 --> 00:24:07,32
And said ok we'll review the situation tomorrow. So we stepped outside of this meeting and.

233
00:24:07,32 --> 00:24:14,12
In the yeah out of the police. Splay station this by this time it was doc. Or at least sixty uniformed police.

234
00:24:14,12 --> 00:24:18,18
Waiting for their instructions right. I had rusted people on from all around the place.

235
00:24:18,18 --> 00:24:29,17
This mighty task force that was going to do over this deal and it was averted. Not only didn't they raid the.

236
00:24:29,17 --> 00:24:36,61
The festival. Going to thier woods and risk people that night. They became the twenty first division. Sort of.

237
00:24:36,61 --> 00:24:43,54
Kind of melted. As an aggressive force and they became part of the festival. And they were challenged and.

238
00:24:43,54 --> 00:24:46,63
There was a sports day on the last saturday of the festival.

239
00:24:46,63 --> 00:24:51,04
And they were challenged to be part of the tiger woods team. Right. Against the hippies.

240
00:24:51,04 --> 00:24:56,26
Twenty first division versus the hippies. Now like they. They didn't except in the end.

241
00:24:56,26 --> 00:24:58,9
However they accepted in good faith and.

242
00:24:58,9 --> 00:25:05,47
And people talked in the streets and they were just another aspect of the fist of all. And talking with police.

243
00:25:05,47 --> 00:25:13,29
After the fist of all there was that the party. Was i guess size. A party organized by the police themselves.

244
00:25:13,29 --> 00:25:14,45
I think is that they are same club

245
00:25:14,45 --> 00:25:19,64
and to say that it was by stick with the people who worked on the on the christmas day were getting together.

246
00:25:19,64 --> 00:25:25,61
To have a drink before they split up and. Some of the people who worked on the festival.

247
00:25:25,61 --> 00:25:26,36
When they heard about it

248
00:25:26,36 --> 00:25:31,27
and went over there so they could be part of the troubadour guys who'd stablished good report with the place

249
00:25:31,27 --> 00:25:38,66
and the time they're living in in the moon and played songs to them all this kind of stuff and. In the course of this.

250
00:25:38,66 --> 00:25:52,46
They reported back to us that. What the police had this i would buy it were my best..

251
00:25:43,04 --> 00:25:50,85
Right and the thing that amazed the most was the number of police by us. He said. There were people from the f.b.i.

252
00:25:52,46 --> 00:25:57,08
People from the special school or people from. And they would come to the police station right.

253
00:25:57,08 --> 00:26:00,26
To identify themselves to us because they had information

254
00:26:00,26 --> 00:26:11,32
and had to be the most wacky weirdest dressed people you ever saw than the hippies for a.

255
00:26:11,86 --> 00:26:23,49
For the last i don't know the police will ever tell that story. Well after the. After the fist of all.

256
00:26:23,49 --> 00:26:28,74
The university students went back that. I mean. The bulk of the festival with my up of university students.

257
00:26:28,74 --> 00:26:33,87
So they went back to do the courses. And back at university. These debates.

258
00:26:33,87 --> 00:26:38,64
Arose these meetings were held on the campuses certainly at sydney university and university of new south wales.

259
00:26:38,64 --> 00:26:40,71
After name and what. Right.

260
00:26:40,71 --> 00:26:46,69
Because people had had such a profoundly moving time that they've been touched in so many ways in mind

261
00:26:46,69 --> 00:26:53,57
and been open to so many possibilities that they're. Seriously examining their university career as they courses.

262
00:26:53,57 --> 00:26:56,23
While my studying this is not relevant to the future

263
00:26:56,23 --> 00:27:01,97
and the career what i'm going to do with himself a lot of people contemplating dropping out and the like.

264
00:27:01,97 --> 00:27:09,17
So the university student went back a lot and did. Personal searches.

265
00:27:09,17 --> 00:27:14,7
Other people who are high energy people who contributed to the festival also with town. This is the.

266
00:27:14,7 --> 00:27:21,39
Phenomenon that the. People with these of an energy. The do is of the world. Usually have projects on the boil.

267
00:27:21,39 --> 00:27:27,87
So they didn't hang around after the festival which lift.

268
00:27:27,87 --> 00:27:34,78
Liftin women the flotsam and jetsam that the people who drifted into town. And.

269
00:27:34,78 --> 00:27:40,6
Were looking for a place looking for someone to look after them looking for a structure to live in now that the tunnel

270
00:27:40,6 --> 00:27:46,32
for cooperative had been launched by that time so there was a bit of an infrastructure coming together.

271
00:27:46,32 --> 00:27:51,3
Encouraging people to hang around for two hundred dollars were going to buy this land which is thirty kilometers out of

272
00:27:51,3 --> 00:27:57,07
town. But that took a long time to come when. Online it was something like six months so.

273
00:27:57,07 --> 00:28:02,55
There was a kind of a disparate. Period that followed after the festival with lots of people hanging on.

274
00:28:02,55 --> 00:28:05,57
I also had the job of doing sort of the clean up of the sot.

275
00:28:05,57 --> 00:28:11,32
Because i was responsible for most of the borrowing and of negotiations to get the sites. And i had the.

276
00:28:11,85 --> 00:28:20,67
Terrible job because people have built. Lots of. Shanties right. They built the maddest.

277
00:28:20,67 --> 00:28:28,42
Sticks and twigs and bits of plastic and all this kind of stuff. Some of them quite substantial. Wood and.

278
00:28:28,42 --> 00:28:30,6
There's a call from the tunnel people that we should.

279
00:28:30,6 --> 00:28:36,46
Recycle as much of the timber and useful materials as possible so we were dismantling things.

280
00:28:36,46 --> 00:28:39,71
But as we went in there to help again anyway

281
00:28:39,71 --> 00:28:45,58
but what happened was i go to a shanty one of the shoulders of being built in.

282
00:28:45,58 --> 00:28:52,08
And to be someone living in it and say look if it was over. Go to leave the site we're returning aside and.

283
00:28:54,29 --> 00:29:00,36
I've got to pull this thing down myself. Don't put it on the day it would stay overnight. And leave town tomorrow.

284
00:29:00,36 --> 00:29:04,11
So please leave it. As i can. And i get back the next day and.

285
00:29:04,11 --> 00:29:09,64
If someone different in a lot of people live but someone different and moved in and i had exactly the same story.

286
00:29:09,64 --> 00:29:12,34
I was going to totally frustrated with the track.

287
00:29:12,34 --> 00:29:16,51
Because these were mushroom made as basically these are people hanging around.

288
00:29:16,51 --> 00:29:21,91
Having mushroom trips which i'm quite into a mess from trip with self like i was there with a runabout.

289
00:29:21,91 --> 00:29:28,14
But they were certainly not helping with the cleanup and. It was a disc coming down to a few of us.

290
00:29:28,14 --> 00:29:32,15
Doing the dirty work. And i was getting more and i was exhausted again.

291
00:29:32,15 --> 00:29:35,55
And i had really bad side pains i was getting very short.

292
00:29:36,07 --> 00:29:42,44
And by the end of the wake of walking around with a big stick. And a box of matches. And if i found a shoulder empty.

293
00:29:42,44 --> 00:29:47,7
I would move the positions out and set fire to it.

294
00:29:47,7 --> 00:29:52,58
And if you want approached me complaining i would wave my stick and say the festival is over.

295
00:29:52,58 --> 00:30:04,51
So so much for peace and love. So it was a very difficult job. Just that. The whole pendulum of energy. Shifted.

296
00:30:04,51 --> 00:30:11,32
After the festival. So all the good energy. Went off. To do something. And all the people who were hanging around.

297
00:30:11,49 --> 00:30:17,87
Writing things to be done for them. Remained on. Not all of them. I mean. But a substantial number.

298
00:30:18,88 --> 00:30:23,91
I remember for example before i closed up the office. Of one of the guys coming.

299
00:30:25,64 --> 00:30:35,54
And when we come out aquarius buy me a toothbrush. Career is this just lost a lot of money on this festival.

300
00:30:35,84 --> 00:30:38,67
I think we lost something like twenty thousand dollars or something and.
