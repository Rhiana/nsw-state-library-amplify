1
00:00:12,72 --> 00:00:39,45
Well for. G m b. In double the bomb. To sit on a double s. Double to. Well our first time here. More names bob.

2
00:00:39,45 --> 00:00:49,1
To sit and. Our first kind then been about six weeks before the aquarius festival. With two close friends.

3
00:00:49,1 --> 00:00:54,4
And we were coming up. To help get the sart organized.

4
00:00:54,4 --> 00:01:01,51
And we were driven by the idea that the incredible string band were going to be plying which they never did.

5
00:01:01,51 --> 00:01:03,37
For the six weeks proud of the first of all.

6
00:01:03,37 --> 00:01:12,2
My mind job was working in the cafe which was cooking breakfast lunch and dinner for the workers. If you're a worker.

7
00:01:12,2 --> 00:01:18,06
Putting together the sot you're paid. One nym back and one nym back.

8
00:01:18,06 --> 00:01:22,41
Was enough to boil your breakfast lunch and dinner.

9
00:01:22,41 --> 00:01:29,7
Which usually consisted of porridge for breakfast and fried vegetables for than a lot of veggies

10
00:01:29,7 --> 00:01:38,48
and rice is a very macrobiotic time. At the same time or unfortunately.

11
00:01:38,48 --> 00:01:43,14
He was apprehended for the cultivation of marijuana.

12
00:01:43,14 --> 00:01:49,51
Which resulted in all the other people who were working on the festival so at putting on a benefit concert.

13
00:01:49,51 --> 00:01:55,44
To try to rise the biles of our to get out of this we had to spend the week in the is more lockout waiting for the

14
00:01:55,44 --> 00:01:59,46
night just right because i only had one daya week.

15
00:01:59,55 --> 00:02:04,76
And we got busted on a sign di that i had caught so we had a white tool following week to get to see him.

16
00:02:04,76 --> 00:02:15,02
And we had a wonderful benefit dance. When my money but if we had a wonderful time on. Yes. So after that.

17
00:02:15,02 --> 00:02:22,73
I went to sydney for a few months following that. To earn the money to cover the buy a little friend.

18
00:02:22,73 --> 00:02:34,08
And then came back up and rented another. Farmhouse over on stone issued road. Where i lived for six months. With.

19
00:02:34,08 --> 00:02:42,36
Maybe six other people in the big old house. At that time. Nimbin jihad jane.

20
00:02:42,36 --> 00:02:49,05
Purchased by the original group of people who got it together. And there was still.

21
00:02:49,05 --> 00:02:58,99
Shares for syle so i promptly went back off to sydney to work to earn enough money to.

22
00:02:58,99 --> 00:03:14,12
Which i did and arrived back up here. In my nineteen seventy seven. My memories of the first of all.

23
00:03:14,12 --> 00:03:21,58
I think my strongest memory of the festival was the visual impression of it. When you look.

24
00:03:21,58 --> 00:03:33,26
From the main street of newman. Down into the paddocks that are behind the hotel and it looked like me.

25
00:03:33,26 --> 00:03:40,75
Camped out for the not in some media evil. Battle there were hundreds of little camp followers everywhere.

26
00:03:40,75 --> 00:03:46,17
There was missed. It was in the middle of winter. Heavy mist.

27
00:03:46,17 --> 00:03:50,41
So you could just see these glow of the force of the smoke in the mist camborne so that you.

28
00:03:50,41 --> 00:03:53,69
When you're actually in the solitary in the camping area. Of an evening.

29
00:03:54,09 --> 00:03:58,85
You couldn't say more than fifteen twenty feet in front of you.

30
00:03:58,85 --> 00:04:05,32
Which was really rather exciting when you're walking around you sort of bump into all these rather interesting and.

31
00:04:05,32 --> 00:04:17,02
Amazing people are remember the. The public access star age. In particular to in terms of.

32
00:04:17,02 --> 00:04:18,45
If you want to get on stage

33
00:04:18,45 --> 00:04:24,57
and do something in front of a whole lot of other people you just had to write your name down on eye on the sheer jewel.

34
00:04:24,57 --> 00:04:38,03
On a blank spot and. There was lots of other people in the city as well. A lot of rhythm. A lot of drumming. People.

35
00:04:38,03 --> 00:04:44,08
Of bongos and logs and anything you could shake from it still goes on to die i was in town

36
00:04:44,08 --> 00:04:52,97
and the us that are in the african dance group had the whole of just ramping with this constant rhythm it was wonderful.

37
00:04:52,97 --> 00:04:57,93
A lot of religious groups. At the first of all i mean the christians were perhaps the most visible.

38
00:04:57,93 --> 00:05:07,21
I had a really large market. But there were maybe half a dozen different religious organizations set up the tent city.

39
00:05:07,21 --> 00:05:21,36
Cloyd the spiritual tried. The hari tent. Well. There was a free feast every lunch time. If you were hungry.

40
00:05:21,36 --> 00:05:27,37
Very much into their watts. Sugar sweets lots of. Very sweet food on like a sugar. But anyway.

41
00:05:27,37 --> 00:05:33,92
If you were hungry you could go along they always get a meal. They had a twenty four hour chanting session.

42
00:05:33,92 --> 00:05:38,87
On buddha's birthday which was on the full moon in taurus. It was.

43
00:05:38,87 --> 00:05:46,11
Celebration of the buddha and they chanted from midnight to midnight. Without so this is always somebody working at it.

44
00:05:46,11 --> 00:05:51,97
And a lot of people during that twenty first would go and join in and chant perhaps an hour.

45
00:05:51,97 --> 00:05:59,54
We'll conserve into a frenzy. Get hungry and mostly off somewhere else. I think for a lot of people through the.

46
00:05:59,54 --> 00:06:03,62
One of the great things i had to come to grips with was a toilet situation.

47
00:06:03,62 --> 00:06:15,67
Which was a circle of perhaps four four foot high. They had a whole circle inside of it. Of dani's.

48
00:06:15,67 --> 00:06:19,08
And when you went in you said madonna you were fighting perhaps seven

49
00:06:19,08 --> 00:06:22,36
or right other people who were also sitting on their. Dunnies.

50
00:06:22,36 --> 00:06:23,15
I think it's small

51
00:06:23,15 --> 00:06:28,93
and you can chat with a little petition between your downing the next danny was quite a social plies the role of

52
00:06:28,93 --> 00:06:30,97
danny's.

53
00:06:30,97 --> 00:06:36,02
Not quite as social as a sourness of course which were very social very social

54
00:06:36,02 --> 00:06:42,2
and there was too soon as there was one that was built out of corrugated on and.

55
00:06:42,2 --> 00:06:47,22
People got burned bums in that one because it used to get really crowded

56
00:06:47,22 --> 00:06:53,68
and i just what it is pack in there with all these sweaty nike ad bodies everywhere.

57
00:06:53,68 --> 00:06:56,13
And the other one was built over a creek.

58
00:06:56,13 --> 00:07:05,58
And you could jump through a hole in the floor into the creek when your heart in a lot of street activity.

59
00:07:05,58 --> 00:07:13,52
All the time. A lot of the shops at that time in women were. Unused. Just empty shops.

60
00:07:13,52 --> 00:07:20,23
But during the festival all these people came out of the woodwork and set up things like a banana fruit

61
00:07:20,23 --> 00:07:29,34
or shops in just empty shop fronts and things are for a lot of street theater. Especially in the evening.

62
00:07:29,34 --> 00:07:35,6
Mostly things are street theater happening. And then of course there was the great drama of the bust.

63
00:07:35,6 --> 00:07:44,33
When the police arrested somebody. Couple people i think that was down in the. Camping area.

64
00:07:44,33 --> 00:07:49,69
Supposedly for one position. But by the time they got them from the camps or.

65
00:07:49,69 --> 00:07:54,44
Up to the street with a paddy wagon was there must have been at least three hundred people had surrounded the paddy

66
00:07:54,44 --> 00:08:04,14
wagon. The handcuffs were actually cut off with bolt cutters and the goa sky and a policeman had his gun stolen.

67
00:08:06,43 --> 00:08:14,64
Now the result of the gun being stolen was that the next morning there would have been perhaps fifty. Down all.

68
00:08:14,64 --> 00:08:19,81
Very heavy very serious and want to know where the gun was and.

69
00:08:19,81 --> 00:08:23,86
Apparently it was returned i don't know who turned it over who'd even taken it but it was.

70
00:08:23,86 --> 00:08:30,85
It was returned and even the escapade he returned as well. With a lawyer boy saw it and everything.

71
00:08:30,85 --> 00:08:46,03
Come down considerably after that. What else was. All i was actually living. About ten kilometers. Out of town.

72
00:08:46,03 --> 00:08:53,9
At the time was to travel in early every morning light up. Open up the kitchen and get the. Porridge hot.

73
00:08:53,9 --> 00:09:07,19
Things like to get the porridge out renting a farmhouse. Far dollars a week. I think or pine and.

74
00:09:07,19 --> 00:09:15,29
When we arrived we had about eighty dollars to and i'm so we immediately. Spent fifty on advance rent.

75
00:09:15,29 --> 00:09:31,09
This and make sure that we wouldn't run out of that it was just to get. Sorry. What brought me to the festival.

76
00:09:31,09 --> 00:09:42,43
Was i desire to get out into the country. It had been. I suppose part of the alternative thoughts.

77
00:09:42,43 --> 00:09:47,97
At that time that the end result was to leave the city to get back to ny to go to the country to grow your own

78
00:09:47,97 --> 00:09:53,11
vegetables to build your own house. Just to do it you know.

79
00:09:53,11 --> 00:10:00,31
And i had tried once before very briefly in kangaroo valley and that had been a complete failure.

80
00:10:00,31 --> 00:10:05,6
Scuttled back to sydney. After only a few weeks of there. Wondering how i'd cope with leeches in the future.

81
00:10:07,86 --> 00:10:11,93
And this was just. This was.

82
00:10:12,35 --> 00:10:16,79
It was just to be in the area i'd lived at mullumbimby for a wall

83
00:10:16,79 --> 00:10:22,07
and there's a lot of people coming out in him than i'm a kind of an imminent. Lot of talk of.

84
00:10:22,07 --> 00:10:29,59
Let's settle here and things like that which is pretty much what i did eventually.

85
00:10:29,59 --> 00:10:30,96
Yes i think that will mean that it was.

86
00:10:30,96 --> 00:10:37,48
It was just to be at the gathering of the clans it felt like all of your brothers and sisters were coming along and.

87
00:10:37,48 --> 00:11:02,12
That was where you should be nimby n.g.'s well. I don't know what name binjie means i'm sorry in the earth spirit.

88
00:11:02,12 --> 00:11:12,9
I don't know off the word name down. And the name being i've heard a lot of the cars and. Explanations for the nine.

89
00:11:12,9 --> 00:11:23,83
At the time of the festival. The providing thought was that a name than was like an aboriginal. Wise man a holy man.

90
00:11:23,83 --> 00:11:32,47
And it's a spirit. Or sorts as well. Apparently the area wasn't was never actually lived in.

91
00:11:32,47 --> 00:11:45,28
Bar the reason i came here for the the men and the boys came here for and purposes or for religious ceremonies.

92
00:11:45,28 --> 00:11:49,39
And then they went back to wherever i lived i think they probably live close to the coast where there was more fishing.

93
00:11:49,39 --> 00:11:59,56
Because that the bundjalung people who were the productive dominant drive of the area were very much into their fishing.

94
00:11:59,56 --> 00:12:08,1
Coastal by strong. I mean they started at the bundjalung when the. All grandmother and her sons.

95
00:12:08,1 --> 00:12:13,97
Arrived at the beach at. Evans head there and. I think grandmother.

96
00:12:13,97 --> 00:12:16,73
One of her sons fell asleep in the eye and the other ones.

97
00:12:16,73 --> 00:12:22,39
Went off looking for food somewhere else and dawud and i camped there on the hill. At evan's hidden started off.

98
00:12:26,28 --> 00:12:29,7
So what exactly it means i'm not sure.

99
00:12:29,7 --> 00:12:36,62
Except that it probably has a lot to do with with something reasonably cycloid to every ginny's the nine itself an

100
00:12:36,62 --> 00:12:49,44
injury was spilt like that. I suspect. Just to give people a lot of trouble in zion. The property. Was bored.

101
00:12:49,44 --> 00:12:56,12
Probably about six months after the festival probably took that long to get enough people together with enough finance.

102
00:12:56,12 --> 00:13:01,58
To purchase it i think it was found before that there was quite a land depression and probably it was a silent

103
00:13:01,58 --> 00:13:09,54
and a to mine for syle. For quite some time.

104
00:13:09,54 --> 00:13:14,49
The ardea of this particular property and borrowing it and getting a community.

105
00:13:14,49 --> 00:13:23,62
Happening here it was the brainchild of mangal braugher and joyce and the woman who was luminous through line.

106
00:13:23,62 --> 00:13:29,05
And brian. Came out looked at the price. Took one look at and said yes this is the place for me.

107
00:13:29,05 --> 00:13:38,35
And gathered together as many friends and friends of friends and. It was bought. I wasn't one of the original.

108
00:13:38,35 --> 00:13:48,8
Forty six people i came in probably at number four you know on. Thing. When a couple of other people had sold out and.

109
00:13:51,06 --> 00:13:53,51
Well it's hard as i'll.

110
00:13:53,51 --> 00:13:58,33
Braun's are those i've done i've drawn dollar deals coincided with everybody else others i probably didn't because he's

111
00:13:58,33 --> 00:14:17,46
gone. But his concept was a community of people that live together very closely. A lot of. Close. Intense.

112
00:14:17,46 --> 00:14:23,59
Into personal reactions very much the encounter group thought situation you know. You're feeling she to use i.

113
00:14:23,59 --> 00:14:32,66
You give me the shits that i just why you're looking. Whatever. It's not for wall be very difficult why to leave.

114
00:14:32,66 --> 00:14:37,14
Permanently and i think he felt that that was our deals have been sacrificed.

115
00:14:37,14 --> 00:14:45,47
To other more pressing things like shelter. And water and the people was spreading people building houses.

116
00:14:45,47 --> 00:14:51,33
Separated a wife from the community hassen. Went being seen the dies at a time and things like that.

117
00:14:51,33 --> 00:14:54,92
He never bothered with the house he just moved into the old the area that was here.

118
00:14:54,92 --> 00:15:02,81
And lived there and wasn't interested in anything agricultural law. Or other wars.

119
00:15:02,81 --> 00:15:17,27
He was definitely a people person and. He went back to the city and. Started a circus.

120
00:15:17,27 --> 00:15:29,16
In terms of water in what i read. Originally were sharing everything. Originally. All food was bought.

121
00:15:29,16 --> 00:15:38,08
Just as a big bulk shop. The a community house there was a large pantries now the office. Funny how things change.

122
00:15:38,08 --> 00:15:44,29
Where the falling cabinet is now there used to be big. Bins full of grinds and.

123
00:15:44,29 --> 00:15:53,51
There was an attitude then of trying to be agricultural self-sufficient. That's never really have enjoyed it.

124
00:15:53,51 --> 00:15:55,8
The soils not growing.

125
00:15:55,8 --> 00:16:02,94
And the people who were coming live here weren't really destined to be farmers advancing with one of them a very people

126
00:16:02,94 --> 00:16:04,58
oriented as will.

127
00:16:04,58 --> 00:16:10,07
Because social interactions always been a very large part of this community aspect of most communities too

128
00:16:10,07 --> 00:16:17,56
when you're living in sharing a lot of the. Bill these are people. It industry them and talk to them. Whatever.

129
00:16:17,56 --> 00:16:39,79
For them. It's been a very very sort of organic process. Once again primarily to do with.

130
00:16:39,79 --> 00:16:49,83
Who was here at any given time and. The top of person they were with a dominant top or personality who had very strong.

131
00:16:49,83 --> 00:16:54,21
Or ideas and attitudes and they want to do particular things. Mother divided you know.

132
00:16:54,21 --> 00:16:57,42
I think if you've got people that are very motivated to do a particular thing

133
00:16:57,42 --> 00:17:02,43
and can express their ideas well then the other people who perhaps on some out of out of can think well that's the

134
00:17:02,43 --> 00:17:13,15
that's a good way to go to strike that mine and mine only one of the big things is everyone. Building houses.

135
00:17:13,15 --> 00:17:19,86
Obviously getting. Individual shelter. Situation especially as more and more people start having families and.

136
00:17:19,86 --> 00:17:28,52
When the people first bought the property. There was no children involved. One of the shareholders was pregnant and.

137
00:17:28,52 --> 00:17:35,26
She had her child he wanted probably up in the community. And since then there's been i think.

138
00:17:35,26 --> 00:17:44,59
Fifteen children born in the probably year as people tended to have families perhaps.

139
00:17:44,59 --> 00:17:55,26
Break up into more traditional nuclear family situations like built himself. Nuclear family storehouses.

140
00:17:55,26 --> 00:18:03,21
In various spots around the property there's no one as yet has actually sort of built a group. Top of living situation.

141
00:18:03,21 --> 00:18:04,26
I've gotten a number of.

142
00:18:04,26 --> 00:18:11,93
For example single people building a place together and and sharing in our person want to see more of that. But.

143
00:18:13,61 --> 00:18:41,14
Well i haven't got the war from the two children. Everything. According to the statistics. One dog. Yes.

144
00:18:41,14 --> 00:18:48,9
It has it has because it has been a bush experience of the nuclear family but not totally.

145
00:18:48,9 --> 00:18:55,9
Has it been a bush experience of the nuclear family in some respects yes it has. I mean i've got a house.

146
00:18:55,9 --> 00:19:04,25
And we've got a vegie garden next to the house. But there's a large community.

147
00:19:04,25 --> 00:19:06,9
Vegetable garden happening as well that a lot of the.

148
00:19:06,9 --> 00:19:16,18
Single people who are here what has been a bit of a population shift. Of light. A number of the.

149
00:19:16,18 --> 00:19:18,62
All the people have all the shareholders.

150
00:19:18,62 --> 00:19:23,97
But with more regional shareholders perhaps only regional shareholder rather than all that will put me down.

151
00:19:23,97 --> 00:19:34,92
I just like that. Have moved to lose more education actually had a lot to do with that. There's no final.

152
00:19:34,92 --> 00:19:41,47
He is living on twelve in that the nearest hospitals if you've got children that are going on to year eleven

153
00:19:41,47 --> 00:19:47,46
and twelve is in lismore it's obviously a damn sight easier to go to hospital is more he living in his mother rather

154
00:19:47,46 --> 00:19:56,76
than travel. Sixty or seventy eight. On a bus. So that's been a factor.

155
00:19:56,76 --> 00:20:03,94
I consider other factors too just wishing for more. Critique on foot perhaps or.

156
00:20:03,94 --> 00:20:14,38
Wanting to have a job that requires you doing. Working in lismore or. Every day.

157
00:20:14,38 --> 00:20:20,33
Is not the most convenient place to travel to and from on a regular basis at hand and they can be done.

158
00:20:20,33 --> 00:20:27,59
Just a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle. The nuclear family. In the bush.

159
00:20:27,59 --> 00:20:32,71
This still a lot of facilities a shared for example.

160
00:20:32,71 --> 00:20:43,16
Most people still do all the washing in the community laundry a couple of pumping systems that provide water to the

161
00:20:43,16 --> 00:20:44,49
whole community.

162
00:20:44,49 --> 00:20:44,67
And

163
00:20:44,67 --> 00:20:50,39
when you know that for example if the pump breaks down even though all martin be the one is using that particular pump

164
00:20:50,39 --> 00:20:56,94
i'm up at one of the guys down fixes and more problems i always fixing the problem.

165
00:20:56,94 --> 00:21:06,81
But i do fix the family and i get all the washing machines and things like that. So. And then in terms of.

166
00:21:06,81 --> 00:21:12,04
The the normal. For example. Bills and debts that.

167
00:21:12,04 --> 00:21:20,84
A nuclear family living alone in on their own piece of land would incur that's that something that i haven't had to

168
00:21:20,84 --> 00:21:30,06
live with for example you know the rights and. Land texas for example. All that sort of stuff. That's part of just.

169
00:21:30,06 --> 00:21:39,67
Everyone pays a certain amount to the cooperative. Every year and that covers all laws. Talks of bills.

170
00:21:39,67 --> 00:21:43,6
Sharing certain things yes and having your own.

171
00:21:43,6 --> 00:21:52,76
As will definitely be in financial benefit i mean i couldn't have been unemployed for a good many.

172
00:21:52,76 --> 00:21:59,9
And i certainly couldn't of a career out of this law for almost from a self.

173
00:21:59,9 --> 00:22:19,06
Unless i could have shared with other people. I suppose it was never a stated goal. Originally.

174
00:22:19,06 --> 00:22:26,18
But i suppose everybody. Would have lot of would have had that. That concept did. To to be able to somehow be.

175
00:22:26,18 --> 00:22:31,34
Become economically independent. And live this lifestyle.

176
00:22:31,34 --> 00:22:51,37
Is just phoning the whys of doing it you know while still looking as a.

177
00:22:51,37 --> 00:22:57,4
Not really not in this particular community i mean other communities by that i think have perhaps more of a group

178
00:22:57,4 --> 00:23:09,4
consciousness towards. Finance rising and. Economic viability perhaps in us. It's women communities a.

179
00:23:09,4 --> 00:23:17,55
Really just a product of the sum total of the people who happen to have them and specially with.

180
00:23:17,55 --> 00:23:22,27
Not so much tunnel because it's a lie. And it drew from such a large.

181
00:23:22,27 --> 00:23:30,26
Sort of data bias will put some bias when it originally set up it's got. Factions of all stripes sauces and colors.

182
00:23:30,26 --> 00:23:40,59
But a number of the other all the communities. Probably was started. Primarily from a group of known friends.

183
00:23:40,59 --> 00:23:44,69
And known friends are usually people with similar ideas and attitudes

184
00:23:44,69 --> 00:23:52,39
and aspirations to usually get within certain boundaries of us and as a very middle class community.

185
00:23:52,39 --> 00:23:58,83
With a lot of people coming from. Generally middle class. Taught backgrounds and. Probably lots of us holding.

186
00:23:58,83 --> 00:24:05,65
Lots of middle class as an idea is the end of the day.

187
00:24:05,65 --> 00:24:11,93
I mean i know the community i've been back as wildly almost every shareholder's a schoolteacher and.

188
00:24:12,29 --> 00:24:25,31
They're very educationally involved. Fantastic fantastic. I can't think of a bit applies.

189
00:24:25,31 --> 00:24:37,17
In terms of some way to bring up one's children. I really can't think of i better place in terms of having.

190
00:24:37,17 --> 00:24:44,01
Having an informant where your children can not come home as a sara lee from the school bus in the afternoon you won't

191
00:24:44,01 --> 00:24:45,12
see them till dark.

192
00:24:45,12 --> 00:24:51,01
And you're not in the slightest bit worried as to where they've gone that can be with somebody else on the community

193
00:24:51,01 --> 00:24:57,56
you know that offline with some friends or. Going to somebody else's place. That's. That's a lot of things as.

194
00:24:57,56 --> 00:25:06,13
Is obviously the jordan got a degree of freedom by haps and of his innocence to have a degree of freedom.

195
00:25:06,13 --> 00:25:14,22
That these guys i don't think is this possible. In the urban environment.

196
00:25:14,22 --> 00:25:22,48
They've learnt to grow up with what are considered good healthy attitudes towards the environment environmental issues

197
00:25:22,48 --> 00:25:25,59
just so much for granted.

198
00:25:25,59 --> 00:25:31,08
Because you don't rubbish things and of course you don't do this and of course you don't do that.

199
00:25:31,08 --> 00:25:40,15
Whereas it had he said we had to learn. Or take on board that they missed just the way it is. And they have got.

200
00:25:40,15 --> 00:25:47,96
I don't know. Some have said what i want to get out there and. Mike a million bucks.

201
00:25:47,96 --> 00:26:00,15
Get rich can go to they thought i was done. Mark mark jordan.

202
00:26:00,15 --> 00:26:05,23
At this stage just a little bit there and just turning to you know i just know i haven't got any for them

203
00:26:05,23 --> 00:26:11,93
and fixed attitudes as to what they'd like to really do with themselves once they finish school.

204
00:26:12,64 --> 00:26:20,53
But i've seen a number of children grow up here and leave. As what i consider a good adult in a lot.

205
00:26:20,53 --> 00:26:30,08
Interesting people. Good attitudes. Do we'll at school. We certainly haven't. Will or.

206
00:26:30,08 --> 00:26:50,28
The people who haven't tried to anyway i suppose dollar for education as well. Not the children here have gone.

207
00:26:50,28 --> 00:26:59,12
All gone to the public school back as well which is a very nice little. Country school.

208
00:26:59,12 --> 00:27:08,56
Now we need to get one hundred pupils for teachers just a very good school it's got an enormous amount of community

209
00:27:08,56 --> 00:27:19,05
input into it from the parents is perhaps the best of both rules. It's for a public education and. It's got enough.

210
00:27:19,05 --> 00:27:30,66
External input. That that. It's possible to schools have parallel input does seem to have a lot of.

211
00:27:30,66 --> 00:27:35,93
Very positive fair unlimber they have things like all cultural. Options.

212
00:27:35,93 --> 00:27:42,5
Which is when parents will come along and one day a week for maybe a month or six weeks.

213
00:27:42,5 --> 00:27:48,6
And take a small group of children in a particular. Anything. Are just.

214
00:27:48,6 --> 00:27:55,83
Bodies to the group of kids making charms out of all forks and spoons and another woman. Did filt miking.

215
00:27:55,83 --> 00:28:15,2
Just things like that and opportunities for kids to learn things like that. A fiver.

216
00:28:15,2 --> 00:28:28,04
Remember the story would be here are all part of that one.

217
00:28:28,04 --> 00:28:33,37
Ask me another question at all while i think we have to put the pause button on.

218
00:28:33,37 --> 00:28:44,05
Five min with a sense of place in the narrow our really feel proud to sign on from the menu that's where i come from.

219
00:28:44,05 --> 00:28:57,00
Years ago i saw him from back as violence between cars. But now i'm from niman just out of newman actually. It was.

220
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:04,25
It was the paypal. Thing that drew. The drew me here that all the. I was particularly attracted to just the r. D.

221
00:29:04,25 --> 00:29:07,37
Of settling in an area.

222
00:29:07,37 --> 00:29:14,03
Lots of lot want to people you know kids and kin and creating a community where you thought like.

223
00:29:14,03 --> 00:29:21,16
You weren't one of them on already. But the. But that you are one of the establishment. Even though.

224
00:29:21,16 --> 00:29:23,12
It was your own establishment.

225
00:29:23,25 --> 00:29:27,34
I think that's still what is perhaps my strongest feeling about him

226
00:29:27,34 --> 00:29:32,51
and you know especially for being a wife a little bit more drop back in didn't even for a few days

227
00:29:32,51 --> 00:29:40,37
and you drive into town is just so different from anywhere else you know anything new in the him again you there

228
00:29:40,37 --> 00:29:49,58
and there is total ad of derelicts collapsed in front of the hot bread shop that was yes i was wonderful.

229
00:29:49,58 --> 00:29:59,39
Brought up the list of use these check hadn't come in and the usual. Kloster at saw the rind.

230
00:29:59,39 --> 00:30:09,67
And just just all sorts of characters and people in really. Disreputable baggy old thoughts. Wandering along. Yeah.

231
00:30:09,67 --> 00:30:17,17
Just. Just the color. And the nonconformist. Well it's pretty conforming. With the end isn't it.

232
00:30:17,17 --> 00:30:19,52
Really are sadly like that

233
00:30:19,52 --> 00:30:25,25
when the rat pack came to town with with their shredded claw in their dreadlocks to the news of things like oh

234
00:30:25,25 --> 00:30:32,19
wonderful here. I want it visually. On a visual exhorting them and and.

235
00:30:32,19 --> 00:30:40,07
Are like a lock the whole aspect of chinese to walk the fact that there's all these things happening this is perma

236
00:30:40,07 --> 00:30:47,65
culture village already heard kicks off in him and just because it'll mean yet another group of people and more.

237
00:30:47,65 --> 00:30:51,87
In georgia and not a lot of the best but.

238
00:30:51,87 --> 00:30:59,45
I just walked out dynamics of it not being something stagnant that whole lot of all hippies went to die.

239
00:31:00,00 --> 00:31:06,05
But somewhere where a whole lot of new hippies are coming to live as well yeah.

240
00:31:06,05 --> 00:31:12,68
Like saying the young people not just hippies is people. I mean this. There's lots of.

241
00:31:12,68 --> 00:31:25,65
Lots of people that are hippies around applies to the moved in for whatever reasons. Good solid people. Yes will.

242
00:31:25,65 --> 00:31:29,81
Few challenges from them and i think the sewage one of the big challenges that.
