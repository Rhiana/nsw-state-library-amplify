1
00:00:12,56 --> 00:00:16,09
Why. Right.

2
00:00:17,74 --> 00:00:24,32
You as an m b in g double e to.

3
00:00:25,84 --> 00:00:31,50
Bob this it. T i double s o double t.

4
00:00:33,35 --> 00:00:39,15
Well i first came here. Hi my name is bob.

5
00:00:39,25 --> 00:00:39,58
Tippett

6
00:00:40,29 --> 00:00:46,56
and i first came to nimbin about six weeks
before the aquarius festival with two

7
00:00:47,39 --> 00:00:47,68
close friends

8
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:53,55
and we were coming up to
help get the site organized

9
00:00:53,55 --> 00:00:56,62
and we were driven by the idea

10
00:00:56,62 --> 00:00:59,46
that the incredible string band we're
going to be playing which they never did.

11
00:01:01,49 --> 00:01:03,04
For the six weeks prior to the festival.

12
00:01:03,07 --> 00:01:08,48
My main job was working in the rainbow
cafe which was cooking breakfast lunch

13
00:01:08,48 --> 00:01:09,55
and dinner for the workers.

14
00:01:10,60 --> 00:01:16,54
If you're a worker putting together the
site you were paid one nym buck per day

15
00:01:16,54 --> 00:01:22,05
and one number was enough to buy
you breakfast lunch and dinner.

16
00:01:22,07 --> 00:01:27,94
Which usually consisted of porridge for
breakfast and fried vegetables for dinner.

17
00:01:28,13 --> 00:01:29,66
Lots of veggies

18
00:01:29,66 --> 00:01:36,08
and rice is a very macrobiotic time.

19
00:01:36,10 --> 00:01:41,31
At the same time i unfortunately was
apprehended for the cultivation of marijuana

20
00:01:43,02 --> 00:01:48,11
which resulted in all the other people
who were working on the fence was like

21
00:01:48,11 --> 00:01:50,81
putting on a benefit concert
to try to raise the bail so

22
00:01:50,81 --> 00:01:51,78
that i could get out of jail

23
00:01:52,63 --> 00:01:55,34
that we would have to spend a week in
the lismore lock up waiting for the

24
00:01:55,34 --> 00:01:59,79
magistrate because i only had
one day a week. And we got.

25
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:00,66
After on the same day

26
00:02:00,66 --> 00:02:03,69
that they had caught so we had a wait
till following week to get to see him.

27
00:02:04,24 --> 00:02:06,69
And they had a wonderful benefit dance.

28
00:02:07,62 --> 00:02:12,23
They made no money but every
had a wonderful time. Yeah.

29
00:02:12,57 --> 00:02:16,92
So after that i are i went to
sydney for a few months following

30
00:02:16,92 --> 00:02:21,49
that to earn the money to cover
the bail but a friend a toad

31
00:02:22,66 --> 00:02:23,47
and then came back up

32
00:02:23,47 --> 00:02:29,45
and rented another farmhouse over on
stone issued road where i lived for

33
00:02:30,48 --> 00:02:32,79
i suppose six months.

34
00:02:32,81 --> 00:02:38,18
With maybe six other people
in the big old house at

35
00:02:38,19 --> 00:02:44,90
that time nimbin ji had been purchased
by the original group of people who are

36
00:02:44,90 --> 00:02:49,58
got it together and there
was still shares for sale.

37
00:02:50,56 --> 00:02:56,68
So i promptly went back off to sydney to
work to earn enough money to buy shares.

38
00:02:58,89 --> 00:02:59,31
Which i did

39
00:03:00,80 --> 00:03:08,47
and arrive back up here in my 1977.

40
00:03:11,09 --> 00:03:12,32
My memories of the festival.

41
00:03:14,06 --> 00:03:20,02
I think my strongest memory of the
festival was the visual impression of it

42
00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:24,62
when you look from the main street
of limon down into the paddocks

43
00:03:24,62 --> 00:03:28,42
that are behind the hotel.

44
00:03:28,43 --> 00:03:34,79
And it looked like an army camped
out for the night in some medieval

45
00:03:35,76 --> 00:03:39,94
battle there were hundreds of
little campfires everywhere.

46
00:03:40,06 --> 00:03:44,91
There was missed it was in the
middle of winter heavy mist.

47
00:03:46,11 --> 00:03:48,25
So you could just see
these glows of the fires

48
00:03:48,25 --> 00:03:49,99
and the smoke in the mist
combined so that you

49
00:03:49,99 --> 00:03:53,37
when you're actually in the site area
in the camping area of an evening.

50
00:03:53,58 --> 00:03:59,30
You couldn't see more than 15 20 feet
in front of you which was really rather

51
00:03:59,30 --> 00:03:59,93
exciting.

52
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,47
When you're walking around you sort of
bump into all these rather interesting

53
00:04:03,47 --> 00:04:09,72
and amazing people.

54
00:04:10,96 --> 00:04:17,65
I remember the the public access stage in
particular too in terms of if you want to

55
00:04:17,65 --> 00:04:18,12
get on stage

56
00:04:18,12 --> 00:04:21,21
and do something in front of a whole lot
of other people you just had a write your

57
00:04:21,21 --> 00:04:26,55
name down on i. On the
schedule and i'm blank spot.

58
00:04:27,38 --> 00:04:30,55
And there was lots of.

59
00:04:30,57 --> 00:04:37,19
I think of our people music as well a
lot of rhythm a lot of drumming people

60
00:04:38,19 --> 00:04:41,13
bongos and logs and
anything you could shake.

61
00:04:41,69 --> 00:04:43,91
I mean still goes on today i was in town.

62
00:04:43,98 --> 00:04:44,36
Only yesterday

63
00:04:44,36 --> 00:04:49,45
and the african dance group had the whole
of town just something with this constant

64
00:04:49,45 --> 00:04:50,11
within it was wonderful.

65
00:04:52,92 --> 00:04:56,39
A lot of religious groups at the first of
all i mean the christians were perhaps

66
00:04:56,39 --> 00:04:59,57
the most visible they had
a really large marquee.

67
00:04:59,92 --> 00:05:05,33
But there were maybe half a dozen different
religious organizations set up their

68
00:05:05,33 --> 00:05:11,15
their tents and ply
their spiritual trades.

69
00:05:11,89 --> 00:05:18,48
The hari tent. Well there was are.
A free feast every lunchtime.

70
00:05:18,67 --> 00:05:25,20
If you are hungry very much into their
whites sugar sweets lots of very sweet food

71
00:05:25,20 --> 00:05:28,35
a lot like a sugar. But anyway if
you are hungry you can go along.

72
00:05:28,37 --> 00:05:34,30
They always get a meal they are they had
a 24 hour chanting session on buddha's

73
00:05:34,30 --> 00:05:36,24
birthday which was on the
full moon in taurus.

74
00:05:36,46 --> 00:05:39,75
It was celebration of
the birthday of buddha

75
00:05:39,75 --> 00:05:44,11
and they chanted from midnight to midnight
without cease there's always somebody

76
00:05:44,12 --> 00:05:47,59
working at it and a lot of
people during that process.

77
00:05:47,85 --> 00:05:50,66
Twenty four hours ago and join
in and chance of happening.

78
00:05:50,81 --> 00:05:55,39
Our work and self into a frenzy get hungry
and most of the off somewhere else.

79
00:05:56,77 --> 00:05:59,72
I think a lot of people
see the. One of the.

80
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,57
Right things i had a come to grips with
that was a toilet situation which was.

81
00:06:04,59 --> 00:06:11,12
I circle of perhaps. 4 4 foot high.

82
00:06:12,30 --> 00:06:13,94
They had a whole circle inside of it.

83
00:06:14,03 --> 00:06:19,06
Of dunnies and when you went and you said
i dunno you are fighting perhaps seven

84
00:06:19,07 --> 00:06:22,89
or eight other people who are also sitting
on their dunnies and you could smile

85
00:06:22,89 --> 00:06:25,93
and you could chat over the little
partition between your dna in the next

86
00:06:25,93 --> 00:06:30,74
and he was quite a social
place overall the dunnies.

87
00:06:30,75 --> 00:06:34,74
Not quite a social is a soreness
of course which were very social.

88
00:06:34,88 --> 00:06:38,25
Very socially there was
too soon as there was one

89
00:06:38,25 --> 00:06:43,33
that was built out of corrugated iron and
people got burned bombs in that one.

90
00:06:45,67 --> 00:06:49,92
Because he used to get really crowded you
know just what it is pack in there with

91
00:06:49,92 --> 00:06:51,83
all these sweaty naked bodies everywhere

92
00:06:53,60 --> 00:06:55,28
and the other one was built over a creek

93
00:06:56,03 --> 00:06:58,30
and you could jump through a
hole in the floor into the creek

94
00:06:58,30 --> 00:07:01,05
when youre hot enough.

95
00:07:02,95 --> 00:07:06,23
A lot of street activity all the time.

96
00:07:07,98 --> 00:07:12,44
A lot of the shops at that time in
yemen were unused just empty shop.

97
00:07:13,44 --> 00:07:17,04
But during the first of all these
people came out of the woodwork

98
00:07:17,04 --> 00:07:23,41
and set up things like a banana fitter
shops in just empty shop fronts

99
00:07:23,41 --> 00:07:28,76
and things like a lot of street
theatre especially in the evening.

100
00:07:28,78 --> 00:07:30,74
Most evenings in the
streets here to happening

101
00:07:31,63 --> 00:07:34,59
and then of course there was
the great drama of the bust.

102
00:07:35,35 --> 00:07:40,19
When the police arrested
somebody couple people i think

103
00:07:40,19 --> 00:07:42,42
that were down in the camping area.

104
00:07:43,84 --> 00:07:45,08
Supposedly for heroin possession

105
00:07:46,78 --> 00:07:51,14
but by the time they got them from the
campsite up to the street with a paddy wagon

106
00:07:51,14 --> 00:07:56,56
was there must have been at least 300
people had surrounded the paddy wagon.

107
00:07:56,58 --> 00:07:59,41
The handcuffs were actually
cut off with bolt cutters.

108
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,47
And the guy escaped and a
policeman had his gun stolen.

109
00:08:06,38 --> 00:08:08,47
Now the result of the gun being stolen was

110
00:08:08,47 --> 00:08:14,58
that the next morning there would have
been perhaps 50 police in town all very

111
00:08:14,58 --> 00:08:18,53
heavy very serious and wanting
to know where their gun was

112
00:08:18,53 --> 00:08:21,80
and apparently it was returned
i don't know who returned it

113
00:08:21,80 --> 00:08:24,35
or who would even taken it
but it was it was returned

114
00:08:24,35 --> 00:08:28,20
and even the escapee returned as
well with a lawyer by his side

115
00:08:29,75 --> 00:08:31,42
and everything calmed down considerably.

116
00:08:31,91 --> 00:08:38,72
After that. What else.

117
00:08:39,38 --> 00:08:46,19
What else i was actually living about
10 kilometres out of town at the

118
00:08:46,19 --> 00:08:50,51
time we did travel in early every
morning i don't open up the kitchen

119
00:08:50,51 --> 00:08:53,19
and get the porridge hot

120
00:08:53,19 --> 00:08:58,36
and things like gather porridge hot. Yes.

121
00:08:58,98 --> 00:09:03,74
So we were renting a
farm house at $5 a week.

122
00:09:04,02 --> 00:09:06,77
I think we were paying and

123
00:09:06,78 --> 00:09:13,13
when we arrived we had about 80 dollars
to our name so we immediately spent 50 on

124
00:09:13,13 --> 00:09:16,63
advance rent just to make sure
that we wouldn't run out of

125
00:09:16,63 --> 00:09:22,97
that.

126
00:09:23,94 --> 00:09:27,82
No no it was a desire
to just to get sorry.

127
00:09:28,73 --> 00:09:36,61
What brought into the festival was a
desire to get out into the country.

128
00:09:36,63 --> 00:09:43,17
It had been i suppose part of the
alternative ethos at that time

129
00:09:43,17 --> 00:09:46,89
that the end result was to leave the
city to get back to nature to go to the

130
00:09:46,89 --> 00:09:49,34
country to grow your own vegetables
to build your own house.

131
00:09:51,40 --> 00:09:55,59
Just to do it you know and
i'd tried once before.

132
00:09:55,72 --> 00:09:59,87
Very briefly in kangaroo valley and that
had been a complete failure and ieds.

133
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,67
Got all back to sydney after only a few
weeks of us wondering how i'd cope with

134
00:10:04,67 --> 00:10:05,55
leeches in the future.

135
00:10:07,63 --> 00:10:11,92
And this was just this was.

136
00:10:11,94 --> 00:10:15,81
It was just to be in the area i'd
lived at mullumbimby for a while

137
00:10:16,55 --> 00:10:19,88
and there's a lot of people coming over
the nimbin and we kind of an imminent.

138
00:10:20,49 --> 00:10:24,59
Lot of talk of let's settle
here and things like

139
00:10:24,59 --> 00:10:29,84
that which is pretty much what
i did eventually yes i think

140
00:10:29,84 --> 00:10:33,52
that was i mean it was it was just to be
in at the gathering of the clans it felt

141
00:10:33,52 --> 00:10:36,99
like all your brothers and
sisters were coming along and.

142
00:10:37,00 --> 00:10:43,51
That was where you should be.

143
00:10:45,54 --> 00:10:47,54
Nimbin gee. Yes well.

144
00:10:47,56 --> 00:10:53,97
I said.

145
00:10:53,99 --> 00:11:00,36
I don't know what nimbin
gene means i'm sorry in.

146
00:11:00,38 --> 00:11:05,41
The earth's spirit. I don't
know. I mean the word nim done.

147
00:11:06,02 --> 00:11:09,00
Or nimbin i've heard a lot of.

148
00:11:10,25 --> 00:11:15,11
I suppose an explanation for the name at
the time of the festival the prevailing

149
00:11:15,11 --> 00:11:21,64
thought was that a nimbin
was like an aboriginal.

150
00:11:21,66 --> 00:11:27,83
Wise man a holy man and. I've since heard
it's it's a spiritus or it's as well.

151
00:11:27,97 --> 00:11:34,95
Apparently the area wasn't was never actually
lived in by the corys they came here

152
00:11:35,83 --> 00:11:40,86
for the men and boys came here
for an initiation purposes

153
00:11:40,86 --> 00:11:44,65
or for religious ceremonies

154
00:11:44,66 --> 00:11:47,83
and then they went back to wherever they
lived i think they probably live closer to

155
00:11:47,83 --> 00:11:49,38
the coast where there was more fishing is

156
00:11:49,38 --> 00:11:51,92
that the bunch of young
people who were the product

157
00:11:51,92 --> 00:11:57,65
but the minute tribe of the area
were. Very much into their fishing.

158
00:11:59,18 --> 00:12:04,97
Coastal vise. Try by i mean they started
at bunge one when the old grandmother

159
00:12:04,97 --> 00:12:10,56
and her sons arrived at the
beach at evans head there

160
00:12:10,57 --> 00:12:13,70
and i think grandmother

161
00:12:13,70 --> 00:12:17,38
and one of her son fell asleep on the
other ones went off looking for food

162
00:12:17,38 --> 00:12:21,48
somewhere else and died and they
camped there on the hill at evans head

163
00:12:21,48 --> 00:12:25,06
and started off.

164
00:12:26,12 --> 00:12:29,44
So what exactly it means
i'm not sure except

165
00:12:29,44 --> 00:12:33,58
that it probably has a lot to do with
with something reasonably sacred to

166
00:12:34,76 --> 00:12:38,02
aborigines a name it sort of knew
lindsey was spelt like that.

167
00:12:38,13 --> 00:12:44,30
I suspect just to give people a
lot of trouble in saying it.

168
00:12:44,32 --> 00:12:49,02
The property was it was. Bought.

169
00:12:49,04 --> 00:12:52,95
Probably about six months after
the first of all probably took

170
00:12:52,95 --> 00:12:56,56
that long to get enough people together
with another finance to purchase it.

171
00:12:56,62 --> 00:13:00,17
I think it was found before that
there was quite a land oppression

172
00:13:00,17 --> 00:13:08,64
and properties for sale 1:50 remain
for sale for quite some time.

173
00:13:09,47 --> 00:13:13,50
The idea of this particular property
and buying it and getting a community.

174
00:13:13,89 --> 00:13:19,21
Happening here was the brainchild
of a man called brian joyce

175
00:13:19,21 --> 00:13:22,67
and the woman who was
living with sue sue lane

176
00:13:23,49 --> 00:13:26,18
and bryant came out looked
at the place took one look

177
00:13:26,18 --> 00:13:30,52
and said yes this is the place for me
and get it together is many friends

178
00:13:30,52 --> 00:13:33,66
and friends of friends and it was bought.

179
00:13:36,24 --> 00:13:39,66
I wasn't one of the original
46 people i came in.

180
00:13:39,82 --> 00:13:42,53
Probably no for you know
i mean i would think

181
00:13:42,53 --> 00:13:44,35
when a couple of other
people had sold out.

182
00:13:47,20 --> 00:13:49,79
And.

183
00:13:50,85 --> 00:13:55,86
Well it's hard as they are brian's ideals
i don't know brian's ideals coincide with

184
00:13:55,86 --> 00:13:59,70
every authority and i probably
didn't because he's gone. But.

185
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,57
His concept was of a community
of people that lived together.

186
00:14:07,23 --> 00:14:08,21
Very closely.

187
00:14:10,87 --> 00:14:15,32
A lot of close.

188
00:14:15,34 --> 00:14:19,33
I would say intense interpersonal
reactions very much.

189
00:14:19,36 --> 00:14:23,65
The encounter group type situation you
know your feeling shitty you say you're

190
00:14:23,65 --> 00:14:28,10
giving a shit today. You know just
the way you're looking whatever.

191
00:14:28,12 --> 00:14:29,82
It's it's not for a while.

192
00:14:29,89 --> 00:14:33,37
Be very difficult y to live
permanently and i think he felt

193
00:14:33,37 --> 00:14:40,23
that those ideal had been sacrificed
to other more pressing things like

194
00:14:40,23 --> 00:14:41,95
shelter and water and

195
00:14:41,95 --> 00:14:46,16
that people was spreading people building
houses separated away from the community

196
00:14:46,16 --> 00:14:49,95
house and weren't being seen for
days at a time and things like that.

197
00:14:51,31 --> 00:14:54,26
He never bothered with the house he just
moved into the old area that was here

198
00:14:54,26 --> 00:14:59,85
and lived there and wasn't
interested in anything agricultural

199
00:14:59,85 --> 00:15:02,00
or other or.

200
00:15:02,35 --> 00:15:08,64
He was definitely a people person
and he went back to the city and.

201
00:15:09,10 --> 00:15:16,94
Started a circus.

202
00:15:16,96 --> 00:15:23,34
In terms of what and what. A reason.

203
00:15:24,38 --> 00:15:26,24
Originally was sharing everything.

204
00:15:26,25 --> 00:15:33,03
Originally are all food was bought
just as a big bowl shop the at the

205
00:15:33,03 --> 00:15:36,38
community house there was a.
Large pantries now the office.

206
00:15:36,45 --> 00:15:40,57
Funny how things change where the filing
cabinet is now they used to be big bins

207
00:15:40,57 --> 00:15:41,51
full of grains

208
00:15:42,51 --> 00:15:49,15
and there was an attitude then
of trying to be agriculturally

209
00:15:49,16 --> 00:15:54,59
self-sufficient. That's never really
eventuated the soil is not great.

210
00:15:55,55 --> 00:15:59,46
And the people who are coming to live here
weren't really destined to be farmers

211
00:15:59,46 --> 00:15:59,96
around thing.

212
00:16:01,65 --> 00:16:05,78
With one of them were very people orientated
as well because social interactions

213
00:16:05,78 --> 00:16:08,46
always been a very large
part of this community.

214
00:16:08,67 --> 00:16:10,78
I suppose most communities
do when you're living

215
00:16:10,78 --> 00:16:12,63
and sharing a lot of
facilities with people.

216
00:16:14,42 --> 00:16:15,77
It's industry them and talk to them

217
00:16:15,77 --> 00:16:25,21
and whatever fight with them.

218
00:16:25,99 --> 00:16:29,74
So it's.

219
00:16:31,64 --> 00:16:37,83
It's been a very a very sort of organic
process the change. Once again primarily.

220
00:16:38,39 --> 00:16:41,05
To do with who was here at any given time

221
00:16:42,18 --> 00:16:46,36
and the type of person they
were whether they were.

222
00:16:47,12 --> 00:16:50,51
A dominant type of personality or
had very strong ideas and attitudes

223
00:16:50,51 --> 00:16:54,89
and they want to do particular things our
motivated you know i think if you've got

224
00:16:54,89 --> 00:16:57,07
people that are very motivated
to do a particular thing

225
00:16:57,07 --> 00:16:59,06
and can express their ideas well then.

226
00:16:59,30 --> 00:17:01,95
Other people who perhaps aren't
so motivated can think with that.

227
00:17:01,98 --> 00:17:07,77
Yeah that's a good way to go
destroy that. I mean. My lap.

228
00:17:07,99 --> 00:17:09,50
And mainly.

229
00:17:10,25 --> 00:17:13,88
One of the big things is everyone building
houses you know obviously getting

230
00:17:13,89 --> 00:17:17,43
individual shelter situation
especially as more

231
00:17:17,43 --> 00:17:19,55
and more people started
having families and

232
00:17:19,55 --> 00:17:23,99
when the people first bought the
property there was no children involved.

233
00:17:24,53 --> 00:17:25,75
One of the shareholders was pregnant

234
00:17:27,63 --> 00:17:32,48
and she had her child here on the
property up in the community house there.

235
00:17:32,71 --> 00:17:40,24
And since then there's been i think
15 children born on the property.

236
00:17:40,25 --> 00:17:40,96
So yeah.

237
00:17:40,99 --> 00:17:47,93
As people tended to have families perhaps
break up into more traditional nuclear

238
00:17:47,93 --> 00:17:54,00
family situations they built
themself nuclear family style houses

239
00:17:55,23 --> 00:17:59,15
in various spots around the property that
no one as yet has actually sort of guilt.

240
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,05
A group type of living situation you know
a number of for example single people

241
00:18:05,05 --> 00:18:07,71
building a place together
and and sharing it.

242
00:18:09,05 --> 00:18:15,91
A person like to see more
of them that. I haven't.

243
00:18:17,03 --> 00:18:18,75
I've got the wife and the two children.

244
00:18:20,30 --> 00:18:26,03
Everything according
to the city's 6 1 dog.

245
00:18:27,09 --> 00:18:36,19
Yes.

246
00:18:36,21 --> 00:18:40,58
Bush.

247
00:18:40,60 --> 00:18:44,59
It has it has because it had been a
bush experience of a nuclear power

248
00:18:44,59 --> 00:18:47,56
but not totally.

249
00:18:48,74 --> 00:18:53,08
Had it been a bush experience of the nuclear
family in some respects yes it has i

250
00:18:53,08 --> 00:18:54,48
mean i've got a house

251
00:18:55,77 --> 00:19:00,49
and we've got you know a veggie
garden next to the house. But.

252
00:19:01,16 --> 00:19:05,21
There's a large community vegetable
garden happening as well

253
00:19:05,21 --> 00:19:08,35
that a lot of the single people who are
here right now it's been a bit of a

254
00:19:08,35 --> 00:19:11,45
population shift of light.

255
00:19:13,22 --> 00:19:18,15
A number of the. All the people
have all the shareholders.

256
00:19:18,25 --> 00:19:23,83
More regional shareholders perhaps the
original shows rather than older. And down.

257
00:19:23,89 --> 00:19:24,45
I just feel like

258
00:19:24,45 --> 00:19:30,34
that have moved to lose more education
actually had a lot to do with that.

259
00:19:32,40 --> 00:19:36,89
There's no final he is living
in 12 in the knees yet so

260
00:19:36,89 --> 00:19:39,27
that the nearest high schools
if you've got children

261
00:19:39,27 --> 00:19:42,39
that are going on the year
11 and 12 is in lismore

262
00:19:42,39 --> 00:19:46,47
and it's obviously a damn sight easier
to go to high school isn't with you.

263
00:19:46,47 --> 00:19:50,30
Living it is more rather than
travel 60 or 70 caged on a bus.

264
00:19:51,73 --> 00:19:55,28
So that's been a factor.

265
00:19:56,70 --> 00:19:59,72
I guess is there are other factors
to diss wishing for more.

266
00:20:00,85 --> 00:20:06,88
Creature comforts perhaps
so wanting to. Have.

267
00:20:07,44 --> 00:20:13,39
A job that requires you being working
in lismore or elsewhere. Every day.

268
00:20:14,29 --> 00:20:18,60
If not the most convenient place to travel
to and from on a regular basis out here.

269
00:20:18,71 --> 00:20:25,52
I mean can be done just want to
wear and tear on your vehicle.

270
00:20:25,54 --> 00:20:29,80
The nuclear family in the bush this still
a lot of facilities that are shared.

271
00:20:30,07 --> 00:20:36,69
For example. Most people still do all
their washing in the community laundry.

272
00:20:39,30 --> 00:20:41,85
There are only a couple of pumping
systems that provide water.

273
00:20:42,34 --> 00:20:47,32
To the whole community. You know
so that example if the pump.

274
00:20:47,34 --> 00:20:49,31
Breaks down even though i
mightn't be the one that's using

275
00:20:49,31 --> 00:20:51,82
that particular pump i mop it
once it goes down and fixes it.

276
00:20:54,50 --> 00:20:58,29
Not that i'm saying i'm always thinking
that but i do i do fix the fun thing

277
00:20:58,29 --> 00:21:04,33
and again all the washing machines
are things like that are so

278
00:21:04,34 --> 00:21:05,95
and in terms of.

279
00:21:06,54 --> 00:21:11,36
The normal for example bills and debt

280
00:21:11,36 --> 00:21:17,69
that a nuclear family living alone on in
their own piece of land would incur that's

281
00:21:17,70 --> 00:21:23,79
something that i haven't had to live with
for example you know the rights and.

282
00:21:24,60 --> 00:21:26,55
Land taxes for example all

283
00:21:26,55 --> 00:21:32,32
that sort of stuff that's part of just
everyone pays a certain amount to the

284
00:21:32,32 --> 00:21:37,49
co-operative every year and that
covers all those types of bills so.

285
00:21:39,31 --> 00:21:43,68
Sharing certain things. Yes
and having your own as well.

286
00:21:47,03 --> 00:21:51,59
Definitely been financial benefits i mean
i couldn't of been unemployed for a good

287
00:21:51,59 --> 00:21:56,63
many years and i certainly
couldn't have heard of.

288
00:21:58,00 --> 00:21:59,79
Created this life almost
for myself unless.

289
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:07,40
I could have shared with other people.

290
00:22:14,18 --> 00:22:17,05
I suppose it was never a
stated goal originally

291
00:22:18,97 --> 00:22:22,28
but i suppose everybody would
have liked to would have had that

292
00:22:22,28 --> 00:22:26,94
that concept did to be able to somehow
be become economically independent

293
00:22:28,29 --> 00:22:32,88
and live this lifestyle is just
finding the way to doing it you know

294
00:22:35,29 --> 00:22:41,86
i'm still looking.

295
00:22:45,07 --> 00:22:49,42
I think. Group. As a.

296
00:22:50,29 --> 00:22:54,29
No not really not on this particular
community i mean other communities.

297
00:22:54,43 --> 00:23:01,21
I think have a perhaps more of a group
consciousness towards finance rising in and.

298
00:23:01,23 --> 00:23:05,63
Economic viability perhaps and it's.

299
00:23:07,84 --> 00:23:12,68
I mean community did a really just a
product of the sum total of the people who

300
00:23:12,68 --> 00:23:19,20
happen to partake of them and specially
with not so much because it's so large

301
00:23:19,20 --> 00:23:25,57
and it drew from such a a large
sort of database or person based

302
00:23:25,57 --> 00:23:26,82
when it originally set up it's got.

303
00:23:27,84 --> 00:23:29,85
Factions of all shapes sizes and colors

304
00:23:29,85 --> 00:23:34,39
but a number of the other
all the communities.

305
00:23:34,41 --> 00:23:38,46
Probably will started primarily
from a group of known friends.

306
00:23:38,93 --> 00:23:44,20
You know and known friends are usually
people with similar ideas and attitudes

307
00:23:44,20 --> 00:23:50,23
and aspirations do you usually you know
within certain boundaries of i think of the

308
00:23:50,23 --> 00:23:54,63
very middle class community with a lot of
people coming from generally middle class

309
00:23:55,46 --> 00:23:59,15
type backgrounds and probably lots
of holding a lot of middle class.

310
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,63
Asians an idea deep down underneath.
I mean i know the community.

311
00:24:06,64 --> 00:24:10,29
I've been back as well where almost
every shareholder school teacher.

312
00:24:11,06 --> 00:24:18,91
And they are very educationally involved.

313
00:24:20,48 --> 00:24:21,67
Fantastic fantastic.

314
00:24:22,17 --> 00:24:27,65
I can't think of a better place in terms
of some way to bring up one's children.

315
00:24:28,87 --> 00:24:31,98
I really can't think of a better place.

316
00:24:33,05 --> 00:24:39,43
Overall in terms of having having an
environment where your children can

317
00:24:40,96 --> 00:24:43,55
not come home necessarily from
the school bus in the afternoon

318
00:24:43,55 --> 00:24:44,58
and you won't see them till dark

319
00:24:44,58 --> 00:24:49,49
and yet you're not in the slightest bit
worried as to where they've gone they can

320
00:24:49,49 --> 00:24:52,15
be with somebody else on the community
you know of playing with some friends

321
00:24:52,15 --> 00:24:58,33
or going to somebody else's place that's
that's a lot of things is obviously great

322
00:24:58,33 --> 00:25:04,22
you know the children got a degree of
freedom. Perhaps and i suppose innocence.

323
00:25:04,28 --> 00:25:07,97
You know but a degree of freedom
that these days. I don't think is.

324
00:25:08,58 --> 00:25:15,36
Is possible in the urban environment.
They've learnt to grow up with some.

325
00:25:16,88 --> 00:25:20,92
What i consider good healthy attitudes
towards the environment they take

326
00:25:20,92 --> 00:25:24,25
environmental issues just
so much for granted.

327
00:25:24,73 --> 00:25:27,95
You know of course you don't rubbish
things of course you don't do this

328
00:25:27,95 --> 00:25:29,37
and of course you don't do that you know.

329
00:25:30,76 --> 00:25:34,18
Whereas out of here that we've
had to learn or take on board.

330
00:25:34,34 --> 00:25:40,39
You know for them it's just the way
it is and they've got i don't know.

331
00:25:40,59 --> 00:25:44,17
I don't have a normal
aspiration if under some has

332
00:25:44,17 --> 00:25:45,54
that won't want to get out there

333
00:25:45,54 --> 00:25:51,28
and make a million bucks get rich
come home go to their father.

334
00:25:52,61 --> 00:25:59,29
Others don't. My my children.

335
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:01,40
At this stage is still a bit.

336
00:26:01,46 --> 00:26:05,51
They're only just turning teenagers and
they haven't got any firm and fixed

337
00:26:05,51 --> 00:26:11,95
that attitude as to what they'd like to
really do themselves. Once i finish school.

338
00:26:11,96 --> 00:26:15,41
But i've seen a number
of children grow up here

339
00:26:15,41 --> 00:26:19,53
and leave as what i consider
good adults you know like.

340
00:26:19,92 --> 00:26:25,68
Interesting people good
attitudes do well it's cool.

341
00:26:27,24 --> 00:26:31,41
I certainly haven't. Well you know.
The people who haven't tried to.

342
00:26:31,95 --> 00:26:33,47
Anyway sort of style.

343
00:26:33,47 --> 00:26:44,85
If i education as such.

344
00:26:46,00 --> 00:26:48,96
Well not the children here have gone.

345
00:26:48,98 --> 00:26:55,84
Of all gone to the local public primary
school back as well which is a

346
00:26:56,55 --> 00:27:01,56
very nice little countries go
nowhere near town about 100 people

347
00:27:04,29 --> 00:27:06,24
for teachers just a very good school.

348
00:27:06,30 --> 00:27:09,53
It's got an enormous amount of
community input into from the parents.

349
00:27:10,49 --> 00:27:11,63
It's perhaps the best of both worlds.

350
00:27:11,89 --> 00:27:13,41
You know it's free public education

351
00:27:14,87 --> 00:27:20,40
and it's got enough external
input that there are.

352
00:27:20,78 --> 00:27:24,20
That. I don't know it's.

353
00:27:26,25 --> 00:27:30,58
Off as a lot of schools have parents input
it just seems to have a lot of very

354
00:27:30,58 --> 00:27:31,91
positive hearing when but they have a.

355
00:27:33,57 --> 00:27:38,32
Things like oh cultural options which
is when parents will come along

356
00:27:38,32 --> 00:27:41,65
and one day a week for
maybe a month or six weeks

357
00:27:42,38 --> 00:27:44,76
and take a small group of
children in a particular.

358
00:27:46,41 --> 00:27:51,32
Anything i just it's a group of kids
making windchimes out of all forks

359
00:27:51,32 --> 00:27:56,48
and spoons and another woman
did felt making and just just.

360
00:27:57,04 --> 00:27:58,87
Skills things like that.

361
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:03,25
And opportunities for
kids to learn things like

362
00:28:13,93 --> 00:28:17,84
a favorite nimbin the story. The.

363
00:28:20,07 --> 00:28:24,43
Ah.

364
00:28:26,84 --> 00:28:28,50
I'll ponder that one ask
me another question

365
00:28:28,50 --> 00:28:36,33
and i well i think i had to put the
pause button on five newman's change.

366
00:28:36,34 --> 00:28:41,69
A sense of place in the now i really
feel proud to say you know i'm from them

367
00:28:41,69 --> 00:28:45,20
and you're through i come from
years ago i say i'm from.

368
00:28:46,08 --> 00:28:48,47
Barker's violence between
chi ogle no will no.

369
00:28:50,80 --> 00:28:55,80
But now i'm from nimbin just
out of nimbin actually yeah.

370
00:28:55,82 --> 00:29:00,11
No it was it was the people
thing that drew drew me here

371
00:29:00,11 --> 00:29:06,19
that i was particularly attracted to just
the idea of settling in an area with

372
00:29:07,16 --> 00:29:10,86
lots of like minded people
you know kith and kin.

373
00:29:10,88 --> 00:29:15,90
And creating a community where you felt
like you weren't one of the minority

374
00:29:17,12 --> 00:29:18,99
but that but that you were
one of the establishment.

375
00:29:20,59 --> 00:29:22,59
Even though it was your own establishment.

376
00:29:22,69 --> 00:29:27,53
I think that's still what is perhaps my
strongest feeling about newman you know

377
00:29:28,68 --> 00:29:32,15
especially of being a wife a little bit my
drive back in there today even for a few

378
00:29:32,15 --> 00:29:36,02
days you drive into town. It's just
so different from anywhere else.

379
00:29:36,16 --> 00:29:39,44
You know anything. How and
then then home again you know

380
00:29:40,25 --> 00:29:43,45
and there's total out of it.

381
00:29:43,55 --> 00:29:46,59
There are leagues collapsed in front of
the hot bread shop there was yes i was

382
00:29:46,59 --> 00:29:48,96
wonderful.

383
00:29:48,97 --> 00:29:52,62
Right at their doorstep you said that
their mattresses check hadn't come in

384
00:29:54,15 --> 00:29:59,95
and the usual cluster outside
the rainbow and just.

385
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:06,18
Just all sorts of characters you know
people are in really disreputable baggy old

386
00:30:06,18 --> 00:30:12,64
tights wandering along. Yeah
just just the colour and.

387
00:30:12,66 --> 00:30:16,99
The non-conformist well it's pretty
conforming within isn't it. I mean really.

388
00:30:18,56 --> 00:30:19,38
I simply like it

389
00:30:19,38 --> 00:30:23,75
when the rat pack came to town with with
their shredded clothes in their dreadlocks

390
00:30:23,75 --> 00:30:25,79
to their knees and things
like oh wonderful looking

391
00:30:25,79 --> 00:30:29,66
and i like it visually
visually exciting them

392
00:30:31,51 --> 00:30:36,78
and i like a like the whole aspect
of change to a like the fact

393
00:30:36,78 --> 00:30:41,02
that there's all these things happening
this is permaculture village i really hope

394
00:30:41,02 --> 00:30:45,80
kicks off in them and just because it
will mean yet another group of people

395
00:30:45,80 --> 00:30:48,48
and more change and i enjoy change.

396
00:30:49,87 --> 00:30:52,23
You know it's not always for
the best but i just like

397
00:30:52,23 --> 00:30:56,48
that dynamics of it not just
being something stagnant

398
00:30:56,48 --> 00:30:59,60
that we're whole lot of
all hippies went to die.

399
00:30:59,62 --> 00:31:05,05
But somewhere where a whole lot of new
hippies are coming to live as well you know

400
00:31:05,05 --> 00:31:09,58
i like seeing the young people
not as hippies as people.

401
00:31:10,52 --> 00:31:13,95
I mean this is lots of a lot of people
around here these are in a place

402
00:31:13,95 --> 00:31:20,17
that have moved in them and for
whatever reasons. Good solid people.

403
00:31:23,50 --> 00:31:24,82
Yes well.

404
00:31:24,83 --> 00:31:26,37
There are a few challenges from them

405
00:31:26,37 --> 00:31:29,17
and i think the sewerage one of the
big challenges is it and for that.
