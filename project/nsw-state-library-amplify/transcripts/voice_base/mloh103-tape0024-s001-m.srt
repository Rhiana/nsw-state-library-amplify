Bit of a shock shock. Image. Well the great dozer and company.

12
00:02:19,02 --> 00:02:23,88
And it sort of got known as a dollar man because as if the great doze of flesh is the dollar

13
00:02:23,88 --> 00:02:37,75
and seem to be into dollars. Destroying the environment with a dollar or using the dollar as a. As a weapon. Again.

14
00:02:38,23 --> 00:02:49,53
This is so i came here. He nine hundred seventy three. With a performance troupe we called ourselves the.

15
00:02:49,53 --> 00:03:00,51
The cost of coffee and i'm there the metaphysical magic and i would call this a metaphysical metal chair

16
00:03:00,51 --> 00:03:05,96
and we came with a performance. On the wells which we. Trumped up.

17
00:03:05,96 --> 00:03:12,38
It was a time machine we tramped it up into sort of like the mechanical people. And the beautiful people.

18
00:03:12,38 --> 00:03:16,57
You know sort of the mechanical and the people in a more free spirit living on the earth.

19
00:03:16,57 --> 00:03:22,5
And you had the mechanical people the van of the good which was a sort of split of height you wealth of have a society

20
00:03:22,5 --> 00:03:31,59
will split in the future. And out of sight of the plight of time travel. Is it and when we sort of.

21
00:03:31,59 --> 00:03:40,96
It was very interesting it sort of really worked because it was very fitting. To the environment. But when i came here.

22
00:03:40,96 --> 00:03:50,43
After props. Ended up taking off to sea bryza been we were asked in the field there and we setting up a sort of.

23
00:03:50,43 --> 00:03:56,13
Spot and i ended up doing dance workshops every morning in the main town hall for through up and then we.

24
00:03:56,13 --> 00:04:01,44
Towards the end of the festival we had to weigh a prop stand we did our performance. I would just sort of. You know.

25
00:04:01,44 --> 00:04:06,72
The group of us just went around just did things all around for so much going on you just sort of participate

26
00:04:06,72 --> 00:04:16,5
and just become more free form and in participating. Around the. This the area around the site area.

27
00:04:16,93 --> 00:04:29,47
And participating in forums and. Writing with the different bands and getting with other people doing things.

28
00:04:29,47 --> 00:04:38,67
Well the highlight was doing the performance. It was quite. Mr mysterious event.

29
00:04:38,67 --> 00:04:44,92
The acoustic was in the year in the bush factory before was the bush fact it was all the scaffolding. Set up.

30
00:04:44,92 --> 00:04:51,97
And i remember we had the screen up there and. And i was i used the scaffolding to get these dramatic sounds and.

31
00:04:51,97 --> 00:04:58,51
It just sort of created these dramatic samples we had these had this sort of beautiful white garments with feet turned

32
00:04:58,51 --> 00:05:01,69
around was blackened and skulls.

33
00:05:01,69 --> 00:05:07,95
In there and so we had to sort of contrast the images of this is of just really lawit characters and then.

34
00:05:07,95 --> 00:05:12,5
Them with a large show we had. Tom power doing. Poetry right if you know tom.

35
00:05:12,5 --> 00:05:15,33
And he was doing sort of a sort of free form.

36
00:05:15,33 --> 00:05:22,09
Poetry interludes to interact with the with the people in and telling them the story of the time.

37
00:05:22,09 --> 00:05:30,08
Machine so was was semi. We used the script as a sort of improvise to improvise on. And sometimes the movements.

38
00:05:30,08 --> 00:05:37,01
So it was all that sort of hanging out on the on that and. And interacting with people with fruit you know.

39
00:05:37,01 --> 00:05:44,93
Calling it would bowls of fruit. And with that with the the loiters of beautiful people and then.

40
00:05:44,93 --> 00:05:51,83
There are some angelic i was the execution that sort of chopping off people's heads you know with these magic.

41
00:05:51,83 --> 00:06:02,33
In terms of. You know we're doing the the. The mechanical stuff and so was the processing going in.

42
00:06:02,33 --> 00:06:14,72
It was very interesting because at that place the bush fact he was a mate works to. And you know later dies and.

43
00:06:14,72 --> 00:06:33,04
He would not synergy there. Still got nice energy today. All the bush radio here was set up by a whole group.

44
00:06:33,04 --> 00:06:38,02
Combined group of people. Which was which just.

45
00:06:38,02 --> 00:06:45,39
From the universities the universities were just getting into sort of puerto pacs. I mean puerto pacs and then.

46
00:06:45,39 --> 00:06:47,1
Interacting with the community.

47
00:06:47,1 --> 00:06:51,1
On issues where people can type the types out

48
00:06:51,1 --> 00:07:00,72
and people can go out there mike mike mike their own video what's a random and. Get feedback and just.

49
00:07:00,72 --> 00:07:06,79
Was sort of the that process just came on that on the market so called group came up here

50
00:07:06,79 --> 00:07:18,85
and decided to set up i set up a whole network with within the live with the cable link up for the sot just ideas and.

51
00:07:18,85 --> 00:07:25,33
And just developing their technology as a sort of an internal monitoring of what's going on people went out in the

52
00:07:25,33 --> 00:07:31,07
field and took it up put a pex and. Video type what i wanted them. You know and.

53
00:07:31,07 --> 00:07:41,18
And then brought it back and that was shown to have people. People just look at it. And so yeah well i just saw.

54
00:07:41,18 --> 00:07:48,57
It was all done by young people who never didn't know how bad it is just sort of they're learning about it and lot of.

55
00:07:48,57 --> 00:07:56,55
And even people within the field are just learning about had to handle this. This equipment and. So it's and squatter.

56
00:07:56,55 --> 00:07:57,85
You know. Having them.

57
00:07:57,85 --> 00:08:11,08
It's quite expensive to our member that had one heart it was a birthing that took place on the at the.

58
00:08:11,08 --> 00:08:20,99
And at the first i saw that i was quite incredible. Actually a birth at the. Aquarius festival was actually.

59
00:08:20,99 --> 00:08:30,85
Monitored back from the day before. To people. Just the whole thing was that it was quite a culture shock for me.

60
00:08:30,85 --> 00:08:39,52
But that was that was that was one of the things it was a hamas and it was on on the on the on the. The box around.

61
00:08:39,52 --> 00:08:52,04
Special. Postings around town. Well you had different stages for one. You know dollar brand.

62
00:08:52,04 --> 00:08:58,52
Was a hot one of the highlights he was doing music you know you could be doing. Long stints of piano applying.

63
00:08:58,52 --> 00:09:00,7
Really being from south africa.

64
00:09:00,7 --> 00:09:05,49
It was great and i used to go down and dance and do interact with dance with people

65
00:09:05,49 --> 00:09:14,35
and get these things happening with him develop these sort of things that was part of my thing it was not only was i

66
00:09:14,35 --> 00:09:22,45
dance. You know. Trying dancer turned into. You know freeing up the form.

67
00:09:22,45 --> 00:09:26,75
But i developed in that form through the melbourne. Early stages in melbourne.

68
00:09:26,75 --> 00:09:31,12
In the in that sort of light sixty's and seventy's and interact with bands

69
00:09:31,12 --> 00:09:37,52
and sort of become a cat i used as a sort of a catalyst. A form of catalyst to together.

70
00:09:39,36 --> 00:09:47,04
There was a nine like i developed a name for it was sort of like a crowd. A crowd.

71
00:09:47,04 --> 00:09:51,01
Stimulator some of that a crowd of us and i got beat i had.

72
00:09:51,01 --> 00:09:57,33
I was doing things the disco is where i'll be on stage and i'll go up and do things and so congo lines and.

73
00:09:57,33 --> 00:10:03,57
Little groups dancing and writing as a sort of just toy. You know ends up so there's a focus. So you so you.

74
00:10:03,57 --> 00:10:07,05
So you take. Take the whole dance thing.

75
00:10:07,05 --> 00:10:16,5
Into wrecked the dance thing so you get these groups things happening with bands. Of people.

76
00:10:16,72 --> 00:10:22,59
And the other things are just other things that took place during the day things was just.

77
00:10:22,59 --> 00:10:32,17
There was also philip to eat during these high wind up that really was a my thing. And it was the writing for. I.e.

78
00:10:32,17 --> 00:10:40,74
Sort of just you know put up. You just sort of. Coming with a unicycle on your string up.

79
00:10:40,74 --> 00:10:44,63
You know it's just this thing.

80
00:10:44,63 --> 00:10:48,97
Thing guy with a black hat he was dressed in black with tiles and that you know just coming in

81
00:10:48,97 --> 00:10:57,95
and your drawer this law i mean you know. Any staff. Doing this thing with the. First of all the clearly.

82
00:10:57,95 --> 00:11:05,29
The spice by using a unicycle to create a space and i just and draw the line around.

83
00:11:05,29 --> 00:11:10,44
Did all the sort of traditional french. Sort of mind. Type sequences.

84
00:11:10,44 --> 00:11:14,29
So you get to committee i was no voice it was just my man.

85
00:11:14,29 --> 00:11:20,94
And he had these juggling all this sort of things that's pretty much in vogue with with. Street performers.

86
00:11:20,94 --> 00:11:23,55
There of which he was a sort of. He brought it.

87
00:11:23,55 --> 00:11:31,16
Pretty fresh into this country wasn't going to know was probably was probably the first straight performer. Doing it.

88
00:11:31,16 --> 00:11:35,01
Yeah. You know a strike. Because it was pretty much like.

89
00:11:35,01 --> 00:11:42,23
It was a strain saying he had to go through some strange scenes here because it was pretty much.

90
00:11:42,23 --> 00:11:48,57
The authorities wouldn't allow him to do the sort of things that wasn't there wasn't a forum for bass things have to be

91
00:11:48,57 --> 00:11:55,23
battled down the track. To win. You know getting by laws passed that people could do these things.

92
00:11:55,23 --> 00:11:59,92
But at first he just sort of like the queries first it was a good forum for him to try this have seen was an eye open

93
00:11:59,92 --> 00:12:10,64
for open. Social forum. To try out new ideas and street theatre.

94
00:12:10,64 --> 00:12:15,33
In many forms were taking place not only just for the potato but he used to string up the wire

95
00:12:15,33 --> 00:12:19,77
and he did that in a big. In the pub in mid to madison and you know.

96
00:12:19,77 --> 00:12:24,9
This sort of tomato soup which the neighborhood sent to your center now and used to do the thing then just go

97
00:12:24,9 --> 00:12:33,71
and how is just amazing it just did these things and he had to prepare taishan of. Of string up the the high wire.

98
00:12:33,71 --> 00:12:39,52
On the not in high places around the world leaks and he did. When he went to sydney tried it did it on the.

99
00:12:39,52 --> 00:12:45,26
Sydney harbor and i saw they start the take down he's right. When he was up there the authorities freaked.

100
00:12:45,36 --> 00:12:49,15
It was really dangerous he was sort of like the way actually i'm doing the right when he was up there

101
00:12:49,15 --> 00:12:54,01
and see these things. And i think it's pretty dangerous thing to do.

102
00:12:54,22 --> 00:12:59,66
But he was he was a highlight for me sort of just observing him and there was fred robinson

103
00:12:59,66 --> 00:13:06,95
and he's your rant you're right if you notice there's a whole new i g o of this whole connection.

104
00:13:07,67 --> 00:13:16,5
You knew i had sort of thinking so. Around. I was the food. You know that i sort of. Trust food thing in the food.

105
00:13:16,5 --> 00:13:25,61
Kitchen was all that sort of. Cooperate. You know people. On trust and cooperation. The whole. Festival was based on.

106
00:13:25,61 --> 00:13:31,83
Just allowing any of us the shitters like there's a whole things that i was quite think i was one of the first it was.

107
00:13:32,37 --> 00:13:37,58
Well first i'm live i'm into a fist a way where way. Everybody just was in a circle.

108
00:13:37,58 --> 00:13:44,22
In any shape in a circle like you know and all had this circle and you know it was all hope

109
00:13:44,22 --> 00:13:50,96
and there was sort of makes you know as you know i was no. Sort of sick. Sexual sort of.

110
00:13:50,96 --> 00:13:58,57
Division everybody came in there and. Just come pasta the spot on the floor and you become ill. You know i was a whole.

111
00:13:58,57 --> 00:14:04,86
Awareness of you know. I was very good because as they become aware of your own. Bodily functions and.

112
00:14:04,86 --> 00:14:11,69
Broke down a lot of missed. Myths from living in the city. And i was there was another good seeing and.

113
00:14:11,69 --> 00:14:18,43
And there was the song warners and my own sort of these things that are. And just me.

114
00:14:18,43 --> 00:14:24,24
And the bamboo bridges across the creek was with form of this that all these things all these hats

115
00:14:24,24 --> 00:14:33,77
and things that were built out of all of these diverse the writing. I write of. The wellings that we've put up.

116
00:14:33,77 --> 00:14:38,21
And and remember as theater group. Developed.

117
00:14:38,21 --> 00:14:46,25
And as sort of the well developed wellington you know how you're relating to where it's all so i think it was

118
00:14:46,25 --> 00:14:52,65
interesting because it was pretty. Ratty tatty thing you know. But it was sort of.

119
00:14:52,65 --> 00:14:59,2
You know going to bend it for you but we said that it was a place where we got on there was a plastic and.

120
00:14:59,2 --> 00:15:13,79
And bamboo and stuff. And it kept that. And there was it was sheltered. And we had a shelter up. You can not.

121
00:15:17,53 --> 00:15:19,95
I came to nimbin as well like a cat.

122
00:15:19,95 --> 00:15:25,9
Our life just came down with this with the trip to be part of this festival because i was at festivals like.

123
00:15:25,9 --> 00:15:30,37
It's not the first festival i went to. I was part of the sort of.

124
00:15:30,37 --> 00:15:43,81
Festival drifts like ten alone and not before i was in town when i was pong. And and. In victoria we had.

125
00:15:46,17 --> 00:15:51,37
Was it was sun brain yes it was the sun breeze and.

126
00:15:51,37 --> 00:15:57,87
The one before that i think kathy was lying but there was a few of these sort of events and also being part of.

127
00:15:57,87 --> 00:16:12,15
You know. Indoor events. With much more boredom and. My will that's called sort of into media. Get togethers. And.

128
00:16:12,15 --> 00:16:21,65
So yeah. So there was there was that connection. And that's what i. Got here it's just just widen the hole.

129
00:16:21,65 --> 00:16:30,12
You know what. What festivals. Can do. Like festivals we're actually setting up. Social. You know.

130
00:16:30,12 --> 00:16:34,77
He really can learn from festivals a lot. I mean these days that.

131
00:16:34,77 --> 00:16:40,31
You learn about society as aziz and people learn there and they can change they can learn to change

132
00:16:40,31 --> 00:16:45,27
but you just set up experiments and it's funny temporary i mean it's something that's going to be temporary but.

133
00:16:45,27 --> 00:16:57,97
You can really go forward. And just do it as a as a marker scope on ideas with everybody.

134
00:16:57,97 --> 00:17:05,28
I started on because then it was the. The idea of state of getting a community. Well getting.

135
00:17:05,28 --> 00:17:10,54
Probably many for many reasons to get a hold of it probably so that the people that i hear.

136
00:17:10,54 --> 00:17:17,65
Have a place where they can keep their ideas going like develop their ideas from their experience from the aquarius

137
00:17:17,65 --> 00:17:22,12
festival. And people had different ideas like that the total commune idea of.

138
00:17:22,12 --> 00:17:26,05
Like a way of living here during the a chris festival forming this.

139
00:17:26,05 --> 00:17:33,73
This site where we all care and share and do everything. So you know get some probably and try and do that and it was.

140
00:17:33,73 --> 00:17:41,05
It was that sort of idealistic. Idealism that was around at the time and also very poor people. You know. Very poor.

141
00:17:41,05 --> 00:17:49,83
We had to work something here we do it and. And also people that had dropped out. As such and.

142
00:17:49,83 --> 00:17:58,65
And were shot in the pond in different ways because they were. Not part of the status quo in.

143
00:17:58,65 --> 00:17:58,73
Types

144
00:17:58,73 --> 00:18:05,55
and it was students as well because there was this disillusionment there's a lot of social reasons why this of second

145
00:18:05,55 --> 00:18:13,55
place the disillusionment with the whole. Was this. With the war with the war mentality and. And this the whole.

146
00:18:13,55 --> 00:18:24,17
Philosophical discussion about that as. That you towards. You know we had real social problems. To sort out.

147
00:18:24,17 --> 00:18:30,55
And let alone. The. The earth and getting back to the guy in the sort of was the sort of spinoff from woodstock.

148
00:18:30,55 --> 00:18:38,36
Itself life as well. And that that was it that had a big impact on me you know like woodstock itself.

149
00:18:39,56 --> 00:18:42,89
And i guess a lot of people here i think that's as it was a human thing and this.

150
00:18:42,89 --> 00:18:47,93
This became this sort of a stray as woodstock. That's have turned out to be other.

151
00:18:47,93 --> 00:18:51,69
I don't know who was intentionally but it was. What the university setting him on.

152
00:18:51,69 --> 00:18:58,28
You know was going to be a would still. But it. It was that because. Woodstock was also.

153
00:18:58,28 --> 00:19:01,81
When i was i ever in america discovered that. And reading about.

154
00:19:01,81 --> 00:19:09,18
That was the same thing was going on there was that disillusionment and. And this that all these philosophers and.

155
00:19:09,18 --> 00:19:21,19
Writers and musicians and trying to express a different world from the world of of. Of competitive. Smashing and.

156
00:19:21,19 --> 00:19:28,55
Pushing and killing and writing. To something that's. That gets back to the earth and gentle caring.

157
00:19:28,55 --> 00:19:34,66
All that sort of all those sort of. That sort of society. Develop a society.

158
00:19:34,66 --> 00:19:47,74
In that sort of winds and i give him the name aquarius. This how did that. Progress.

159
00:19:47,93 --> 00:19:53,26
Well we just have to work on our ideas and i mean it's so it's.

160
00:19:53,26 --> 00:20:03,26
To me it's been successful because it's successful as much energy of. What people have discovered. And certain.

161
00:20:03,26 --> 00:20:09,56
There's a lot of what. What has been experimented on is to self into the mainstream. Like the mainstream just takes.

162
00:20:09,56 --> 00:20:16,5
The cream of ideas. That really you know that they see can work with mainstream and. You know you.

163
00:20:16,69 --> 00:20:24,06
Have alternative healing process is the health. Health food. That you carry an ism. That has been advanced.

164
00:20:24,06 --> 00:20:33,92
From that sort of thinking. The whole of these different. Co-ops. That around the place. You know. And the war.

165
00:20:34,37 --> 00:20:40,58
Now listen less people. Getting away from thinking about that fighting and finding solutions to.

166
00:20:40,58 --> 00:20:50,1
Conflict resolution and. It is quite you know it's just a lot of. And just in the health and healing.

167
00:20:50,1 --> 00:21:00,36
Aspect as hades in the perma culture and that's developed but it sort of grew out of that. Interest in the earth and.

168
00:21:00,36 --> 00:21:04,02
An alternative. Thing. Seems of internal. To monaco.

169
00:21:04,02 --> 00:21:10,82
Culture that some people living on the earth here are realizing that monoculture is destroying the earth.

170
00:21:10,82 --> 00:21:17,07
But it's just part of that thinking that's that lateral thinking it's not that there's not that sort of level way where

171
00:21:17,07 --> 00:21:23,37
you think that as a society. We could this is the why. It is is the way it can't be changed from there.

172
00:21:23,37 --> 00:21:26,25
Because the opposite society but actual fact that you use.

173
00:21:26,25 --> 00:21:36,25
That there is a role for for dropping out and trying out ideas as part of the. Creative artists.

174
00:21:36,25 --> 00:21:47,81
Role of taking on that role. So it's all eyes on our. I enjoy. That whole investigation the seeking role.

175
00:21:47,81 --> 00:21:55,65
And the funders. That's a real. It's not. Not new it's not even move. Aquarius was just a time.

176
00:21:55,65 --> 00:22:00,36
That sort of just highlight it i mean that's goes on throughout the ages see if you look back.

177
00:22:00,36 --> 00:22:05,01
He really getting into the interior is that you have this sort of.

178
00:22:05,01 --> 00:22:13,58
Line of thinking that goes right back in time here since. In humans or upon this earth this sort of thing that.

179
00:22:13,58 --> 00:22:19,69
That development has created the world we were in. Sort of civil. Civilized nation all.

180
00:22:19,69 --> 00:22:26,97
Thing is just part of the concepts that came up. People to try and.

181
00:22:26,97 --> 00:22:34,77
You know this sort of that somehow we live with the earth and. The creatures around us.

182
00:22:34,77 --> 00:22:38,64
And then we have all these problems and then we're going to solve these problems so it needs.

183
00:22:38,64 --> 00:22:44,76
Certain things and you have different. And communication. You know. Communication the.

184
00:22:44,76 --> 00:22:52,97
Communication chains like you have the you are nice and spirit. Which was a real change now times in relation to the.

185
00:22:55,78 --> 00:23:01,00
That stands out because it was a radical child with technology. Because i was all set to do it makes.

186
00:23:01,00 --> 00:23:08,57
Mixing with technology and. And they never became this sort of technology to rot in that time.

187
00:23:08,57 --> 00:23:21,02
The printing press and the. Building a whole lot of. You know. Architecture building. In temples.

188
00:23:21,02 --> 00:23:30,23
And it was a sort of european sort of connection going on this sort of internationalisation. Happening. So the post.

189
00:23:30,23 --> 00:23:36,66
Post. Roman empire times. And sort of. Coming out of the middle ages. Incident this.

190
00:23:36,66 --> 00:23:40,24
Coming out of the void said that there was that there was a sort of a period that sort of.

191
00:23:40,24 --> 00:23:44,8
And a spiritual awakening and this also spirituality is part of a process.

192
00:23:44,8 --> 00:23:54,07
That's something else that's that's found here in him been that there was investigation into alternative spirituality

193
00:23:54,07 --> 00:24:01,36
there was a dissolution of krista due to day made by simply who we've. The people that came to this.

194
00:24:01,36 --> 00:24:05,33
What people from that sort of you guy christian background.

195
00:24:05,33 --> 00:24:12,13
And of quite disillusioned because that sort of really created. That world that. That we rebelled against.

196
00:24:12,13 --> 00:24:21,47
And sort of was. Which sort of related to. Punishment and guilt and all that and was sort of.

197
00:24:21,47 --> 00:24:26,76
Free ourselves off from that. And with us. You had a christian is he also vegetarianism.

198
00:24:26,76 --> 00:24:36,44
The christians were part of that sort of culture that. There was around there. And there was a way here. In terms of.

199
00:24:36,44 --> 00:24:44,6
That brought their culture their culture here and it was all caught on now i have spiritual groups and sort of new age.

200
00:24:44,6 --> 00:24:52,83
Christian groups as well sort of. And in buddhism and. Buddhism took off quite strong. After you chris first of all.

201
00:24:52,83 --> 00:24:59,88
It's a very kind of quite a strong thing as and it was in my direction. I mean. Not everybody become a buddhist but.

202
00:24:59,88 --> 00:25:08,22
I had a very strong had a big impact on my life is is being able to sit and observe. In a life. You know.

203
00:25:08,22 --> 00:25:17,79
You know activity. And become aware. In that shop in my awareness. Still point. And yoga. That sort of bodily.

204
00:25:17,79 --> 00:25:24,11
I think you know yoga in touch all these things that you could do way up here in this special place this place just

205
00:25:24,11 --> 00:25:29,22
turned out to be. So special with the rocks in the valley. You just create a special.

206
00:25:29,22 --> 00:25:34,79
There's a certain energy about this place and then there's the aboriginal. Connection with this place and.

207
00:25:35,91 --> 00:25:40,39
A lot of things that just the mystery of this place is something special about me i mean.

208
00:25:40,39 --> 00:25:47,6
I kept my finger on i don't know of anyone. Previous put the thing but a certainly has a magical it sort of that.

209
00:25:48,93 --> 00:26:00,68
It creates inspiration. Yeah yeah there are yes. Yes. It's good coming back to the place and see the that.

210
00:26:00,68 --> 00:26:07,15
The place is not being very radically altered even though i was sort of fearing there's going to be radical alterations

211
00:26:07,15 --> 00:26:16,5
coming up. And there. But it's also that there is that there's a. There's this. It's this people this.

212
00:26:16,58 --> 00:26:20,16
All these hard thing connections are still there. He she.

213
00:26:20,16 --> 00:26:25,81
If you look forward it's around all those other connections with all that accrue stuff that happened during the korea's

214
00:26:25,81 --> 00:26:46,98
first of all is is a rare. You know it's. In the area. Yes..

215
00:26:36,65 --> 00:26:45,94
Oh oh oh well this is a model artistic google doodle or sexually it's a sort of self-seeking. And then x.

216
00:26:46,98 --> 00:26:59,5
Externalizing it. In terms of design the bubbles are. Well as i knew bubbles sort of grew out of the.

217
00:26:59,5 --> 00:27:08,22
Well after the aquarius first of all. I just decided to change. You know create this character.

218
00:27:08,22 --> 00:27:18,2
Before that i had a red. Pair of tights. And you know us i just had just ordinary tarts and dance things and and.

219
00:27:18,2 --> 00:27:23,02
You know the time traveler. Was pretty much in costumes and terms of.

220
00:27:23,02 --> 00:27:27,11
There was just a part of the performance

221
00:27:27,11 --> 00:27:35,68
but now i wanted to do it as an environmental piece by going to expand my ideas. And also as a clam character and.

222
00:27:35,68 --> 00:27:44,21
Because it was sort of a community now. It's just one expanded that i just just came to my he had just an idea. And.

223
00:27:44,21 --> 00:27:52,4
So i just started developing and. But it was in the sixty's. Was was in early seventy's.

224
00:27:52,4 --> 00:28:02,82
Sunni sunni while after sixty nine because i was overseas six and sixty nine and. Started to.

225
00:28:02,82 --> 00:28:11,35
I did a series of paintings which were on the bubble and would sort of drift. Bubbles drifting through voids and and.

226
00:28:11,35 --> 00:28:21,26
Out of flying into. Crevices and coming out of clouds and. And there and going through a maybe is.

227
00:28:21,26 --> 00:28:29,51
Is just and different getting into spirals and. Just the dots. Getting into all these sort of other images.

228
00:28:29,51 --> 00:28:39,57
And you have to look at it like i just created this whole. Working with with. With time and spices. And shipe and and.

229
00:28:39,57 --> 00:28:44,13
Just exploring it. And just from that's a round hole.

230
00:28:44,13 --> 00:28:52,58
And if i draw in the round or mean i sort of get into that meditation of doing. Circles. Very simple.

231
00:28:52,58 --> 00:29:01,24
And just the ideas spinning off. One after the other. As i did a series of campuses in melbourne big. Campuses and.

232
00:29:01,24 --> 00:29:08,77
They never really. Completed. Because completely because i was part of a community. At the cannery i asked santa.

233
00:29:08,77 --> 00:29:15,25
We started a group of us. Broke away from the pram factory in. Calton saying he wanted to start something. Away.

234
00:29:15,25 --> 00:29:22,26
But it sort of got. Lumbered with the council. Sort of. Really you know because it was so.

235
00:29:22,26 --> 00:29:33,07
It was you know sort of a rich sea area. They couldn't hack us you know i was right there in in. In the electorate of.

236
00:29:33,07 --> 00:29:44,24
Of. Prime minister of the time. Yeah. One of the prime ministers and so you know it was sort of. It sort of.

237
00:29:44,24 --> 00:29:45,92
Was a whole lot of ripping.

238
00:29:45,92 --> 00:29:49,71
You know sort of blocks and clothes that got more expensive

239
00:29:49,71 --> 00:29:53,6
and the council wanted to do with this big theatre down into something else.

240
00:29:53,6 --> 00:29:58,47
And it was that of the residence groups there. And for the saif.

241
00:29:58,47 --> 00:30:05,88
It's a very the that that whole is to beautiful buildings they're the old buildings.

242
00:30:05,88 --> 00:30:12,83
That's another story that i was into that to you about is the hard rock stuff that was in child not the time i mean you

243
00:30:12,83 --> 00:30:23,8
saw the paintings of all building a song the old. Environment. There was a stuff.

244
00:30:23,8 --> 00:30:30,78
So you know i lost my son so i thought oh well from that story.

245
00:30:30,78 --> 00:30:36,21
So well so you know well that beppe developed later on and so desire new bubbles was the character.

246
00:30:36,21 --> 00:30:43,94
But i didn't plan to paint shop fronts and even with that it's just that i had that and i. And i i had.

247
00:30:43,94 --> 00:30:54,72
I didn't i was seven years later when i came to me and been. And i was designing bubbles at the time. And.

248
00:30:54,72 --> 00:31:01,38
And graeme danson actually wrote write to me in melbourne. Also spending six months down here. Up here.

249
00:31:01,38 --> 00:31:09,00
Put put money into i have exhibitions than i did. All buildings and places. And workshops in melbourne.

250
00:31:09,00 --> 00:31:17,53
As i had the whole connection. Family connections in melbourne. And. And relationships and that sort of thing.

251
00:31:17,53 --> 00:31:25,65
It was all. Phantom album. And then i came up here to develop. The ideas in this sort of social.

252
00:31:25,65 --> 00:31:29,44
Experimental you know get together which can even.
