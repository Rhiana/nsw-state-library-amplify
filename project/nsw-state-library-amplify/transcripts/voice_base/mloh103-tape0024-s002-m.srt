1
00:00:14,56 --> 00:00:17,02
So i came back.

2
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:24,74
What ryan doesn't write me a letter saying come out for this festival here in the september festival which he was

3
00:00:24,74 --> 00:00:31,7
organizing. And do things with the kids because it was a lot of stuff going on with it because children born and.

4
00:00:31,7 --> 00:00:36,8
Growing up and so it was a lot of children activity in the community. In the water community.

5
00:00:36,8 --> 00:00:45,09
That's all of us sort of the alternative. And quite sort of. Sane. So we had a. Interconnectedness and.

6
00:00:45,09 --> 00:00:53,43
And still doing you know social interacting you know experimenting. And he came up with the idea of.

7
00:00:54,34 --> 00:01:00,64
Well he had all these pint and he said look at all these pipe nobody wants a pipe the fast is right.

8
00:01:00,64 --> 00:01:09,26
I said oh well just look that is not all ideas of. You know i seen bubbles drifting across the roofs and i said.

9
00:01:09,26 --> 00:01:15,08
Oh yeah. Yeah right. You know because i've never done i've never done yours before they were just on campuses.

10
00:01:15,08 --> 00:01:23,51
But they got but i knew i could do it because of what he'd done things a lot skyll i did things. Anyway.

11
00:01:23,51 --> 00:01:26,11
Now and believe that. And i said.

12
00:01:26,11 --> 00:01:33,07
For him but and also we didn't know any daddy places that i started off with was the places that were already.

13
00:01:33,07 --> 00:01:37,05
Alternative. But i did it. I decided to do it. Really well and.

14
00:01:37,05 --> 00:01:40,55
Try and get everybody sort of the bad joining up the whole.

15
00:01:40,55 --> 00:01:45,9
Do you not the town so did it doesn't exercise the you're not the town. Usually.

16
00:01:45,9 --> 00:01:49,67
And i sort of put a lot of energy i was a little soft again because i thought oh.

17
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:59,67
Because i thought in terms of whether it's the outrage the global outreach the whole. If thoughts behind.

18
00:01:59,67 --> 00:02:04,61
Connecting up i know this is so idealist i was mad idealist.

19
00:02:04,61 --> 00:02:04,98
And it's

20
00:02:04,98 --> 00:02:11,73
and it's not i don't see myself as a mad ideals i see that we are connected even though people's seanad of action

21
00:02:11,73 --> 00:02:13,67
reaction and. We affect things.

22
00:02:14,13 --> 00:02:21,98
We live on a planet earth which is a living thing in a keeps us alive and we've got to interact with it. And whatever.

23
00:02:21,98 --> 00:02:29,05
And one another to keep it alive. And hopefully it'll get around to that awareness alive are getting.

24
00:02:29,05 --> 00:02:37,33
And so i just got this. You know i had this idea of society. In terms of different.

25
00:02:37,33 --> 00:02:42,34
You know we drift and we come together and we drift apart and you know. This is the house.

26
00:02:42,34 --> 00:02:48,66
How things are and the universe in hundreds. Concept of the universe in terms of of imagery.

27
00:02:48,66 --> 00:02:55,38
Of these orbs that float around because as to how the solar system looks to me there was more information on this.

28
00:02:55,38 --> 00:02:56,18
Just sort of that.

29
00:02:56,18 --> 00:03:01,8
And that's that space that's so developing that same idea did in the early stages i thought this is a great way to do

30
00:03:01,8 --> 00:03:07,87
it sort of having shaped cameras as i do it over the. Facets of to really work the idea.

31
00:03:07,87 --> 00:03:15,43
And i want to go an opportunity so i just put a lot of energy into just going from and and.

32
00:03:15,43 --> 00:03:21,65
Getting these ideas and i did have quite a few i ended up actually doing a whole straight strip.

33
00:03:21,65 --> 00:03:27,36
From one in the town right to the other with that all well with not just with the bubbles drifting

34
00:03:27,36 --> 00:03:33,04
and sort of move from the bubbles in a i've typed it off with the bubbles going off in the fly over the importing which

35
00:03:33,04 --> 00:03:38,00
doesn't exist now. And then i went out to the rainforest and then on to a quiet.

36
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:43,3
Meditation on to the healing center where they were to sort of came off there.

37
00:03:43,3 --> 00:03:49,00
Just thinking about it and of people letting me do it because they'd. Because i said oh it looks good you know.

38
00:03:49,00 --> 00:03:50,79
They got into the concept.

39
00:03:50,79 --> 00:03:56,03
And what at first it was resistance because it was resistance to some of the people they had

40
00:03:56,03 --> 00:03:59,24
but sort of one of my over by saying what you get into it.

41
00:03:59,24 --> 00:04:05,28
To be part of i did a whole thing on the news i just was the hardest. One because that's was like.

42
00:04:05,28 --> 00:04:15,19
The national party sort of support is there. I ran the news agency and. But. I talked to the. The woman there sort of.

43
00:04:15,19 --> 00:04:22,44
You concept of the taking of having a picture. You know. Up then doing the sunglasses and. All the way to body.

44
00:04:22,44 --> 00:04:26,53
You know happy family. And i had them right up the front. You know right you know.

45
00:04:26,53 --> 00:04:30,79
And i saw right and i thought it was interesting i looked at the quality of words i knew

46
00:04:30,79 --> 00:04:36,33
and how it was the whole place to pretty shoddy up to that the cut of paint would have done it good anyway.

47
00:04:36,33 --> 00:04:44,6
So that's out got away with it actually because the nobody was really doing anything up there. And.

48
00:04:44,6 --> 00:04:48,38
And it was nothing much it was.

49
00:04:48,38 --> 00:04:53,09
You know it's at least i'm giving it a kind of pride and you showed him the idea

50
00:04:53,09 --> 00:04:59,55
and the idea didn't look terribly controversial because it will be interesting to see.

51
00:04:59,55 --> 00:05:07,86
It's always different styles are just sort of developed. I just went along and just.

52
00:05:07,86 --> 00:05:17,86
Tart it up my style basically i worked on. A very simple style. Which was hard it's flat. Color. So all.

53
00:05:17,86 --> 00:05:26,76
Even the three d. Effect was created by. You know. Two tone. To turn a fix. So it's just flat color there's no shading.

54
00:05:26,76 --> 00:05:31,62
It's just actually just flat color. But i mix the colors and i got. So i worked off that.

55
00:05:31,62 --> 00:05:40,23
And it was an easy way to design. So when i get it up. I knew where the. Where the areas of the painting.

56
00:05:40,23 --> 00:05:43,53
So i was just. Was it was a matter of painting areas.

57
00:05:43,53 --> 00:05:49,34
And then you could put in shading another six to work so it was a big job so it kept it is minimal and is easy

58
00:05:49,34 --> 00:06:00,07
and other people can help to paint. In that sort of. Say just feeling. Areas of color. From design.

59
00:06:00,07 --> 00:06:05,99
Well because i have a two year period of that sort of. That that. That strip of.

60
00:06:05,99 --> 00:06:13,67
Of activity of sort of stream of activity that i went overseas. To look at public out in other places.

61
00:06:14,26 --> 00:06:28,95
And you noticed i was actually. Yeah well that actually developed after that when i after finished the mural.

62
00:06:28,95 --> 00:06:33,72
There's a dollar man here that's another. That's a character that developed.

63
00:06:35,4 --> 00:06:40,65
Well actually i'll finish up with this any bubbles because that whole concept was all part of a total concept.

64
00:06:40,65 --> 00:06:49,64
And zanny bubbles actually had i was sort of appearing disappear was sort of. And become a ritual became a ritual.

65
00:06:49,64 --> 00:06:58,6
Perform. Are used in enriching perform i got this as a as a ritual. Leader. A ritual scene a pace or ritual sharman.

66
00:06:58,6 --> 00:07:10,74
And where we did it so i did a series of solstice of into the seasons and. And so. Related to that sort of circular.

67
00:07:10,74 --> 00:07:17,52
And spatial relationship or the other thing here for fire.

68
00:07:17,52 --> 00:07:25,71
Rituals with the community and so was the concentric circles. Of twelve. Balls of fire.

69
00:07:25,71 --> 00:07:30,99
Things like that but i use that that caution became. Of became more than just that it had a cape.

70
00:07:30,99 --> 00:07:34,87
And i did all this illusionary stuff so i developed a whole. Dance theater.

71
00:07:35,12 --> 00:07:39,2
I could do on my own from a injury a little and doing workshops and just doing.

72
00:07:39,2 --> 00:07:43,29
Just dancing with people and developing more vocabulary of movement.

73
00:07:43,29 --> 00:07:50,79
With people over carefully in relating to community dancing. And into rectory and contact and. All that sort of.

74
00:07:50,79 --> 00:08:01,64
The you know this. Developing. You know. Developing processes in. You know our sensory bodily interactions.

75
00:08:01,64 --> 00:08:07,98
And movement. You know ourselves individually. So that was part of that. That was sort of a yogi thing mother had this.

76
00:08:07,98 --> 00:08:13,67
Turtle thing which had spots and i was a focus on the take it out any way i could do these events and expressed my.

77
00:08:13,93 --> 00:08:25,93
Something mind you know. With that. I just use it as a as a springboard to express ideas. And so of good ideas i feel.

78
00:08:25,93 --> 00:08:32,86
It was part of that of. The attention getting attention. And then.

79
00:08:32,86 --> 00:08:36,99
Well don lemon grew out of after that sort of that sort of.

80
00:08:36,99 --> 00:08:44,61
Oh well it was very much involved with healing a process as well. Dance my dance in the movement i was very much.

81
00:08:44,61 --> 00:08:48,5
Became part of my as a healer. In the community.

82
00:08:48,5 --> 00:08:53,64
And that was this whole process of aquarius was developing those skills for healing in actual fact.

83
00:08:54,18 --> 00:09:06,17
And so the community getting together was healing. And. Well traveled overseas with and and.

84
00:09:06,17 --> 00:09:12,12
And my first stop was in los angeles at the world symposium on humanities which johnny allen said.

85
00:09:12,12 --> 00:09:27,97
Attend this is important and vent. And it was that was of the thinkers around the world..

86
00:09:18,94 --> 00:09:27,79
Congregating in different areas around the world. It was the. There was this. The pasadena center was in l.

87
00:09:27,97 --> 00:09:31,04
You know ally and there was the.

88
00:09:31,04 --> 00:09:39,74
The stadium wimbley stadium in in england there was another thing and i was in toronto. Trying to university.

89
00:09:39,74 --> 00:09:50,74
And i had to move around because there was government so they were freaking out towards the end because it looked like.

90
00:09:44,95 --> 00:09:51,61
because it was really challenging the status quo because there was i had a t.v. Link up.

91
00:09:51,61 --> 00:09:57,43
I was going to go on all around. This. And that's when such a lot started to happen satellite t.v.

92
00:09:57,43 --> 00:10:03,18
and I was booked satellite t.v. To be. To link into. Networks around the world about this conference.

93
00:10:03,18 --> 00:10:09,98
And of course governments pull the plug on them. All over this whole thing was sabotaged by governments the actual.

94
00:10:09,98 --> 00:10:13,67
You know the video and interop that i try to do that.

95
00:10:13,84 --> 00:10:19,76
They moved in officials moved in to try and close close down the university there.

96
00:10:19,76 --> 00:10:24,82
And the allied one got off with a lot of difficulty. The wimberley stadium one.

97
00:10:24,82 --> 00:10:27,18
Just got off i don't know they had problems so was the last

98
00:10:27,18 --> 00:10:31,71
and last minute they got a gun because there were problems with. Management the government.

99
00:10:31,71 --> 00:10:38,77
Pulled out was that she was in and she was creating. You know sort of within down the line.

100
00:10:38,77 --> 00:10:43,66
You know why the well supervision was really discussing all these things we're talking about this is the military

101
00:10:43,66 --> 00:10:49,66
complex and the problems in the health and healing in the indigenous peoples.

102
00:10:49,66 --> 00:10:57,96
All these things that really light and to die. That's becoming more and more. You know. You know. Becoming mainstream.

103
00:10:57,96 --> 00:10:59,17
What is my stream now.

104
00:10:59,17 --> 00:11:06,67
That discussion this is the way to go a lot to heal the wounds with with the people that were in this country that work

105
00:11:06,67 --> 00:11:14,6
force or force boy. Military culture. And so imperialist cultures and all that and.

106
00:11:14,6 --> 00:11:19,14
From and the whole culture that was here with us we lighted and. Connected with the earth.

107
00:11:19,14 --> 00:11:24,1
And this awareness was sort of becoming more among people that.

108
00:11:24,1 --> 00:11:30,89
Congregating least spots around the place and the healing and. So i was like the aquarius festival. Ten years after.

109
00:11:30,89 --> 00:11:36,01
But now held in as coffins forums. We think is. Without.

110
00:11:36,01 --> 00:11:42,3
And we had the music gets tight place and the for ritual that was held in a sort of. You know try to be a mainstream.

111
00:11:42,3 --> 00:11:47,52
Event. Was a mainstream a very. And so that. Government people and.

112
00:11:47,52 --> 00:11:52,32
People the ministry rather than the city people have in the field doing it.

113
00:11:52,32 --> 00:11:56,16
And using computers and technology using all of sort of.

114
00:11:56,16 --> 00:12:00,7
You know that state of the asked sort of technology it was a viable.

115
00:12:00,7 --> 00:12:04,97
It's come on the saints i was the age of personal computers.

116
00:12:04,97 --> 00:12:13,67
And just just came on the scene the in there was in haiti nine seventy nine sorry seventy nine was the.

117
00:12:14,95 --> 00:12:20,23
Just before the ickes. And i saw the guy twenty i.d.'s. And i was listening.

118
00:12:20,23 --> 00:12:25,34
This year that we've just gone through with viet nam and it was just and also the.

119
00:12:25,34 --> 00:12:32,89
Nuclear power station in three more along and just blew up a well. Nearly blew up you know so. It was that.

120
00:12:32,89 --> 00:12:39,76
And so there was a big movement towards having this. This these forums.

121
00:12:41,28 --> 00:12:50,16
And so it was to help people similar and i was there was a lot of learning. On my connection with policy larry.

122
00:12:50,16 --> 00:12:55,17
Santee and that's whole the whole idea of. Perma culture. City.

123
00:12:55,17 --> 00:13:01,62
Which he had going then it's a call and i call it cheap prices. So i moved on from frank lloyd wright.

124
00:13:01,62 --> 00:13:07,55
That's another story. And that. And and.

125
00:13:07,55 --> 00:13:13,75
I then took part and then the whole nuclear issue became i became aware helen call it cut was. It was there.

126
00:13:13,75 --> 00:13:20,57
And there was ralph nader. And i spoke to ralph nader. After one of his talks and he said.

127
00:13:20,57 --> 00:13:24,17
Well the best way you can get in touch with people is one to one.

128
00:13:24,17 --> 00:13:29,75
He said talked about all these electronic sin this and that is greit. He said as one to one so.

129
00:13:29,75 --> 00:13:35,79
That's stuck in my mind and. He's right stuck in my he does talk and i will. I pick up the types from.

130
00:13:35,79 --> 00:13:41,88
What was taking place there. And then the nuclear issue was when i got back to a stright avenue q she was.

131
00:13:41,88 --> 00:13:43,13
Was a big issue.

132
00:13:43,13 --> 00:13:49,68
And the aboriginal issue with a lot of things have been america i want to go on this because the whole story in itself

133
00:13:49,68 --> 00:13:54,46
my journey through the whole public. I was involved with the with. No nukes.

134
00:13:56,21 --> 00:14:03,5
No nukes evading three malar not at in new york new york was a whole month of alternative energy.

135
00:14:03,5 --> 00:14:04,86
It was quite progressive.

136
00:14:04,86 --> 00:14:12,07
Like there was an electric buses going around to alternative things that are happening in new york city.

137
00:14:12,07 --> 00:14:17,95
And i was going on and then there was a whole. Plan of action. When you with. The no nukes concerts.

138
00:14:17,95 --> 00:14:25,82
On took place on the. Which was recorded with all these. Stassen there's a whole movement from hollywood.

139
00:14:25,82 --> 00:14:29,53
And around the country coming to new york was sort of. On the road.

140
00:14:29,53 --> 00:14:34,98
Journey and they came to new york with this big mouth of it. Amounts of events.

141
00:14:34,98 --> 00:14:42,19
And that whole technological fare of alternatives. To direct action.

142
00:14:42,53 --> 00:14:49,34
And then there was you know stopping wall street and and. Getting in touch with all the new groups the weapon.

143
00:14:49,34 --> 00:14:55,88
Groups and all that sort the whole thing was the whole link of. The nuclear power. Meeting with the weapons industry.

144
00:14:55,88 --> 00:15:01,7
And how it's. It's really dangerous. You know. Really bad news.

145
00:15:01,7 --> 00:15:08,64
That alone it's the cold war it's creating real real problems. It's just the whole military industry.

146
00:15:08,64 --> 00:15:17,57
And this was going out the whole madness. That we need. Pace and. Not war and you call up nuclear and.

147
00:15:17,57 --> 00:15:21,92
Nuclear stuff was showing its evil rearing its nuclear head with the three mall an accident.

148
00:15:22,4 --> 00:15:28,64
I got a lot of people on the road anyway. So i decided to be part of that. To help with that.

149
00:15:28,64 --> 00:15:31,15
I didn't have the doorman there.

150
00:15:31,15 --> 00:15:37,53
There was sort of happening later on because at that stage i was just they helping or just giving out leaflets and.

151
00:15:37,53 --> 00:15:46,4
I was there was a visitor. I want to came back to australia. There was new combat. And so i was with a sort of help.

152
00:15:46,4 --> 00:15:50,88
Help that i did a flag for. Big aboriginal flag that was up.

153
00:15:50,88 --> 00:15:58,45
Get there was no i mean i he at some paws cathedral so i was there and i had the workshops.

154
00:15:58,45 --> 00:16:04,06
Develop us there was one dance. I was involved dance all the time. Dance and murals.

155
00:16:04,06 --> 00:16:10,52
The whole concert with the bubble still developing. You know with planet earth now going into the pub will. Think.

156
00:16:10,52 --> 00:16:12,71
Who are still developing it and.

157
00:16:14,77 --> 00:16:23,46
So the so then after new combine after that one you know it was direct action and straight.

158
00:16:23,46 --> 00:16:31,28
Event and also observe street theater. You know america. And. And i had in my mind implanted. Certain images.

159
00:16:34,61 --> 00:16:40,82
So i didn't know where i was going there because it all still was into dance and murals

160
00:16:40,82 --> 00:16:46,48
and healing is a really important thing did like the way it was going was really good like that positive.

161
00:16:46,48 --> 00:16:53,00
But it sort of started to dawn on me with. How well i was first of mobs observational direct action on wall street.

162
00:16:53,00 --> 00:16:55,19
That wall street action and. Sort of.

163
00:16:55,19 --> 00:17:02,71
Fifty years since wall street collapse i tried to create the same scenario over with

164
00:17:02,71 --> 00:17:10,43
and you can just stop whole street to stop wall street i have to hold you clean the streets and do no nukes.

165
00:17:10,43 --> 00:17:16,03
And i came back a couple story short. Came back. And i was heard.

166
00:17:16,03 --> 00:17:22,79
Often you can by heard about the little head and it was a healing festival and that and salsas and that.

167
00:17:23,35 --> 00:17:31,44
I was into rituals and. And healing and so forth but. When i got got there.

168
00:17:31,44 --> 00:17:35,33
I heard a story that the ball does what coming in any mean any take of a clock.

169
00:17:35,33 --> 00:17:40,82
To clear these beautiful beats you know. And people meditating and doing you're going to have a strong.

170
00:17:40,82 --> 00:17:49,05
You know what a great importance the aboriginal people. Middle here. And to ryan you just have and the before.

171
00:17:49,05 --> 00:17:54,59
And i was connected with the terrain you and your from. Corresponds i was that the no nukes concerts well.

172
00:17:54,59 --> 00:18:00,52
To run you what's happening as i did was following us around yeah. So i was keyed into that sort of movement.

173
00:18:02,32 --> 00:18:12,79
But you know i haven't been arrested before this was my first arrest of all situation i found like a real head and.

174
00:18:12,79 --> 00:18:16,95
There. I really started out and i was sort of like i was.

175
00:18:16,95 --> 00:18:22,31
I was really got to me i just start saying machinery's as monsters.

176
00:18:22,31 --> 00:18:29,41
And actually got to made by an order is beautiful people and your thirty's and how we oscillate it.

177
00:18:29,41 --> 00:18:35,00
The media slanting that was going on. You know miking us were a bunch of terrorists or how was this whole.

178
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:42,19
People occupying. An area. And asking questions that hey you know hold it and. You know this.

179
00:18:42,19 --> 00:18:47,82
Let's not sort of devastate this beautiful area this is very rare. Nothing.

180
00:18:47,82 --> 00:18:54,00
And of course we'll put in a position where we had were pitted against these machines and.

181
00:18:54,00 --> 00:18:55,22
The operators of the machines

182
00:18:55,22 --> 00:19:00,76
and the machine for goods are could see these things i would to a long stint of meditation.

183
00:19:03,35 --> 00:19:10,83
After that why i like the first sortie. Well. It was the first sortie. And then i got arrested in that sortie.

184
00:19:10,83 --> 00:19:16,68
Of the forest because of a sort of hide of the trees girl we have is some of the very sensitive to the treason.

185
00:19:17,14 --> 00:19:20,61
Because singing to me. And i'm going to have these so i was.

186
00:19:20,61 --> 00:19:25,76
Something something was going on you know that i want to was but i could hear voices

187
00:19:25,76 --> 00:19:29,79
and things i was sort of spot on i could see the.

188
00:19:29,79 --> 00:19:36,32
Because i did a lot of meditation and yoga and that's that i'm developing that song. And all of a sudden. This sort of.

189
00:19:36,32 --> 00:19:41,86
Other thing was coming to me it is no answer i mean i'm not into sort of. Saying that god spoke to me.

190
00:19:41,86 --> 00:19:47,96
But i was something like that and it's sort of like over such as hearing that crying out there is something you know.

191
00:19:47,96 --> 00:19:52,81
And. And the birds and. You will and. Dead birds on the ground and.

192
00:19:52,81 --> 00:19:58,59
The whole night you was in disarray i could see it i was sitting among it. And we were in there.

193
00:19:58,59 --> 00:20:00,93
And a lot of magic was a lot of magic with the people there

194
00:20:00,93 --> 00:20:05,07
and i mean it was a certain feeling a certain things were happening manifesting in you.

195
00:20:05,07 --> 00:20:07,36
You just felt there was a certain strength.

196
00:20:07,36 --> 00:20:13,67
Even though wolf you were very strong and very powerful people in the bernabeu. Coming up and. And you know we had.

197
00:20:14,12 --> 00:20:20,13
Indigenous people and that was very special because i was becoming aware of the indigenous culture and.

198
00:20:20,13 --> 00:20:27,26
And how you know listen to them and when they come from the primal roots they actually didn't people of. Primal roots.

199
00:20:27,26 --> 00:20:28,79
Go right back of.

200
00:20:28,79 --> 00:20:32,78
Before we became inventors of and trying to think we are god

201
00:20:32,78 --> 00:20:38,57
and change the world that we're actually part of nature who are living with nature back in those days no civilization

202
00:20:38,57 --> 00:20:43,32
driven so i was aware of that sort of connection and

203
00:20:43,32 --> 00:20:49,2
and everything the people of this just every general awareness from that new can by our actions.

204
00:20:49,2 --> 00:20:52,72
Was there and then it was. When you rick it's coming up.

205
00:20:53,29 --> 00:20:56,97
And again graham danson sort of flew and said graeme that and actually had a great influence.

206
00:20:58,05 --> 00:21:05,24
I mean a lot of people have a lot of flak on him but actually he's not here i've got a more here. That's.

207
00:21:05,24 --> 00:21:08,00
Because the after effect he sort of triggered me off.

208
00:21:08,00 --> 00:21:13,78
Another one i mean you'll also you know he sort of triggered of ego type things as well lucky so where did things it

209
00:21:13,78 --> 00:21:17,07
was a good critic i mean he's a critic. You know.

210
00:21:17,07 --> 00:21:18,83
Rights and critics and he stirs up stuff

211
00:21:18,83 --> 00:21:26,76
but he's good because he stirs up this stuff to really bring out the real issues. You know question of you know.

212
00:21:26,76 --> 00:21:27,83
And for change.

213
00:21:29,53 --> 00:21:32,89
So member on the big show was wondering so what are you going to do

214
00:21:32,89 --> 00:21:39,03
but if i say there's all this is happening because i wasn't prepared for us i was still into this thing.

215
00:21:39,03 --> 00:21:48,43
You know i said doing yoga meditation doing circles. You know. All these things are sort of appeasing people sort of.

216
00:21:48,43 --> 00:21:54,66
You know sort of crawling. To say how you know it is that this is the way you guys know it's not so nice seeing up.

217
00:21:54,66 --> 00:22:01,18
We're actually dealing with an evil situation a situation or. People don't want to change fear and well you know.

218
00:22:01,18 --> 00:22:07,93
They try. Intransient. That's it and. And i'll just go through what i want to listen to anything else.

219
00:22:07,93 --> 00:22:14,42
I want to say to that side of it. So i want to shock i mean you know i mean. We needed to do some. Dramatic.

220
00:22:14,42 --> 00:22:20,21
You know i just have to say i'll sit in meditation you know what to do i didn't like to see really try to sort of.

221
00:22:20,21 --> 00:22:27,18
I don't know what to do. At that so when the and then a so we were set up with a recycling fee at the top idea to do.

222
00:22:27,18 --> 00:22:33,37
Actions. In precaution i just came out of jail. And we want to laugh to get back into the area.

223
00:22:33,37 --> 00:22:34,38
And so we were actually.

224
00:22:34,38 --> 00:22:38,63
We would be in court we would've been in trouble so i was always sort of come together in a kind of the concept.

225
00:22:38,63 --> 00:22:39,5
We put on mosques

226
00:22:39,5 --> 00:22:44,68
and we did these actions where we had mass i would know who we work because if they were being identified we would have

227
00:22:44,68 --> 00:22:45,73
been arrested.

228
00:22:46,27 --> 00:22:52,98
So so so we might mosques and seems like a credit to a recycling camp after crime and so

229
00:22:52,98 --> 00:22:59,7
when you going to decide to do that and going to bed and was talking about doing this and all idea of doing a crucifix.

230
00:23:00,45 --> 00:23:03,24
You know i'd like to sort of a crucifix idea of.

231
00:23:03,24 --> 00:23:09,07
Because we only had one way of going to the bache and all the rest was farson. Ogata by police on a white down.

232
00:23:09,07 --> 00:23:13,98
So we sort of created it into that the police pain the the sense. Syrians and.

233
00:23:13,98 --> 00:23:18,9
We set up these crosses and one was it was different was. We had three crosses one.

234
00:23:18,9 --> 00:23:27,29
One was for a woman was a woman on a header. And then one was a hippie and i was aboriginal so we had that sort of.

235
00:23:27,29 --> 00:23:29,46
As a christopher i and i were all.

236
00:23:29,46 --> 00:23:34,22
Built out of the at these cruises we might out of the trees that were white light

237
00:23:34,22 --> 00:23:38,92
and we did this as a one of the actions or memon we sank down by where i was a whole production

238
00:23:38,92 --> 00:23:49,43
and was filmed by boy by d.c. Id say guy am. With his and i'm perfect fit in these nine.

239
00:23:49,55 --> 00:23:55,07
But he filmed it because no media would turn up he was a person they were super right and need to film that.

240
00:23:55,07 --> 00:24:01,98
I remember that action it was really significant. So i set up that camp. To help. And just the this project.

241
00:24:01,98 --> 00:24:05,89
Started it all came together all at once. My guess is this group mind.

242
00:24:05,89 --> 00:24:11,92
It was an aboriginal name to see their two at the dam to see from camera move to middle head.

243
00:24:12,23 --> 00:24:16,68
So the actual that they were. Awful something have but i moved to middle here.

244
00:24:16,68 --> 00:24:22,61
Now didn't see the kick of the just a move to middle head. He saw it. But i know what happened there. Forget.

245
00:24:22,61 --> 00:24:30,46
That i me to mill him. So that there. While in that meditation i had this. Scalpels and.

246
00:24:30,46 --> 00:24:34,14
You know these things came up in and. So and the greed.

247
00:24:35,42 --> 00:24:39,11
And sort of like is a bad greed you know i saw these monsters

248
00:24:39,11 --> 00:24:45,49
and i sort of agree does their own company is a bad grade and that sort of just hit on to me to saudi and of the does.

249
00:24:45,49 --> 00:24:52,38
And the great author does a concept of pull together. Of great guys and coming so. Out of recycled plastic.

250
00:24:52,38 --> 00:25:01,36
And and and cardboard. My greed doesn't come and so i was the first started i was the first stage of that development.

251
00:25:01,36 --> 00:25:06,37
And then. You know that fell apart undeveloped a bit. With piper mashing a crew and then.

252
00:25:06,37 --> 00:25:10,59
As i went they ran actions are developed at caution as part of doing banners and flags

253
00:25:10,59 --> 00:25:14,49
and all the rest of it for actions of development theater pacing

254
00:25:14,49 --> 00:25:21,79
and expression which would be a sort of the shortest ghost. Will appear because we will go doing ghost actions.

255
00:25:21,79 --> 00:25:27,47
With a sort of dark at night would come in and sort of move in and do the sort of.

256
00:25:27,47 --> 00:25:36,95
You know do actions with their costumes sort of an idea and. I was anger. Involved with it at the time.

257
00:25:36,95 --> 00:25:44,18
And now it's changed and i would not anger but actually sort of even developed. As i developed it became sort of.

258
00:25:44,18 --> 00:25:47,81
I mean there's anger buts and that sort of flight.

259
00:25:47,81 --> 00:25:52,54
High catch you see what it's a bad thing we wanted to sort of just get into changing you know.

260
00:25:52,54 --> 00:25:59,95
So that sort of thing is all these are mice mixed reactions go on. But it's. That's not sort of i aim to.

261
00:25:59,95 --> 00:26:06,4
Just slam but it's actually it's sort of to help with enlargement. And martin people for changes.

262
00:26:06,4 --> 00:26:11,00
And so taken around and it's sort of the media pick up on it really well.

263
00:26:11,00 --> 00:26:16,68
I don't connect because i'm really good on a good and good for. Projecting more body.

264
00:26:16,68 --> 00:26:27,09
With the images in whole you know i just i just practiced. Rehearsal every time i do it is another rehearsal.

265
00:26:27,09 --> 00:26:35,21
In a movement. Yeah. So i developed at develop that it was a deliberate development an arc on without us.

266
00:26:35,21 --> 00:26:39,69
Spelling it out just doing it you know just such a strong myself into the into the.

267
00:26:39,69 --> 00:26:45,64
You know help create the theater and then i'm just at that little place myself like. Everything set up in the woods.

268
00:26:46,57 --> 00:26:54,88
To my number. And when i get a rest. I use that as part of the theory like. And just play with the with.

269
00:26:54,88 --> 00:27:01,43
Everything around me to create. Just so that when the. When the where the shot the guy is that sort of.

270
00:27:01,43 --> 00:27:08,59
You get after that. He got these totally images. And they can use it. And just hope the media will use it.

271
00:27:08,59 --> 00:27:12,37
And some do it some don't do it depends and some.

272
00:27:12,37 --> 00:27:17,1
Distorted it i'm going to sing a sing the whole sort of monkey business that goes on with the media different media as

273
00:27:17,1 --> 00:27:23,97
you know some. Distorted. Where they totally were totally ignored it. Or they turned it into something totally.

274
00:27:23,97 --> 00:27:32,96
I did you know. Everybody has their into a totally dark rather than give the full spirit you know what. Really years.

275
00:27:32,96 --> 00:27:39,46
But in others. I was using it but every time i put it in there. It was a plus. Like media is a plus.

276
00:27:39,46 --> 00:27:46,53
Even if they give you bad as to made bad media you still made. I mean it actually rising.

277
00:27:46,53 --> 00:27:53,13
People are being raised about the issue. I mean even i can cause what i. We law and i like. You know these dirty and.

278
00:27:53,13 --> 00:28:00,49
Came. Poor and dull bludging whatever. It's still the issue was about a forest.

279
00:28:00,49 --> 00:28:08,68
Disappearing and toxic weiss going into the system. You know these things and if they really people want to and.

280
00:28:08,68 --> 00:28:14,79
Really want to one of these people on a bad. You know they come up and people come to the. People to come up.

281
00:28:15,21 --> 00:28:21,78
I find out even the journalists that turn up. They get they get mad. They get an earful of what. What we're there.

282
00:28:21,78 --> 00:28:27,51
If they'd. Rejected it. You know on the cutting on the cutting board and then when the cutting.

283
00:28:27,51 --> 00:28:33,24
Wherever it is you know in the editing. Stages. It's you know. On the policy where over the years.

284
00:28:33,24 --> 00:28:39,19
They still got the information that might its way into guys and to the politicians. He said all the lit.

285
00:28:39,19 --> 00:28:42,21
They get it if they listen or not they're getting the information.

286
00:28:42,21 --> 00:28:48,88
So it's been a really good tool to me that direct action. Or ice. Is still good because it does it.

287
00:28:48,88 --> 00:28:54,97
It's sort of you grab them when i say oh well you know i would just listen to them

288
00:28:54,97 --> 00:28:59,79
but with business as usual sort of thing. So they're just sort of holding to ransom.

289
00:28:59,79 --> 00:29:03,82
You know nonviolent to wreck so the other thing is doing nonviolent direct their action.

290
00:29:03,82 --> 00:29:13,87
And that whole development of nonviolent direct action. Of doing things. To make people aware. Without. You know. With.

291
00:29:13,87 --> 00:29:20,97
Without going to war over it. You know. So it was it was an exercise in that itself like the theatrical.

292
00:29:20,97 --> 00:29:38,2
Of theater direct action and. Theater. And the reporting itself an arrestable situations. So the fear bice.

293
00:29:38,2 --> 00:29:45,7
Well i would. Yeah. I observe. I observe people's. Expressions of us and. I mean every time i there.

294
00:29:45,7 --> 00:29:53,55
And i listen to table. And the feedback is a lot of peoples within the movement say.

295
00:29:53,55 --> 00:29:59,86
It's great because it got me involved. A lot of people. I sort of helped a lot of people to be in.

296
00:29:59,86 --> 00:30:03,39
It was a sort of source i placed on the guilt of people like you say.
