1
00:00:10,41 --> 00:00:44,06
So i am still a fast made. All of the cake. And jack. Join all of them. In my. Oh. I on sale of the gate and.

2
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:51,72
I think into the saying. I was born a year. About a year after.

3
00:00:51,72 --> 00:01:02,34
My parents john oliver and john gave me the name infancy need. I was their first child. And i lived on.

4
00:01:02,34 --> 00:01:12,07
Paradise valley. To their economy in the stead of nimbin and to was about full time until i was about eight. I think.

5
00:01:12,07 --> 00:01:20,3
And my dad made it into lee's mill. And i decided to live with him and visit. Mom.

6
00:01:20,3 --> 00:01:32,8
Have you want to put a guy who paid a good shot. On weekends and. That's when i cam john on my feet in basically.

7
00:01:32,8 --> 00:01:41,03
I was one of the first time. Also a few years later around two years after my sister. I was numb the.

8
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:51,79
Number seven baby born on the community. First and first buried behind in the community. I see i live.

9
00:01:51,79 --> 00:02:03,45
Two hours about i. Way out of my mother. On new follow that stage moved down here to bar by just. Nearby.

10
00:02:03,45 --> 00:02:18,11
Dr i she was photonic to about the age of eight. Earliest memories of. Would have on the community.

11
00:02:18,11 --> 00:02:26,46
With a wide range of friends. Just as. My memory is just one big happy family. I see only.

12
00:02:26,46 --> 00:02:34,01
There was no major mother figure major father figure. Everyone to turn to anyone for any help. Anything.

13
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:36,79
You know i was a big happy family.

14
00:02:38,49 --> 00:02:40,1
Well i have a lot of memories

15
00:02:40,1 --> 00:02:46,34
and i actually been thinking about it because people say oh my first memory is of my mom doing useless and i that.

16
00:02:46,34 --> 00:02:56,51
I don't really know exactly what. All my memories fit in. And i that. Tonka toys. I don't actually.

17
00:02:56,51 --> 00:03:02,12
Let's really talk about these big family thing i don't really remember a lot of the parents like parents always there

18
00:03:02,12 --> 00:03:06,9
were navy nay them. But they went to be part of my life and i probably would but honest.

19
00:03:06,9 --> 00:03:09,65
Members and i'm basically a member

20
00:03:09,65 --> 00:03:15,21
or a group of friends like there was jamie entirely in all these people who are older than me

21
00:03:15,21 --> 00:03:18,7
and then there was a group of friends who in my eyes and those those who are younger than us

22
00:03:18,7 --> 00:03:23,49
and of those this one particular place where used. All the older.

23
00:03:23,49 --> 00:03:28,6
The older guys had tonka toys and we'd make tonka toy cities in.

24
00:03:28,6 --> 00:03:32,67
Mud really just i mean just having so much fun in the outdoors like.

25
00:03:32,67 --> 00:03:37,34
I don't know if i ever had a lot of toys but artist noise that.

26
00:03:37,34 --> 00:03:40,74
I didn't have to have something material in my hands i mean.

27
00:03:40,74 --> 00:03:45,36
Yeah i could just go outside and we might mud pies and bring them into mom

28
00:03:45,36 --> 00:03:49,97
and she'd go being being being cooked i mean you have and then we get side and eat them so i have to say.

29
00:03:49,97 --> 00:03:59,15
The airways memories are just of. Having a whole lot of fun. Just. With these group of friends. Like children and.

30
00:03:59,15 --> 00:04:09,55
I mean there were adult. Influences but basically just the kids. Having so much fun. Would have to be you know i yeah.

31
00:04:11,15 --> 00:04:22,81
Bush experience. A lot of exploring. Too i think two hundred ten eyck of. Anyway.

32
00:04:22,81 --> 00:04:27,74
Quite a large farm for small kids to explore. And so you know.

33
00:04:27,74 --> 00:04:34,52
There's there's a great waterfall there with the big swimming how much bicycling the community lived around in the

34
00:04:34,52 --> 00:04:43,04
summer. You know to swim everyday and those. Some with lots of kids our age older and younger sally mentioned so.

35
00:04:43,04 --> 00:04:46,85
They used to be a lot of tricks off into the bush just by ourselves.

36
00:04:46,85 --> 00:04:51,89
You know like that we had the freedom to do that didn't have to be supervised. You know.

37
00:04:51,89 --> 00:04:58,65
We didn't have supervision i was just paper joined. But you know i would head off into the bush and.

38
00:04:58,65 --> 00:05:07,4
Those are lots of experience with the bush and. You know a lot of animals on the phone a lot of fun with that.

39
00:05:10,27 --> 00:05:13,41
Now i've lived in. Cycle suburbia i guess.

40
00:05:13,41 --> 00:05:20,42
Is what most people want to hear when i say the bush experiences things like. It's really.

41
00:05:20,42 --> 00:05:26,07
At one stage we did have i mean we always had sam i've never been seven. Living with dad.

42
00:05:26,07 --> 00:05:31,48
Every house has been in his same i built houses sort of things but.

43
00:05:31,48 --> 00:05:34,53
Because i know i think he says to another because like.

44
00:05:34,53 --> 00:05:38,8
My parents in the people who set up the community came straight from the sea.

45
00:05:38,8 --> 00:05:43,06
Are always remember there was always a bathroom and there was always a kitchen. I mean.

46
00:05:43,06 --> 00:05:49,69
So it wasn't like we mean we still had to use the gas lamps every. You know. That the main the.

47
00:05:49,69 --> 00:05:54,55
The bottom house which was what was the first. Regional buildings always had electricity.

48
00:05:54,55 --> 00:05:59,51
And always had all the light is mud cons basically i mean that's the way i saw it.

49
00:05:59,51 --> 00:06:05,23
But the bush experience from a water to spain. As janice said.

50
00:06:05,23 --> 00:06:09,55
We were just given the freedom and the trust i think that's. I mean i.

51
00:06:09,75 --> 00:06:16,02
It wasn't a conscious thing then but reflecting back. I mean you know my kid. Friends say oh and you know.

52
00:06:16,02 --> 00:06:20,98
Mom wouldn't let me do this mom going to let me do that and. I mean. Yeah the creek.

53
00:06:20,98 --> 00:06:28,21
Was a major source we'd just go for. Day explorations up the creek and weed.

54
00:06:28,21 --> 00:06:36,97
I know i wouldn't exactly said i would know how to build my own house although i'm sure. My mom would disagree. That.

55
00:06:36,97 --> 00:06:46,88
You know base self-sufficient you know because. I think as kids we were really not asked to do a lot. I mean. You know.

56
00:06:46,88 --> 00:06:53,52
We didn't have trolls. As such we were just given the freedom to explore and i mean.

57
00:06:53,52 --> 00:06:59,41
I think the so-called bush experiences has just given me.

58
00:06:59,41 --> 00:07:05,92
And i you just you know i haven't meant so much technical things of. How to set up. You saw deviousness.

59
00:07:05,92 --> 00:07:07,62
Nice city folk being that.

60
00:07:07,62 --> 00:07:09,29
That's what the experience is all about

61
00:07:09,29 --> 00:07:14,99
but it's it's kind of i await of life the way of looking at things sort of like.

62
00:07:14,99 --> 00:07:20,67
Ok you've got a tall waterfall and you want to get to the top. You know i had to do it so i think he's like.

63
00:07:20,67 --> 00:07:35,74
And if that's answer the question. You know why. I remember. My biological father mother of three the school.

64
00:07:35,74 --> 00:07:42,8
Actually he started the community school that i went to which played a big part in my life.

65
00:07:42,8 --> 00:07:48,67
So it's quite interesting relighting them relating to them as parents as well as my teacher.

66
00:07:48,67 --> 00:07:56,88
And it was a very interesting way to relight as i'm you know i wasn't a father figure or a mother figure. You know.

67
00:07:56,88 --> 00:08:04,03
Was someone there to. That was no way should we get out of them and stuff. But in a fun y.

68
00:08:04,03 --> 00:08:12,27
All remember a lot of a lot of good times laughing times with them. But i always seem to be busy.

69
00:08:12,27 --> 00:08:25,56
Happy and always ready to share share the parenting like was unlike the white man who was lucky. She was happy to.

70
00:08:25,56 --> 00:08:40,46
Lotus or found other people and. We could spend time with so. So it was an interesting experience with a nice school.

71
00:08:40,46 --> 00:08:50,68
So i guess. The key really to school. I guess i knew. On into hammy's i went there.

72
00:08:50,68 --> 00:08:56,73
The main thing at the community school armand is kid circus. And a curious school.

73
00:08:56,73 --> 00:09:03,72
Was into buildings there was the can really school which is being old commonwealth bank i think.

74
00:09:03,72 --> 00:09:12,66
And that was the main school and ahead. And i i mean it wasn't like a school because there was rooms.

75
00:09:12,66 --> 00:09:19,45
But there was a kitchen and and. Because it was like it was like a house really more than a bank and.

76
00:09:19,45 --> 00:09:25,46
So you know we do cooking. As in home science but it would be. I mean.

77
00:09:25,46 --> 00:09:30,28
The same and nimbin in the way one taught in the community school was. It wasn't like.

78
00:09:30,28 --> 00:09:35,91
You're going to learn how to make these it's. Oh yeah well. If you managed to make it at the end that's fine.

79
00:09:35,91 --> 00:09:41,67
But all the lessons along the way is more important i still had this one memory of. We're making.

80
00:09:41,67 --> 00:09:47,49
Toffee i think it was and. As it was one stove and.

81
00:09:47,49 --> 00:09:51,62
Ten people making coffee and i had two people play a part we're staring where you. And the.

82
00:09:51,62 --> 00:09:54,98
By the time the last person had cooked their tuffy and.

83
00:09:54,98 --> 00:10:00,01
Ready to go to the next say it's a first person's toffee was had. So here was our first lesson and.

84
00:10:00,01 --> 00:10:03,77
And then there was the lesson of. If we use a metal spoon we're going to get hot.

85
00:10:03,77 --> 00:10:06,13
But if we use a wooden spoon it's going to burn.

86
00:10:06,13 --> 00:10:12,18
And if we use a plastic spoon is going to melt so which option is the best. I mean i have all these crazy memories.

87
00:10:12,18 --> 00:10:20,27
But. I mean it's just great i mean basically. I have lots of just. Stories and memories from the community school.

88
00:10:20,9 --> 00:10:26,83
The other party community schools the t.a.'s all the tomato sauce. And the tomato sauce arm and the as.

89
00:10:26,83 --> 00:10:36,62
The kid circus space and wood. Woodworks price down malone and. And pottery. Poetry was we had a little.

90
00:10:36,62 --> 00:10:44,79
Wheel on things like that and. I have to tell you the story. I was real young and. We had.

91
00:10:44,79 --> 00:10:49,95
We were going at the moment decided we're going to start doing cindy exhausting.

92
00:10:49,95 --> 00:10:52,93
And so she said right we're going out to get the jigsaw.

93
00:10:52,93 --> 00:10:59,5
Beauty thoughts out this is great i want to get to show all my friends my new camera. The frog and miss piggy.

94
00:10:59,5 --> 00:11:03,41
Did so a puzzle that i had just got the other day. So we rocked. You know.

95
00:11:03,41 --> 00:11:09,75
Mom we had a basket he was going to drive back to pave a and. Mom got outby wood to work.

96
00:11:09,75 --> 00:11:14,5
Jigsaw that cuts wood and so he's going. That doesn't look like my t. Saw.

97
00:11:14,5 --> 00:11:21,96
So i mean that's the way you kind of learn things it was like. I mean really in that i had great fun and i mean.

98
00:11:21,96 --> 00:11:24,39
Our members.

99
00:11:24,39 --> 00:11:26,1
Have to i'm kind of got all these stories

100
00:11:26,1 --> 00:11:32,58
and i can only tell you because they just why is it wrong that not answering a question that they can really do school

101
00:11:32,58 --> 00:11:43,91
on members being on him when i first went to a so-called. Proper. I don't know where you want to go public school.

102
00:11:43,91 --> 00:11:54,34
Really worried that i wouldn't be up to scratch. But. I now realize that i case i maybe there wasn't you know.

103
00:11:54,88 --> 00:12:01,63
The heaviest. Emphasis on. Let's getting the academic work. But i lent. So many other things.

104
00:12:01,63 --> 00:12:08,52
So many important things about life i mean. Not. You know great loss stories i mean you know nothing like that.

105
00:12:08,52 --> 00:12:16,66
But just so many things. That is changed. And i made the way i am that you really would have gotten.

106
00:12:16,66 --> 00:12:20,23
In an ordinary school because i mean just.

107
00:12:20,23 --> 00:12:26,7
And you know just the why it was taught as a start with an i mean i mean business. Kid circus i mean.

108
00:12:26,7 --> 00:12:33,51
Hey i could talk that. The kid circles are have to say. When the community school first. We had a day a week.

109
00:12:33,51 --> 00:12:37,38
I think i was on my quite sure i was so young artist remember.

110
00:12:37,65 --> 00:12:45,45
And it was just a major influence in my life i was a klan. Later on i got nine. Barely pants but.

111
00:12:45,45 --> 00:12:51,67
A when i first started i don't think i had a name. I was just a clown. And i remember we did this.

112
00:12:51,67 --> 00:12:57,47
And i got our performance. Together and. And we do it and it same to me that.

113
00:12:57,47 --> 00:13:02,04
We may as well have gone to seed me and it turned out now that we only went to ballad but the travel

114
00:13:02,04 --> 00:13:09,15
and the excitement and things like that and i think i mean now there's no way i can get up on stage

115
00:13:09,15 --> 00:13:16,84
and do all that sort of stuff that i used to like. I could but i would go home get only embarrassed. With that just.

116
00:13:17,68 --> 00:13:20,59
It was good that it didn't give you the confidence that.

117
00:13:20,59 --> 00:13:25,74
Oh i'm so wonderful and all this sort of stuff but it gave you. Confidence in yourself.

118
00:13:25,74 --> 00:13:31,21
You didn't think that you were better than anyone else just because you were on stage. You didn't think that.

119
00:13:31,73 --> 00:13:34,05
Oh i know you just.

120
00:13:34,05 --> 00:13:38,66
You just thought you felt really so confident in yourself and you saw this is great

121
00:13:38,66 --> 00:13:45,45
and i just remember having so much fun. I mean the community schools are right. It was like. I mean.

122
00:13:46,24 --> 00:13:50,02
Oh i can i mean i can remember specifically lessons.

123
00:13:50,02 --> 00:13:55,42
Are communal one specific lesson of learning about the parts of a frog. And i mean you're.

124
00:13:55,42 --> 00:13:58,49
Like i don't remember any of this sort of stuff from. You know.

125
00:13:58,49 --> 00:14:03,58
Public schools it's all just all year where we wanted to spell we went to a want to write. But just.

126
00:14:04,1 --> 00:14:09,55
I don't know if it was because it was that stage in my life but i'm in this specific incidence and.

127
00:14:09,7 --> 00:14:17,98
Things like that just really stand there and. God helps me get through my boy economics periods that. I may have.

128
00:14:17,98 --> 00:14:22,92
My friends still. They still guy. Do you think it's really and.

129
00:14:22,92 --> 00:14:28,02
Now you're just joking at me when i was really in a second so i tell my story then.

130
00:14:29,25 --> 00:14:35,6
Yeah the community school is just yeah as i said taught you a lot of stuff.

131
00:14:35,6 --> 00:14:45,15
Not necessarily strict academic stuff but it's pretty damn fun. Yeah i'd go along with that.

132
00:14:45,15 --> 00:14:55,61
Just the stall in which i taught it. My i've lots of memories of the community school. But no one is actually learning.

133
00:14:55,61 --> 00:14:56,72
Like being sat down

134
00:14:56,72 --> 00:15:03,47
and saying learn this you have to not for tests no tests not nothing like that basically is the sharing of knowledge to

135
00:15:03,47 --> 00:15:08,91
the younger kids. I mean. I remember going to actual. Public school.

136
00:15:08,91 --> 00:15:15,62
For a short period of time and being you know you know there's going to be like proper academic questions with math

137
00:15:15,62 --> 00:15:23,5
and thing. I sat down in a class with kids my age. Not actually think you have ever done mass. Sat down with questions.

138
00:15:23,5 --> 00:15:29,28
And i breezed through them. I was at the top of the class. By big majority right.

139
00:15:29,28 --> 00:15:35,16
When he was always like my teacher thought here. I mean i had. I had a rat's tile my hair was shaved i was a rat's.

140
00:15:35,16 --> 00:15:41,17
You know i didn't have a uniform i was just you know i was just a little hippie kid with. You know.

141
00:15:41,17 --> 00:15:48,51
Shocked everyone and here i was why i had everyone else in my schooling. Academia saw it and.

142
00:15:48,51 --> 00:15:55,33
I think the community school was just wonderful. Really was i mean sad mention the circus thousand credible.

143
00:15:55,33 --> 00:16:04,23
That really was. Our main. I think the biggest thing that i still have is the memory where. Also a dog.

144
00:16:04,23 --> 00:16:09,55
And i had to go out and do a certain saying that i came in early. But of course the.

145
00:16:09,6 --> 00:16:16,84
Well what you know i didn't know but to me it was a big thing yard coming early in my act and. Oh no what should i do.

146
00:16:16,84 --> 00:16:19,74
You know to things as close as a little kid that was important to me

147
00:16:19,74 --> 00:16:26,37
but i remember several scenes in like in performing in front of like it seemed like everyone in the moon would come out

148
00:16:26,37 --> 00:16:34,22
to say. I remember. For me in the data factory. It's a big concert. The whole thing and we did a performance and.

149
00:16:34,22 --> 00:16:39,03
It seemed like everyone in my whole world of nimbin was there watching us on stage

150
00:16:39,03 --> 00:16:44,11
and i was a real bad so there's a really good things out there. It's incredible but.

151
00:16:44,11 --> 00:16:47,51
I mean like doing the aboriginal studies. You know.

152
00:16:47,51 --> 00:16:52,74
I mean this day and night i mean you know i just better go and you ten. And like.

153
00:16:52,74 --> 00:17:00,5
You know you learn about a struggle jaan. Sure you do. Aboriginals and our night. But you don't learn a.

154
00:17:00,5 --> 00:17:09,81
Really about them. We had a man who just knew so much about them we took camping trips up in rivers. And we go and we.

155
00:17:09,81 --> 00:17:15,77
Bicycle live. Like them and learnt about them and. Like them and. It was just incredible like.

156
00:17:15,77 --> 00:17:21,24
You know here we were only young. But learning just incredible skills and knowledge that.

157
00:17:21,24 --> 00:17:27,77
There's so many about they just won't know. Probably the whole loft and here we were through the community school.

158
00:17:27,85 --> 00:17:28,62
You know.

159
00:17:28,62 --> 00:17:33,64
Learning about such things as that was incredible

160
00:17:33,64 --> 00:17:41,44
and i said that that was disappointed janice said was amazing was that we learned. Sign that. It was. I mean.

161
00:17:42,48 --> 00:17:44,71
Maybe because it wasn't categorized into.

162
00:17:44,71 --> 00:17:50,54
This is what you know and you see and this is what you know and next year i have to say that.

163
00:17:50,54 --> 00:17:53,78
Although it was different. The amount that i've lent.

164
00:17:53,78 --> 00:17:58,02
Well i can only say it because the time spans different the set in manama in the time span i was in human

165
00:17:58,02 --> 00:18:03,93
and then there same time span outside. Was just. Although i learnt a lot of other things.

166
00:18:05,04 --> 00:18:10,57
It was just as i said all my memories from. Nimbin all my childhood there. Please.

167
00:18:10,57 --> 00:18:14,37
Every memory that i always go back and chuckle on. Is foam.

168
00:18:14,37 --> 00:18:21,00
Before i left which was when i was i so i as have i have to say we just saw a match. It was.

169
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:26,81
I mean basically it just provided a whole dice. I mean as. Mom was saying ilya.

170
00:18:26,81 --> 00:18:34,6
Having all these different influences and not having me. Teach our student relationship. Not having met. You know that.

171
00:18:34,6 --> 00:18:40,86
So-called relationship. It was good because you wouldn't just say. They just want to sort of thing you think. Well.

172
00:18:40,86 --> 00:18:46,35
Or respect this person so actually going to want to learn about what they have to share and i think.

173
00:18:46,35 --> 00:18:54,93
Having such a number of adults and a really broad base. Manes that. We were able to.

174
00:18:54,93 --> 00:18:57,15
Really say well i think that idea is right

175
00:18:57,15 --> 00:19:03,84
and i think that idea is wrong in just that community school the whole atmosphere and environment. Really lettuce.

176
00:19:04,65 --> 00:19:12,8
And just so much just really self that i think is really important to base your character for the rest of the act.

177
00:19:12,8 --> 00:19:17,85
And actually learning all of it. Like us might not have said before wasn't in a teaching my.

178
00:19:17,85 --> 00:19:22,85
As such as we're used to in this. You know. Schooling system.

179
00:19:23,37 --> 00:19:30,48
We wouldn't sit down in class and psycho we're going to learn this. As such and learn that you have to now it. It was.

180
00:19:30,48 --> 00:19:37,71
I can't remember being taught as such something direct. We just learnt it.

181
00:19:37,71 --> 00:19:41,8
In that do it in practice by sickly they want to teach or something would go

182
00:19:41,8 --> 00:19:45,79
and do it so we'd learn from it is served out of a textbook. You know.

183
00:19:45,79 --> 00:19:49,33
We want to learn about the oceans and how it worked would go to the ocean.

184
00:19:49,33 --> 00:19:53,91
Would spend away camping on it and would learn about it much more than. Learn reading out of a textbook.

185
00:19:53,91 --> 00:19:59,87
You know it was just incredible the way they taught it to us i think it was a mine. Thing that matters learned so much.

186
00:20:10,09 --> 00:20:17,05
Yes. There was. There was the public school which was just down the road.

187
00:20:17,05 --> 00:20:24,01
And there so there's a community school in the public school. But i think the whole of.

188
00:20:24,01 --> 00:20:33,74
Really just learn to integrate and one that wasn't wasn't. Segregation like you know rednecks and.

189
00:20:33,74 --> 00:20:38,02
Hillbillies the like in america nothing like that basically. That i can recall.

190
00:20:39,98 --> 00:20:44,79
I think though i have to disagree with that has different memories and.

191
00:20:44,79 --> 00:20:52,11
It wasn't there was i wouldn't even say separation that's too strong a word. There was this.

192
00:20:52,11 --> 00:20:54,83
The words of difference in separation too strong.

193
00:20:54,83 --> 00:21:01,43
There were people who went to the community school and they were the people who went to human sensual.

194
00:21:01,43 --> 00:21:05,34
And every lunch times i used to track up by their luncheon.

195
00:21:05,34 --> 00:21:10,87
Some top of the state we used to have the good old oh yes and i used to hassle us and we still has a limb.

196
00:21:10,87 --> 00:21:19,68
But guy i'm on the bus together we're all friends so it was like it was there. But i never really think it got to the.

197
00:21:19,68 --> 00:21:23,92
It never was you know and tegan you stick around and if that's right word i'm not going to be on english

198
00:21:23,92 --> 00:21:32,91
but it was just. It was there because i think we i don't know if we had. It was that.

199
00:21:32,91 --> 00:21:39,79
That was you know that society those groups or. If we were just having fun because.

200
00:21:39,79 --> 00:21:43,01
Hey why not because i don't know if that's even made sure not

201
00:21:43,01 --> 00:21:48,83
but it never in my experience never was anything more than a friendly joke.

202
00:21:48,87 --> 00:21:52,8
I mean i mean it model been for the older kids but.

203
00:21:52,8 --> 00:21:56,86
I mean as i said going home on a bus that wasn't a problem you know there was no.

204
00:21:56,86 --> 00:22:05,72
You sitting next to who you want anything at that because i think i know. It was just. Those two different schools and.

205
00:22:05,72 --> 00:22:13,17
You know we all. We all still. Had you know. Still human so it wasn't really a problem i think that was good.

206
00:22:13,17 --> 00:22:16,35
Having being out and i thought was because it was my age.

207
00:22:16,35 --> 00:22:22,5
I was still in that kind of naive group where everybody is my friend in that.

208
00:22:22,5 --> 00:22:29,46
You know i think that's just another thing and if we got out of nimbin it was like. Well it doesn't matter.

209
00:22:29,46 --> 00:22:33,12
You know i mean it doesn't matter if that person's driving a.

210
00:22:33,12 --> 00:22:40,02
You know miss avies news person driving a bomb dropped their friends their friends sort of being in. I think that was.

211
00:22:40,02 --> 00:22:51,36
Yeah. That was really. Yeah and of the ball that us really. One memory.

212
00:22:51,36 --> 00:22:56,99
If you could call it memories of not having any memory of ever getting in trouble.

213
00:22:58,56 --> 00:23:05,00
Various friends and i say i face memory and then my mom he me or something like that which is. And i mean i remember.

214
00:23:05,79 --> 00:23:15,49
Without going into specific detail. A few. Myself and a few friends. Demolished a certain spice of the person.

215
00:23:16,98 --> 00:23:23,2
I don't know that we even really had a reason we did. To begin with but then i think we've got carried away with.

216
00:23:23,2 --> 00:23:30,31
Demolishing the spice basically in all of its contents. And in there. As soon as we'd finished.

217
00:23:30,31 --> 00:23:36,83
Were absolutely horrified it ourselves i mean. Wade. We were crying and shaking just at the thought of.

218
00:23:36,83 --> 00:23:42,76
Because we know. We knew what he had done was just sorry wrong it was just so out of law it was just.

219
00:23:42,76 --> 00:23:50,26
I mean basically we knew we'd been totally irresponsible and. And i guess also because we knew that we deserved to.

220
00:23:50,26 --> 00:23:58,92
You know. Not have lost trust but. I mean we knew that we'd broken trust and.

221
00:23:58,92 --> 00:24:03,38
And i remember we were just absolutely terrified.

222
00:24:03,38 --> 00:24:09,55
But we said right well we've got to we've done these horrific acts you know we've got to do this. So we.

223
00:24:10,2 --> 00:24:17,14
And i don't even remember an angry voice. I don't remember. A person saying. Oh. Tough time.

224
00:24:17,64 --> 00:24:24,1
I mean i really doubt all our members have in their state newspaper between pages of what books that have been left

225
00:24:24,1 --> 00:24:34,87
there have not and. But i don't i think that. It was a situation where. It wasn't like we could get away with it.

226
00:24:34,87 --> 00:24:39,24
But it wasn't what we got in trouble somehow we. We.

227
00:24:39,24 --> 00:24:46,47
We knew we learned from the whole process and learned that what we done was wrong and. You know went on from there.

228
00:24:46,47 --> 00:24:53,52
Without having to be yelled at i mean basically i was. I was never yelled at. I mean. Oh that's not true.

229
00:24:53,52 --> 00:24:58,57
Well yes it is actually our day. I mean i don't know if it's this good all that's block out the bad memories but.

230
00:24:58,57 --> 00:25:05,59
I mean we all had our disagreements and i remember. John and i used to fart like. Tears in that.

231
00:25:05,59 --> 00:25:10,29
But even our even this is classic memory even when we were fighting.

232
00:25:10,29 --> 00:25:14,32
He still used to call me sour and i still used to call him. Bines.

233
00:25:14,32 --> 00:25:18,39
But we became sell to do that and they are in usually you know in some good thing you know.

234
00:25:18,39 --> 00:25:26,77
So we obviously come down here sort of being and. Yeah i mean. I'm in the general i used to not get on.

235
00:25:26,77 --> 00:25:36,28
But we used to get on sort of being but. Now i never went. When disciplined. Yet we didn't turn out to be raucous.

236
00:25:36,28 --> 00:25:40,96
Oh ok. We orchestrated. We didn't turn out to be our you know.

237
00:25:40,96 --> 00:25:41,85
Rebels to society

238
00:25:41,85 --> 00:25:50,3
or anything like that it was just think it was respect just make sure it's basically art full young so i said like.

239
00:25:50,3 --> 00:25:54,45
There was never i mean i remember one case. There was a very clear.

240
00:25:54,45 --> 00:26:00,63
There was nothing on the fame on one mile didn't matter a thing. All our friends.

241
00:26:00,63 --> 00:26:06,56
It was just a group of kids didn't matter girls didn't matter boys. You know. Being naked.

242
00:26:06,56 --> 00:26:12,63
Didn't mean a thing you know he's around the font family. You know. Didn't matter but.

243
00:26:12,63 --> 00:26:19,89
I mean i remember for some reason. This girl came out. Said hi jonah. And i hit it.

244
00:26:19,89 --> 00:26:26,79
I mean i was the first time of ever hit someone in my life i think. I hear. I i stood there i didn't know why he died.

245
00:26:26,79 --> 00:26:35,56
And she just today didn't know why he. I you know i hear this and then she started crawling him on and i went to bed.

246
00:26:35,56 --> 00:26:42,63
Which is just another mother figure and said oh not to come across said what happened to hit me so she comes

247
00:26:42,63 --> 00:26:48,92
and everything. And then beth comes out i mean what did you hit it john i said.

248
00:26:48,92 --> 00:26:53,83
Sort of because she said whoa all right. Oh that's all i could think of all right.

249
00:26:53,83 --> 00:26:58,33
Ok i don't know ration to be shaking so i knew i'd never be hit or anything

250
00:26:58,33 --> 00:27:03,33
but still the fact i'd done something wrong you know. And she goes. Well that's right.

251
00:27:03,33 --> 00:27:10,77
I take no shit from nobody if i say hello to him. So the why of the why you know like disciplining people.

252
00:27:10,77 --> 00:27:12,74
Was it a little light hearted.

253
00:27:12,74 --> 00:27:18,74
Funny well i mean she could say that i didn't mean it knows no while going to continue to do it but it was just yeah.

254
00:27:18,74 --> 00:27:24,85
Just cases like that which i think. I think it's incredible why we brought out. I mean it's really benefited.

255
00:27:25,16 --> 00:27:30,64
I think may i think it was a litle off down hard just the way we were light.

256
00:27:30,64 --> 00:27:36,41
To last and everything is totally different because of our childhood upbringing.

257
00:27:36,41 --> 00:27:40,56
I think also just the way we would have made us.

258
00:27:40,56 --> 00:27:48,19
I mean just reflecting just now on what jenna said and when i say we both knew that we done something wrong and.

259
00:27:48,19 --> 00:27:55,74
I mean. Before we even so-called confessed. Seems out of that. We knew that. That was just tell what and it was like.

260
00:27:55,74 --> 00:28:03,72
I think that another caller id that we've got out of you know how we've been brought up. Is that.

261
00:28:03,72 --> 00:28:10,35
The rate only maybe the reason there wasn't such discipline. Was there wasn't a need for it. I mean.

262
00:28:11,35 --> 00:28:15,66
I don't know if that was just i mean that was probably why we bought out we knew that that was right.

263
00:28:15,66 --> 00:28:21,39
And that was wrong i mean. Yeah i mean. We still had disagreements.

264
00:28:21,39 --> 00:28:26,46
I mean i remember there was big disagreement i have my vegetable ating habits and stuff like that.

265
00:28:26,46 --> 00:28:30,32
This is this very title he was the one we used to cram twenty paper on

266
00:28:30,32 --> 00:28:35,6
and i used to hate visuals so i used to pass the law right now turn my head in.

267
00:28:35,6 --> 00:28:42,38
Under the table and one day he pays a brothel i think hit mom on the leg and she looked.

268
00:28:42,38 --> 00:28:52,57
And there was dr contents of my plight and. A will. And i think. I mean that wasn't my issue but.

269
00:28:52,57 --> 00:28:59,24
Finally he was also and he kind of all the considered you my older brother decided.

270
00:28:59,24 --> 00:29:04,88
Because i has thing that he said look to slaver line. She's surviving. I think of something like that and they did.

271
00:29:04,88 --> 00:29:14,24
I mean. I'm still not liking them vegetables but i'm not dying in. Yeah it was. It was. That was another thing that.

272
00:29:14,24 --> 00:29:21,77
Their parents. Adults had respect for the kids. It wasn't like oh yes. Nice deal what if he said i just go why imply.

273
00:29:22,39 --> 00:29:28,17
And so i think that. Because we were given respect. We could give respect and trust back.

274
00:29:28,31 --> 00:29:33,56
And so when we done something wrong we just say look i've done this wrong and.

275
00:29:33,56 --> 00:29:40,85
But it was a thing and spit out what so you said earlier about type. Bring your older brother.

276
00:29:40,85 --> 00:29:49,72
That's one thing which on the community. Was a big thing. Like outside it was a huge family. I mean i see.

277
00:29:51,16 --> 00:29:58,66
Jamie all these guys and. And girls on the farm. As my older brothers and sisters and younger brothers and sisters.

278
00:29:58,66 --> 00:30:06,65
Biologically. Ok we weren't. But we were just as close. Like you know like. If not close if we had troubles like.

279
00:30:07,43 --> 00:30:16,75
When i was just little. Carry me around driving around in a cardboard box and. I see they testify they believe hartson.

280
00:30:16,75 --> 00:30:27,32
You know is just one big happy family with the hate of parents right. And i hate brothers and sisters. It wasn't like.

281
00:30:27,32 --> 00:30:34,07
Doll that family that are under that name and we were here. By sickly. Brothers and sisters. You know.

282
00:30:34,07 --> 00:30:37,44
Just really good. Have to say that.

283
00:30:37,44 --> 00:30:42,47
Now being attain a so-called adolescent teenager

284
00:30:42,47 --> 00:30:51,51
and talking with all my friends i would just have to say that my child would have to be. Probably the happiest. I mean.

285
00:30:51,51 --> 00:30:56,07
Living it. I could not have wanted it any other way. It was just.

286
00:30:56,07 --> 00:31:02,7
I mean i don't know if i'd want to live there now because i have manus so it's hard to say. But it was just.

287
00:31:03,54 --> 00:31:06,18
It was just me going through

288
00:31:06,18 --> 00:31:10,29
and living it i was just thinking oh this is pretty normal doesn't everyone leave like these i mean.

289
00:31:10,29 --> 00:31:16,2
I didn't really think that but i just said i had this is great i am heaven he's a fun and fantastic but.

290
00:31:16,2 --> 00:31:24,28
Looking back you know fretting and all that sort of stuff. I'll just have to say that it was just unbelievable.

291
00:31:24,28 --> 00:31:31,35
I can't. I still i mean it shocks me myself i still to sit back and go. Wow. I just had the best time.

292
