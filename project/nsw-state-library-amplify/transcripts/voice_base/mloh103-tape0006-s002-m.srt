1
00:00:12,87 --> 00:00:14,05
Straight. I can start again.

2
00:00:16,81 --> 00:00:21,26
And i remember watching one of his kind of derelicts and and people at that in the street

3
00:00:21,26 --> 00:00:26,52
and especially this one guy called trey who i'm sure you'll hear about time and time again. And.

4
00:00:26,52 --> 00:00:29,76
He would sit in the straight and sort of try and beg from paypal

5
00:00:29,76 --> 00:00:33,15
and just talked himself because he's actually quite insane and.

6
00:00:33,15 --> 00:00:37,83
The money that he used to get from his doll checks and from. Begging from people.

7
00:00:37,83 --> 00:00:42,64
He would line up in rows of sort of one and two saying coins were ten ten paces in the straight.

8
00:00:42,64 --> 00:00:45,06
And he would count his why along them.

9
00:00:45,06 --> 00:00:49,26
And and work out whether he was actually going to have enough to buy a flag in that day.

10
00:00:49,26 --> 00:00:53,13
And he would kind of put a mark of further off in the strain i remember watching him do it quite clearly.

11
00:00:53,13 --> 00:00:58,54
He put a marker a piece of wood where his coins would have to get to in order for him to be able to afford this flag

12
00:00:58,54 --> 00:01:01,7
and i just thought well this really is a desperate situation isn't it. I mean i had.

13
00:01:01,7 --> 00:01:06,26
You know two dollars fifty in my pocket myself to go and by law is within you know that wasn't a problem

14
00:01:06,26 --> 00:01:11,23
but this guy just didn't have under control and there are a lot of people like that who are kind of sit

15
00:01:11,23 --> 00:01:14,74
and have really slow kind of.

16
00:01:14,74 --> 00:01:19,11
Maining with arguments in the street and they would never raise their voices or actually get animated

17
00:01:19,11 --> 00:01:24,22
or anything like that just sit there and argue it out old dying get really in-depth vet everything.

18
00:01:24,22 --> 00:01:28,76
And then are in the other people who just kind of sit there with a guitar with their bungalows

19
00:01:28,76 --> 00:01:32,04
and not ply them with alice and say you know you

20
00:01:32,04 --> 00:01:37,03
and so you'd walk past some really hairy find you seen they're looking at his guitar. And he hasn't worked out yet.

21
00:01:37,03 --> 00:01:42,9
You know that he's not playing all that he can play it. You know to skate. You know just keep going. You know.

22
00:01:43,45 --> 00:01:47,97
I remember the one. You know when people receive these tynan and sort of dance around.

23
00:01:47,97 --> 00:01:52,55
And they're getting right into it and feeling really good about everything and kind of. You know.

24
00:01:52,55 --> 00:01:57,85
Makes everyone feel a little bit uncomfortable. These people are doing it because it is something really.

25
00:01:57,85 --> 00:02:02,96
Last about it. And you know. I mean i remember a lot of sort of messy situations where people would.

26
00:02:02,96 --> 00:02:06,97
Would fight about money or. About something like that and then. And.

27
00:02:06,97 --> 00:02:12,07
And i would say another person come in and set a little down and. Like say say people being treated like.

28
00:02:12,43 --> 00:02:17,04
Children all the time. That's really funny thing because you know. It's like you know communities with.

29
00:02:17,04 --> 00:02:21,92
Whenever things blow up there are always people a step in and try and sort them out. And so this i mean even when.

30
00:02:21,92 --> 00:02:22,86
All of you know.

31
00:02:22,86 --> 00:02:28,34
When the situation on the street got out of hand the paper would step in and diffuse little and sort of.

32
00:02:28,34 --> 00:02:32,74
Pat if you're on the back and say you know it's like when you don't have to worry about it. And you know.

33
00:02:32,74 --> 00:02:38,91
As often as not. These situations would just sort of die down straight away. And i mean.

34
00:02:38,91 --> 00:02:44,33
And i would probably have an image of the place. As being very kind of nasty. And violent.

35
00:02:44,33 --> 00:02:49,72
And i would have dark side twelve. That. But he does have to remember that it's people trying to get on with a thing.

36
00:02:49,72 --> 00:02:58,7
And those situations can. You know it can actually be resolved as well and. So knowing. You know. All right.

37
00:02:58,7 --> 00:03:00,47
The other thing is like even.

38
00:03:00,47 --> 00:03:05,04
All of those families like ours that when it moved down there and lived in a half built tent

39
00:03:05,04 --> 00:03:12,56
or something like that you know. We always had sort of food and beds and our own sort of domestic situation sorted out.

40
00:03:12,56 --> 00:03:18,08
You know. And there was this whole other group of people that i haven't really talked about. Yet. The kind of.

41
00:03:18,08 --> 00:03:24,66
Feral people who have chosen to live in a completely kind of feral existence. Up in in the bush is with now you can of.

42
00:03:24,66 --> 00:03:29,3
You know civilized housing or any of that type of thing. And they get really really dirty.

43
00:03:29,3 --> 00:03:35,49
And they live in a really really primitive way. And it's funny because i know that they're living in a primitive way.

44
00:03:35,49 --> 00:03:39,47
And that they're not sort of. You know. Having any kind of western. You know.

45
00:03:39,47 --> 00:03:42,49
Material things around them or anything like that. But then again.

46
00:03:42,49 --> 00:03:46,4
They're doing it as a reaction to the western way of living and so what they're doing is kind of like.

47
00:03:46,4 --> 00:03:54,46
Anti western living. As opposed to just a natural instinct to feral way of living which indigenous people would do and.

48
00:03:54,46 --> 00:04:01,97
It's really funny to see the lengths that they have to go to in order to maintain a kind of really simple and and.

49
00:04:01,97 --> 00:04:08,65
Unconscious type of lifestyle and you know. But the whole thing about. You know. Having a cough example.

50
00:04:08,65 --> 00:04:13,53
One of the more i have a car because eventually they're going to have to go somewhere. And and. You know.

51
00:04:13,53 --> 00:04:22,24
But i'd like to sort of pretend that i don't have a car and they don't need any of that type of stuff coming. And.

52
00:04:23,24 --> 00:04:28,2
And so you've got these kind of groups of people making a massive effort to leave. You know really kind of simple way.

53
00:04:28,2 --> 00:04:30,26
And going out of their way to do it continuously.

54
00:04:30,26 --> 00:04:35,06
I mean my whole life i've never actually stopped to think why that would doing it because like there are some things

55
00:04:35,06 --> 00:04:41,87
like pornography and you know. Advertising and things like that which i really dislike about our consumers to society.

56
00:04:41,87 --> 00:04:46,96
But then. There you know. All of the rest of it seems quite acceptable to me. Whether you take it on.

57
00:04:46,96 --> 00:04:50,04
As a really serious type of thing where you just do it without thinking about it.

58
00:04:50,04 --> 00:05:00,92
And so i don't see what actually requires that if it. Was through.

59
00:05:00,92 --> 00:05:04,76
Well you know this that you know there's also the dilemma that they are trying to be self-sufficient

60
00:05:04,76 --> 00:05:11,09
but in the end they're going to need to get some money somehow. And so they can rely on. Society to support them.

61
00:05:11,09 --> 00:05:13,79
Or they can try and produce something that's all value.

62
00:05:13,95 --> 00:05:16,83
And when they you know when they produce those things like the things i sell the markets

63
00:05:16,83 --> 00:05:22,08
and stuff like that they're trying to in the most organic. Kind of. Or you know down to earth possible way.

64
00:05:22,08 --> 00:05:27,62
But they're still relying on a very kind of. You know western society approach to doing the whole thing.

65
00:05:27,62 --> 00:05:32,77
In order to make it work. And so you know. Even though they validate alternative lifestyles. They should.

66
00:05:32,77 --> 00:05:38,08
You know be careful to acknowledge that they're still kind of participating in our mainstream society

67
00:05:38,08 --> 00:05:40,82
and that it's still sort of. You know tourists and.

68
00:05:40,82 --> 00:05:45,45
Those kind of people who are buying their things and supporting their lifestyle. You know as.

69
00:05:45,45 --> 00:05:57,51
Removed and as simple as i think that monday. You see these. Valuable those this guy who's.

70
00:05:58,71 --> 00:06:01,94
There's this guy who was there before i arrived who.

71
00:06:01,94 --> 00:06:08,07
Was convinced that eileen's when they were going to come down and sort of. You know the whole planet.

72
00:06:08,33 --> 00:06:12,07
And that was going to happen on this particular night in this particular place. And he took a whole lot of pay.

73
00:06:12,27 --> 00:06:14,78
Well there. And they stayed up all mine.

74
00:06:14,78 --> 00:06:18,5
And watched a couple of satellites going overhead and were almost convinced at one stage

75
00:06:18,5 --> 00:06:20,72
but neither no hole kind of fell down.

76
00:06:20,72 --> 00:06:26,15
I mean it was one of those classic things where the actual event didn't tie place. But the purpose of the event.

77
00:06:26,23 --> 00:06:30,95
You know i was just as powerful anyway because all these people were actually brought together by at. And you know.

78
00:06:30,95 --> 00:06:34,31
And something started. Through and that was out of my own bimby and you know.

79
00:06:34,31 --> 00:06:38,58
They ended up starting from medical communes out there. And you know he was a big part of all of that.

80
00:06:38,58 --> 00:06:42,54
But just you know a lot of those kind of trippers who make everyone stop

81
00:06:42,54 --> 00:06:48,86
and listen to their story about whether it's eileen's. Or about armageddon or whatever you know i have over.

82
00:06:48,86 --> 00:06:53,91
This sort of thing in common where all i want is for everyone to gather around and listen to their story.

83
00:06:53,91 --> 00:07:01,91
But the actual contents of the story are usually completely meaningless or you know. Completely. Nonsense.

84
00:07:01,91 --> 00:07:10,45
And i'm putting forward to you my. My proposition that it's.

85
00:07:10,45 --> 00:07:19,32
The police that are largely responsible for the i have a willing. Presence of.

86
00:07:19,32 --> 00:07:22,73
The hard drug scene in nimbin at the moment. I mean.

87
00:07:22,73 --> 00:07:29,97
I believe that it's just that there are too many of them i mean there's bound to be a small number of people using

88
00:07:29,97 --> 00:07:37,2
narcotics in any culture. At the moment in australia and. Particularly in a culture where the other drugs.

89
00:07:37,2 --> 00:07:46,63
Such an integral part of the community. But the policing is the problem at the moment i think the policing in.

90
00:07:46,63 --> 00:07:53,28
The reason that the police want police name is a very simple one and that relates to their envy.

91
00:07:53,28 --> 00:08:01,37
Envy is a very basic human feeling like anger and avarice and sloth and the other seven deadly sins.

92
00:08:03,17 --> 00:08:12,07
Envy is ubiquitous. I personally feel that it was in v. That was the problem. On air con.

93
00:08:12,19 --> 00:08:14,33
In that might it impossible for us to share.

94
00:08:15,15 --> 00:08:22,04
I think it was not possible for some of the other people not to invade the why i could easily mike. Money.

95
00:08:22,96 --> 00:08:29,89
And that this. Distorted in all sorts of complicated whys the things that was going down.

96
00:08:30,16 --> 00:08:39,57
But i think the envy that the police. Feel for those of us that name is very very deep and very very profound.

97
00:08:39,57 --> 00:08:44,26
For the first few years when i had this wonderful relationship with the one policeman in town.

98
00:08:44,86 --> 00:08:47,47
I think that the situation was very very different.

99
00:08:48,45 --> 00:08:53,9
But then he actually left the town because he couldn't cope with just how ambiguous

100
00:08:53,9 --> 00:08:57,13
and complicated it was he was a lovely guy but he said himself.

101
00:08:57,13 --> 00:08:59,52
I can't go on with this amount of ambiguity

102
00:08:59,52 --> 00:09:04,35
and i doubt our my kids to be growing up in a drug plan like this i've got a god.

103
00:09:04,35 --> 00:09:14,26
And from then on we had a succession of policeman and police women. In various numbers coming there. Who i think.

104
00:09:14,26 --> 00:09:22,48
Really heighted name. My height and envy people like me. By height. And to some extent.

105
00:09:22,48 --> 00:09:29,98
Envy people who are on the dolls. And who can grow and to run a car on the dial.

106
00:09:29,98 --> 00:09:34,05
And live a pretty comfortable lifestyle.

107
00:09:34,05 --> 00:09:39,44
Not a wonderful lifestyle but the lifestyle of the average policeman with a mortgage and.

108
00:09:39,44 --> 00:09:41,9
All of those things is not all that bloody comfortable.

109
00:09:42,51 --> 00:09:51,1
Saw the side of a bunch of people on the dollar still driving a car and. Never working.

110
00:09:51,1 --> 00:09:59,88
The bunch of a the side of people like me who can cross the boundaries between. The professional.

111
00:09:59,88 --> 00:10:06,65
Groupings and the tribe out there and live a comfortable lifestyle in my view even drive a sports car.

112
00:10:06,65 --> 00:10:15,03
I think that the police a tremendously. Envious of. Most of the asp. Picts of the nieman phenomenon.

113
00:10:16,08 --> 00:10:25,32
Therefore i will not do what i would do in any other place when it comes to crime.

114
00:10:25,32 --> 00:10:29,22
I think i rather feel that we should steal an hour and sheet.

115
00:10:30,06 --> 00:10:36,43
Firstly that i can always justify their inactivity with respect to the hard drugs by saying i am

116
00:10:36,43 --> 00:10:43,3
but you just want us to bust the narcotics people. And ally off few dives micah's. And of course.

117
00:10:43,3 --> 00:10:50,4
That's not what a policeman is supposed to do. All right. We lie off the dogs muggers. But don't you expect us then.

118
00:10:50,4 --> 00:10:54,19
To be discriminating. That's not what a policeman is supposed to do.

119
00:10:54,19 --> 00:11:03,4
So they have a rational irrational rationalize i shun for going easy on the more obvious narcotic.

120
00:11:03,4 --> 00:11:11,61
Dealing and using the guys on in town. But that's just the rationale. What's behind it is to hype that place.

121
00:11:11,61 --> 00:11:18,05
By height. The in height of the intelligentsia the height. The artists.

122
00:11:18,05 --> 00:11:23,44
But that's not what a policeman is about policemen the not about the finer things in life policeman.

123
00:11:23,44 --> 00:11:28,15
By choice actually come into contact with some of the most disastrous human beings in the community

124
00:11:28,15 --> 00:11:32,8
and i've got a valve job. And i'm not sighing that their envy is unique.

125
00:11:32,8 --> 00:11:39,18
I've just said that envy i think fucked up my community. But i think that in this particular case.

126
00:11:39,18 --> 00:11:45,8
It is the envy of the police. That forces them into a particular level of activity.

127
00:11:45,8 --> 00:11:50,83
Which then ensures that we have a very special drug problem in name.

128
00:11:51,35 --> 00:11:57,33
And i will not police that town and i will not walk around that town. The police department.

129
00:11:57,33 --> 00:12:08,57
Will not put on and off police for them to just walk around the town. There's a certain sort of. Overt drug use.

130
00:12:08,57 --> 00:12:14,63
Which just couldn't happen. If there was a policeman walking. By bluefin doesn't have to even do anything.

131
00:12:14,63 --> 00:12:21,62
He just has to be there. Or she has to be there. So i want to do that in him and i just want.

132
00:12:21,62 --> 00:12:26,37
And i say well that's because we'd have to book the docks marcus but that's not the cause.

133
00:12:26,37 --> 00:12:30,33
Well firstly i wouldn't have to. And i could actually be discriminating.

134
00:12:30,33 --> 00:12:39,73
Policeman of discriminating all the time but i'd bust each other for speeding. So we're up against a team name.

135
00:12:39,73 --> 00:12:47,15
With the fact that the police are not giving us a fair deal about. Hard drug users. Just not policing it.

136
00:12:47,15 --> 00:12:52,13
And that's because i want to ask to steal an hour and cheat.

137
00:12:52,13 --> 00:13:19,36
Well i still don't think i can do it without the police cooperation.

138
00:13:19,62 --> 00:13:26,19
Yes it is true that we've never been able to draw a line survive never been able to draw lines in name one

139
00:13:26,19 --> 00:13:36,13
and the have all wise. Been in difficulty and finally deciding that x. Is gone too far. Unless it's. That x.

140
00:13:36,13 --> 00:13:41,21
Is gone too far in asserting some sort of leadership. If if x.

141
00:13:41,21 --> 00:13:46,88
Begins to assert something that might be interpreted as ladyship i've got the shit kicked out of the matey of late

142
00:13:46,88 --> 00:13:49,76
but if you go too far with respect to shooting in the middle of the mind straight

143
00:13:49,76 --> 00:13:55,96
or anything like that it would be very hard for naman to draw the line. So yes. Obviously enough.

144
00:13:55,96 --> 00:14:07,08
There's a potential for for serious. Illegal drug users to two pariah.

145
00:14:07,08 --> 00:14:13,54
Themselves in name been without getting the usual public condemnation. The. Might keep them in order.

146
00:14:13,54 --> 00:14:20,41
But i don't think that we could do anything in name in a map that problem unless the police actually kind plain.

147
00:14:20,41 --> 00:14:45,76
And the police applying it very dirty in the middle. Yeah now i'm not i'm not happy about.

148
00:14:45,76 --> 00:14:56,13
The why that continues to be a feature of nieman law. And it is the. I mean it's a movie again.

149
00:15:01,45 --> 00:15:07,95
Awful of the why in which leadership. Is dissolved dispersed. Denied.

150
00:15:07,95 --> 00:15:16,25
In name and is another real example of just what a very very important part in human affairs envy plies.

151
00:15:16,66 --> 00:15:21,62
Of course once again. There is a rationale for it in naman. You know.

152
00:15:21,62 --> 00:15:27,45
If everybody's to be free and autonomous and way to have a real anarchy then.

153
00:15:27,45 --> 00:15:34,43
Obviously enough now one should leave because i would have to impose their particular style on other people and.

154
00:15:34,43 --> 00:15:43,15
That is you know. Then the false. Rationale for. Tearing down leaders. It's in the.

155
00:15:43,15 --> 00:15:46,75
It's in the interests of anarchy and real autonomy.

156
00:15:46,75 --> 00:15:50,98
That we have to get rid of the sort of people who want to be leaderless

157
00:15:50,98 --> 00:15:55,9
but i've already said that i think that that's a disaster. And that's not ride.

158
00:15:55,9 --> 00:16:03,46
But i also believe that the tearing down of leaders. Is. You know the prime.

159
00:16:03,46 --> 00:16:12,07
The cardinal example of a strike is endemic. Of australians endemic envy.

160
00:16:12,84 --> 00:16:18,78
Which is which runs very deep in a horse tryon's might have something to do with our convict background or something.

161
00:16:18,78 --> 00:16:24,28
But i think it is. It's a bad thing it would be wonderful if we could i have a cow.

162
00:16:24,28 --> 00:16:30,51
And we would want to have a comment until we acknowledge just how many areas of life.

163
00:16:30,51 --> 00:16:37,67
Of our own personal lives and of our larger lives as a community. Until we acknowledge how deeply.

164
00:16:38,71 --> 00:16:49,94
Envy provides our community. So poor our name and has not managed to transit and. The problem that you know.

165
00:16:49,94 --> 00:16:55,9
I think bedevils all of a stride you. With respect to the toll poppy syndrome niman hasn't.

166
00:16:55,9 --> 00:17:03,86
Transcended that and simply because you know name been. Has interpreted anneke and. And freedom as.

167
00:17:03,86 --> 00:17:07,61
Maining they would not be and they would not need to be leaders.

168
00:17:07,61 --> 00:17:15,7
And i of course believe that's complete nonsense i think that we have to have inspirational human beings around us.

169
00:17:16,66 --> 00:17:27,23
In order to be inspired. And in order to write e ict light. Selves we need to be exposed to righty and. Beings.

170
00:17:27,69 --> 00:17:37,26
There have been a lot of people at nieman who are pretty righty and sort of creatures and i do get a pretty rough time.

171
00:17:46,72 --> 00:17:54,13
Yeah well. Yes. Yes. Matings have benefit share of. Naman.

172
00:17:54,6 --> 00:18:05,76
And i have taken the sime form from die one where anybody who attempted to take a real leadership role has come.

173
00:18:06,44 --> 00:18:14,22
Has come. Adrift. And where everybody. You know has the right to be heard. Good and.

174
00:18:14,22 --> 00:18:24,31
There are some aspects of that which i really appreciate i. I think that are actually on my.

175
00:18:24,31 --> 00:18:30,15
I'm not a member of the quietest but i am a quiet regular attender it. Quite amazing.

176
00:18:31,26 --> 00:18:41,75
And you mind that quite as were the. The first group of people to enshrine consensus. As.

177
00:18:41,75 --> 00:18:49,83
The most appropriate why of decision miking. Well i really do appreciate the fact that it name and there isn't a tame.

178
00:18:49,83 --> 00:18:58,69
All wise. To to find some sort of consensus in mating. Now of course just as with the quite as i mean.

179
00:18:58,69 --> 00:19:04,09
You're all nighters that you don't know many quite as they're not a very evangelical bunch and they're very quiet

180
00:19:04,09 --> 00:19:06,4
and very live profile and.

181
00:19:06,4 --> 00:19:10,73
Usually very beautiful people but it certainly isn't the movement that's taken over the world and.

182
00:19:10,73 --> 00:19:19,07
That is undoubtedly a consequence of their commitment to this. Fascinating process of consensus.

183
00:19:19,19 --> 00:19:22,89
And that's what everybody tries for all of the meetings in women.

184
00:19:22,89 --> 00:19:27,79
And just as the quiet is only of a tiger over the world there's no doubt that what it is that's happening at niman

185
00:19:27,79 --> 00:19:36,83
eleven dyck over the world because of their commitment to. Everybody being hood. And particularly everybody trying to.

186
00:19:38,11 --> 00:19:43,37
You know to come from their higher self in their communications with other people.

187
00:19:43,37 --> 00:19:55,22
But it does mane that you have to listen to some assholes and. That certainly you know. Bogs down the process.

188
00:19:56,61 --> 00:19:58,22
My pleasure and privilege.
