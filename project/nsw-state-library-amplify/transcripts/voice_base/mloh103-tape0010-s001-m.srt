1
00:00:17,15 --> 00:00:35,01
I bought a where it's twenty. Florist. Visioning. Is going to stop us.

2
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:46,66
I came up to name that and decide on such and you know. All right. All right. I'm florist a vision.

3
00:00:46,66 --> 00:00:54,48
When i lived in sydney. I was francesca. But since moving up here. I've decided that i like my name.

4
00:00:54,48 --> 00:01:10,12
To come back to me as a mantra. And soft call myself. Burgeon forest where i came to nimbin. India early eighties.

5
00:01:10,12 --> 00:01:16,74
For a three week holiday. And found myself having my first. Environmental arrest.

6
00:01:16,74 --> 00:01:34,25
And the amount of protecting the forest. Environment became an issue. From that point on it was a night.

7
00:01:34,25 --> 00:01:41,15
I didn't stay i actually had a very close connection with king's cross for ten years.

8
00:01:41,15 --> 00:01:45,46
And i was very fond of king's cross. So i had a double pole.

9
00:01:45,46 --> 00:01:51,75
In you came up here when he was five and fell in love with the place. So he kept pulling back.

10
00:01:51,75 --> 00:02:03,46
And so i kept a very close connection with people from the time when there were environmental. Activated. With me.

11
00:02:03,46 --> 00:02:15,75
And so over the years so close. Kept very close friendships and. It was no moon. Feeling to come and live up here.

12
00:02:15,75 --> 00:02:27,12
To run. When you got here a few years back. To help run the rainforest information center in liz mill.

13
00:02:27,12 --> 00:02:36,07
And i was there for about a year and a bit. And then i moved to living in teepees.

14
00:02:36,07 --> 00:02:45,69
I've decided that i had to get closer to the ground. Closer to where. Mother nature was suffering.

15
00:02:45,69 --> 00:02:52,03
And feeling what it is that we need to do. Really you know. We just asked directly.

16
00:02:52,03 --> 00:02:59,18
You environment what needs to be done and becomes really really very clear that certain things need to be done

17
00:02:59,18 --> 00:03:24,99
and you do them. You know what. I love for freedom. Is my motivating force. And i like to live in an environment where.

18
00:03:24,99 --> 00:03:33,14
I'm not closed in my best. Expression for the head is maybe the aboriginal way. The gun yeah.

19
00:03:33,14 --> 00:03:40,86
I had a gun you know which had no separation between inside and outside and. That is how i feel best.

20
00:03:40,86 --> 00:03:50,01
That's how i feel. I am living. To my utmost. I have rather than hiding away. You know. In a box. You know.

21
00:03:50,01 --> 00:03:59,64
In the house and. It feels like to pick a perfect thing for me to be doing. You know my body loves dancing.

22
00:03:59,64 --> 00:04:01,83
I can get into singing.

23
00:04:01,83 --> 00:04:13,02
I can do things that come much more spontaneously if you living in close connection with nature. What was.

24
00:04:17,17 --> 00:04:27,84
Knowing that the rain forest. Yes. I know that the rain forest. Is the womb of life and.

25
00:04:27,84 --> 00:04:34,28
There's only a few remnants left on the planet. In relation to what it was not so very long ago.

26
00:04:34,28 --> 00:04:41,07
So it is of the utmost importance that we protect these remnants and.

27
00:04:41,07 --> 00:04:48,33
Live when we live in close proximity with these remnants living totoo understanding of our environment.

28
00:04:48,33 --> 00:04:59,38
And the total connection with it. That is my inspiration is radio.

29
00:04:59,38 --> 00:05:17,11
So he actually had to straddle both worlds i lived in kings cross. For a lot of that time he's only been here.

30
00:05:17,11 --> 00:05:31,92
Proximity the same time as me. For most. K. Ok. Sorry about that but experience of it is all right. My son. Emu.

31
00:05:31,92 --> 00:05:40,77
Lived in kings cross for the first twelve years of his life and. He only had certain times away from case cross.

32
00:05:40,77 --> 00:05:50,01
Appear. But that was enough for him to become an environmentalist. And he has gone to america on his own twice.

33
00:05:50,01 --> 00:06:10,69
To sing from coast to coast. Environmental songs. And so. He keeps coming back to this place. This place. He lives. So.

34
00:06:10,69 --> 00:06:24,36
Yes education. He went to preschool. The brush cut his buy a ride on the water's edge.

35
00:06:24,36 --> 00:06:30,04
Because that was the healthiest place for him to be. He's living in kings cross. And he loved it.

36
00:06:30,04 --> 00:06:36,6
And he stay they want to extreme here. So that. He started school. One year late.

37
00:06:36,6 --> 00:06:48,46
And then he went to a lera demonstration school which was a school in the richmond suburbs a gang and.

38
00:06:48,46 --> 00:06:57,87
It had a good effect on amy or in go ahead. Three mile teaches through his primary school. And he was able to relate.

39
00:06:57,87 --> 00:07:08,86
For many hours a day with a mild which was great because he was being brought up by me and.

40
00:07:08,86 --> 00:07:18,52
When he left when he left sydney. At the age of twelve. In your time and schooling. He'd made it to go clews boys high.

41
00:07:18,52 --> 00:07:29,18
But we just went. Submerged and. He didn't emerge again. Tried one term at high school when he was fifteen.

42
00:07:29,18 --> 00:07:40,8
And he didn't find it very inspiring. So he went on the hill and kohli caught. Bandwagon he used to sing.

43
00:07:40,8 --> 00:07:51,21
When she spoke in her election campaign and. That's what he's chosen to do. He's just a musician.

44
00:07:51,21 --> 00:08:05,32
Expressing what's happening around his sets. He's just because he's rich.

45
00:08:05,32 --> 00:08:13,02
His education is so far ahead of anything that. The education system can possibly provide that. It just.

46
00:08:13,67 --> 00:08:25,28
It just defies all curricula.

47
00:08:25,28 --> 00:08:51,62
So it shows you know that there isn't a name than you find when you dance with the name been people.

48
00:08:51,62 --> 00:09:01,04
And don't exchange. Any words. You feel such high regard for them. You feel such a powerful. Bonding.

49
00:09:01,04 --> 00:09:06,05
And then when you actually do exchange words. Then mostly good words.

50
00:09:06,05 --> 00:09:11,99
And people have feeling for one another they recognize each other's right to exist.

51
00:09:11,99 --> 00:09:38,28
And credibly even tolerant and have a trifle less fear than most people out there like that so i'm not he was my first.

52
00:09:38,28 --> 00:09:46,59
Connection. And now tonight is just so beautiful. The forest in there is just so magnificent.

53
00:09:46,59 --> 00:09:53,65
And my first connection to this place was that i stayed in a wooden dome. It was like a small cathedral.

54
00:09:53,65 --> 00:10:07,3
It was just so beautiful so well placed and build with love and feeling. It's a great place. This.

55
00:10:07,3 --> 00:10:16,32
Couldn't help but live. As an icon in my in my living in sydney. I could always look back to this and say well.

56
00:10:16,32 --> 00:10:46,73
This exists. The ones that see the forest. Is for me letting go. Thinking of myself as the center of the universe and.

57
00:10:46,73 --> 00:11:05,53
Just becoming pattern. And amazing array. Creatures. Smell just. The song. Lizards. Snakes.

58
00:11:05,53 --> 00:11:28,03
I just love being spiritual. Yes. Sometimes i will kilometers. Through the night with no moon and.

59
00:11:28,03 --> 00:11:54,46
I just rolled through this truly magical place has lost its just a kind of.

60
00:11:54,46 --> 00:11:58,92
I think the religious was call it a calling. For me.

61
00:11:58,92 --> 00:12:13,02
It's just down the way he's going down to the world a whole lot say. Oh yes that's good.

62
00:12:15,99 --> 00:12:27,68
It's a taking responsibility and enjoying your life. Enjoying your life.

63
00:12:27,68 --> 00:12:34,99
Doing things that you know you should be doing. And getting a lot of joy in creating out of the creativity.

64
00:12:34,99 --> 00:12:49,19
I'm doing a little poem a culture hillside with bush has made. And love you close down at the bottom with frog song.

65
00:12:49,19 --> 00:13:04,81
Every night. By an empty theater. With frogs. About tens of righties. Just to sing the song. Night for.

66
00:13:04,81 --> 00:13:13,72
It's the kind of thing that he could only have a few little love. And you're prepared to protect my secret.

67
00:13:13,72 --> 00:13:39,17
So that's the attitude i have is that. I'm still in the dog and. I give massage twice a week.

68
00:13:39,17 --> 00:13:50,45
Mondays and fridays union. I do something from. Esoteric knowledge of osteopathy. And she asked sue.

69
00:13:50,45 --> 00:13:56,82
And i use my entire body for delivery. My feet. My smile bows and.

70
00:13:56,82 --> 00:14:04,99
I bring a lot of structural change in people's bodies. And i really enjoy doing that.

71
00:14:04,99 --> 00:14:13,02
I'm more concerned with moving away from the attitude of money being really important. I am more concerned.

72
00:14:13,12 --> 00:14:24,2
And with people actually prove. Starting to produce food and produce their own food. That i think is most central.

73
00:14:24,2 --> 00:14:52,69
To focus upon. You know food production. Able to sustain itself. So it's been a rural subsidy. Most said yes.

74
00:14:52,69 --> 00:15:04,42
Can you can i stay here. Yeah. The goal is to create a rule subsidy and.

75
00:15:04,42 --> 00:15:09,49
Give people an opportunity to branch out and start something totally fresh and new.

76
00:15:09,49 --> 00:15:18,42
And that's the promise of aquarius aquarius is the promise of. Fresh approach to same and.

77
00:15:18,42 --> 00:15:26,36
That's what the fist book is going to be showing. It has to show that. Otherwise there's absolutely no hope.

78
00:15:26,36 --> 00:15:31,42
It has to be a new way of doing things.

79
00:15:31,42 --> 00:15:38,09
We've had so many wars in close connection with one another we haven't had a new listing period between generations in

80
00:15:38,09 --> 00:15:44,1
peace. So our brains are a bit scrambled. If you go to the age and you need to kill.

81
00:15:44,1 --> 00:15:49,96
You need at least four generations. To recover. Priest psyche to recover.

82
00:15:49,96 --> 00:16:13,02
So if we can find a health and well being in the rainforest. Not going to find it anyway. You know it's best. So yeah.

83
00:16:15,25 --> 00:16:23,9
We have. At the drop of a hat we celebrate. Celebrate. Anything and everything and.

84
00:16:23,9 --> 00:16:34,13
We have minister for cultural affairs and. He ensures a healthy. Number of dances and get togethers and.

85
00:16:34,13 --> 00:17:00,85
Places for displaying. Just what. Yes yes yes yes yes we kind of here together. And we want to have a good time yet.

86
00:17:00,85 --> 00:17:11,86
This is such a beautiful planet. It's such a mistake to have anything else other than a very good time for.
