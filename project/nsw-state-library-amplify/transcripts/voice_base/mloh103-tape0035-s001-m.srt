1
00:00:13,08 --> 00:00:31,08
Ok three things. Universities big cultural reasons. Sure. Fifty seven.

2
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:32,49
And i work at the university of sydney

3
00:00:32,49 --> 00:00:38,87
and i've been here for about fifteen years still doing a lot of the things that i did when the.

4
00:00:38,87 --> 00:00:44,59
Prodigy queries festival. I was tutoring here and a university of new south wiles.

5
00:00:44,59 --> 00:00:51,87
And was more involvement with students who were also interested in the audiology is that in the protest

6
00:00:51,87 --> 00:00:58,76
and the radical movements of that time. And who desperately wanted to be involved in exploring some of those paths.

7
00:00:58,76 --> 00:01:00,04
And it was through that.

8
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:08,49
University commitment and the fact that the aquarius festival was destroyed and you know students.

9
00:01:08,49 --> 00:01:15,95
Event that we could quite legitimately get involved in i was capable because i worked also at new south wilds of

10
00:01:15,95 --> 00:01:23,88
involving the students architecture students at both universities. And i was very keen. I didn't have to do too much.

11
00:01:23,88 --> 00:01:29,59
And there was a solid group of students from yourself wiles' and from sydney who got involved in the planning.

12
00:01:29,59 --> 00:01:39,00
And in the construction of. Some of the facilities. For the festival. But prior to that i can recall.

13
00:01:39,00 --> 00:01:46,08
Very early in the post might be a year or two year and a half perhaps before the festival started being approached boy.

14
00:01:46,08 --> 00:01:48,3
Johnny alan johnston.

15
00:01:48,3 --> 00:01:54,15
And i can recall my first meeting with him on you john any wife from the yellow house at king's cross.

16
00:01:54,15 --> 00:02:02,00
But we had a meeting at my office at the time which was in the by create. Paddington and.

17
00:02:02,00 --> 00:02:06,11
We were talking about the festival and.

18
00:02:06,11 --> 00:02:12,79
How it might be set up and where it will be set up and about some of the ideas that much more.

19
00:02:13,02 --> 00:02:18,19
Be brought to bear on it. And i remember at that stage.

20
00:02:18,19 --> 00:02:25,8
I think it was graham dunstan was saying that by them were attracted to the area around mullumbimby

21
00:02:25,8 --> 00:02:33,89
but for various reasons. It might not mine or the coup there. But that general region which.

22
00:02:33,89 --> 00:02:41,56
I forget who coined the word ride by region but. It was that region that we were talking about. And i can remember.

23
00:02:41,56 --> 00:02:44,19
Advancing. The idea.

24
00:02:44,19 --> 00:02:53,88
Since all working to try and have a larger agenda for the festival to help with the day centralization movement.

25
00:02:53,88 --> 00:02:57,74
Because i had just done a job for the department as centralized.

26
00:02:57,74 --> 00:03:04,46
Through the university of new england called my client where i'd had a lot of contact with local towns playbill

27
00:03:04,46 --> 00:03:12,63
and also in the district. And i was very sad about the fact that they kids were leaving and going to the city and.

28
00:03:12,63 --> 00:03:20,83
Not continuing the role tradition. And the townspeople also very kind to attract. Development.

29
00:03:20,83 --> 00:03:29,52
Looking at their town declining and the population declining and very worried about about the future and.

30
00:03:29,52 --> 00:03:35,71
What i was there for was to help sort of plan a strategy for the future of this. I was very conscious of that.

31
00:03:35,71 --> 00:03:43,03
And i remember realizing this to. Johnny and sighing that. There was this problem of a.

32
00:03:43,03 --> 00:03:48,85
Of a concentration of population. Moving to the big cities. And the rural areas.

33
00:03:48,85 --> 00:03:57,82
Hadn't been able to attract new settlements or. Business like new rule developments.

34
00:03:57,82 --> 00:04:03,79
And it was a non-factor that the north coast in particular the dairy industry was declining and.

35
00:04:03,79 --> 00:04:09,26
No matter how much funding. The department of decentralization injected into it didn't say interest that decline.

36
00:04:09,73 --> 00:04:17,63
So we were trying to look at a bigger picture. As well as. Being a festival and enjoying the fruits of that.

37
00:04:17,63 --> 00:04:22,55
And it was all sides. From our point of view. University.

38
00:04:22,55 --> 00:04:31,98
Involvement was a grant to try some experiments and to say what would work. Well.

39
00:04:31,98 --> 00:04:40,26
I can remember being in name but being in. I think we all we met up at least.

40
00:04:40,26 --> 00:04:48,23
And i think it was tom zubrycki had a cat. And there were four of us. There including tom and joy and myself.

41
00:04:48,23 --> 00:04:49,46
And with author.

42
00:04:49,46 --> 00:04:53,96
We were cruising the area looking for inspiration and sots

43
00:04:53,96 --> 00:05:02,57
and i think brian in particular was very keen finding something like a wilderness area like a wonderful place to be.

44
00:05:02,57 --> 00:05:11,17
And to have a festival and in a fairly unfitted why try out a lot of new systems.

45
00:05:11,17 --> 00:05:15,19
And so i suppose we were looking for a special saw it.

46
00:05:15,19 --> 00:05:20,98
And we none of us would talk seriously about recycling in a town at that age.

47
00:05:20,98 --> 00:05:28,3
And or remember when we first saw it in the name of rocks. It was such a powerful impact. That everybody just said.

48
00:05:28,3 --> 00:05:31,06
You know. Wow. This has to be.

49
00:05:31,06 --> 00:05:32,27
The saw it somewhere around here

50
00:05:32,27 --> 00:05:40,14
and i think the first instinct was to say let's have a festival at the foothills of the rocks.

51
00:05:40,14 --> 00:05:44,79
Not knowing of its aboriginal significance or anything else other than the fact that was just a very powerful place.

52
00:05:44,79 --> 00:05:51,97
But we continued on and to explore around and around the place and. Then we found.

53
00:05:51,97 --> 00:05:59,62
The way when we came into the town and it was village it was. It was a client in a sense in that.

54
00:05:59,62 --> 00:06:04,02
It was almost a mean conditioned. Village with. There's only one shop.

55
00:06:04,02 --> 00:06:16,36
A lot of very little action in the story and anyone around. And i can recall then sighing. This is the place.

56
00:06:16,36 --> 00:06:22,92
And i said. What was the connection between this. Almost a film set. Village.

57
00:06:22,92 --> 00:06:30,26
And the name but it rocks that created that sort of.

58
00:06:30,26 --> 00:06:39,03
Then i should let you know we found the place and now we should sort of concentrate on what to do with it.

59
00:06:39,03 --> 00:06:45,71
I think what the sequence of events after that was that by simply that. One of the things that.

60
00:06:45,71 --> 00:06:52,76
Having just done the out town axis i was very conscious of. Participating with like a playful and.

61
00:06:52,76 --> 00:06:57,35
I did suggest that before we did. Too much else we should have a meeting with the town.

62
00:06:57,35 --> 00:07:03,61
And set up a meeting and start to negotiate with or in fact the town player wanted just here.

63
00:07:03,61 --> 00:07:07,64
But i feel sure i would because of that background of.

64
00:07:07,64 --> 00:07:13,08
Involving and wanting to involve young people in rural values and.

65
00:07:13,08 --> 00:07:17,16
The opportunity to start new laws and i think that the townspeople

66
00:07:17,16 --> 00:07:24,52
and the organizers of the conference had had a lot of common ground. And i actually wasn't there when that.

67
00:07:24,52 --> 00:07:38,92
When those meetings occurred. I had. I went off to china for educational visit you know matings before i went.

68
00:07:39,36 --> 00:07:47,69
We did talk about whether it should be a will or sought. Or whether it should be. What i was.

69
00:07:47,69 --> 00:07:54,36
Opting for which was a degree i did saw it. Like a place where the impact of having. X. Thousand.

70
00:07:54,36 --> 00:07:59,54
Number of people for a couple of weeks. Wouldn't wouldn't destroy the saw.

71
00:07:59,54 --> 00:08:10,85
And i was very conscious of the fact that the impact of having been to other events. Like that and.

72
00:08:10,85 --> 00:08:17,01
What i do remember and several others i was. Way that. You know there was a. There was a terrific.

73
00:08:17,01 --> 00:08:26,53
Potential impact of so many people and. The idea of finding sots close to the town to sort of.

74
00:08:26,53 --> 00:08:29,59
Close to the village to breathe life into the plies

75
00:08:29,59 --> 00:08:34,58
and the fact that there was already a transport connection the lismore there was already some.

76
00:08:34,58 --> 00:08:42,25
Lots of viking shops and one shop. But there were facilities there that could very good eye. The idea of a festival.

77
00:08:42,25 --> 00:08:48,34
And without having to put all the expensive infrastructure because there was a budget repub many why about bringing in

78
00:08:48,34 --> 00:08:56,00
water and handling transport and also controlling it i mean there's a play station if they felt that that was a fact

79
00:08:56,00 --> 00:09:05,47
but there's a hospital. And things like that which in the event. You know useful things to have around.

80
00:09:05,47 --> 00:09:12,7
So it more or less settled down that. Now we wouldn't get out of the rocks. Naman rocks.

81
00:09:12,7 --> 00:09:20,56
I don't think that so it was might have been anyway. And i don't know or didn't.

82
00:09:20,56 --> 00:09:22,02
As to whether we could use that sought

83
00:09:22,02 --> 00:09:29,73
but we did talk very seriously with the honors of the saw its closest to the mine straight of name and. One of whom.

84
00:09:29,73 --> 00:09:35,3
Acquiesced to to letting us use the saw and the other one didn't. So most of our planning work.

85
00:09:35,3 --> 00:09:44,26
Was concentrated on the site where the festival actually you could and. The auditor of the street being part of the.

86
00:09:44,26 --> 00:10:01,69
The festival was actually. Indorsed by the. By the local the local people. Sure the general idea of recycling.

87
00:10:01,69 --> 00:10:03,8
Was very strong.

88
00:10:03,8 --> 00:10:09,1
And we would talk about recycling all sorts of things i mean i wanted to actually jump the skylab to a cycling a town

89
00:10:09,1 --> 00:10:19,02
but. It was a natural extension of. Risotto. Weissmann resorting building materials or recycling anything. I mean.

90
00:10:19,02 --> 00:10:24,66
Rather than putting energy into new products. I mean that was very much part of the audiology.

91
00:10:24,66 --> 00:10:31,67
And that found for me but the audio of recycling a town and not building a lot of stuff that was already there.

92
00:10:31,67 --> 00:10:37,89
There was a lot of interesting. Things like solar energy. I mean what.

93
00:10:37,89 --> 00:10:42,97
What in fact is probably now one of the same does of cell he found a splice in him

94
00:10:42,97 --> 00:10:48,35
and there was a lot of the stuff that came out of the whole earth catalog

95
00:10:48,35 --> 00:10:53,12
and the thinking that kind of out of there people were very anxious to explore.

96
00:10:53,12 --> 00:10:59,75
Like building their own structures minimally. And in fact. It was a venue.

97
00:10:59,75 --> 00:11:05,96
Most people who kind the kind with the idea of building. New sorts of structures.

98
00:11:05,96 --> 00:11:14,01
You know also ideas about using weist just as and things like that.

99
00:11:14,01 --> 00:11:23,29
To handle sewage and that sort of once were there was intense interest in vegetarianism and new why's of of cooking.

100
00:11:23,29 --> 00:11:28,91
And also eating different sort of products. Starting.

101
00:11:28,91 --> 00:11:43,8
There was a growing interest in soybeans and many things like that it's cheeses and. And also in fruit. You know.

102
00:11:43,8 --> 00:11:50,1
There was it was no accident people used to cite people would run they would agree and. If i says.

103
00:11:50,1 --> 00:11:56,93
And it's no accident that they write about kefaya they started up a sort of a very old. You know.

104
00:11:56,93 --> 00:12:03,52
A challenging sort of food venue that appealed to a lot of people specially was opposite the hotel i mean there was a

105
00:12:03,52 --> 00:12:09,98
there was a mindstream. Culture going on one saw the straight with. Hamburgers and beer and there was another culture.

106
00:12:09,98 --> 00:12:16,33
Did opposite. Going for soya burgers and. Going to and things like that.

107
00:12:16,33 --> 00:12:19,72
But from our point of view i mean i was a planner and an architect and.

108
00:12:19,72 --> 00:12:28,58
I was very interested in my students and being involved in designing and constructing the facilities.

109
00:12:28,58 --> 00:12:37,48
So we actually part of the idea was to design. And does ignite. The camping areas and the can.

110
00:12:37,48 --> 00:12:46,33
And the facilities areas. The systems. Which would at least mine tie and several thousand people for a couple of.

111
00:12:46,33 --> 00:12:53,3
Couple of weeks. And we did that and especially with the sort of. Was after claude in that for god.

112
00:12:53,3 --> 00:13:00,6
And then he was the one who. By sickly other endorsed the ideas or challenge them and and.

113
00:13:00,6 --> 00:13:07,3
You know we did other things but. We did have a lot of contact our member with the. Strangely helpful.

114
00:13:07,3 --> 00:13:16,14
In how to handle that many people on friday. Sots. And we also had a lot of contact with the.

115
00:13:16,14 --> 00:13:25,06
Start emergency services in. And we had many many but he's with the logical. With the shark council.

116
00:13:25,06 --> 00:13:28,41
Because ultimately i suppose the side of the service

117
00:13:28,41 --> 00:13:32,98
and the i mean if it was necessary lot of gotten involved somewhere along the line.

118
00:13:32,98 --> 00:13:37,39
But as far as the services with them so i had a health priority.

119
00:13:37,39 --> 00:13:48,16
And a responsibility for health and we were conscious of that. So we did opt for. Pit toilets as being the best option.

120
00:13:48,16 --> 00:13:58,98
And we had the electricity authority come in and big the big. I did post halls bicycling. But in the sense that.

121
00:13:58,98 --> 00:14:06,87
Pit toilets actually. Was sort of crude recycling sewage because wherever the pit toilets were we had planned.

122
00:14:06,87 --> 00:14:14,62
An orchard to talk and supplies. What was revolutionary i think was that the pit toilets were. Well communal.

123
00:14:14,62 --> 00:14:25,05
And i was six. They were the one one of memories is a group of people sitting in a circle.

124
00:14:25,05 --> 00:14:36,44
Having a crap and having a good time to go to extraordinary things like privacy and. Modesty just. Blot out the window.

125
00:14:36,44 --> 00:14:38,77
By side when we planned them we did have.

126
00:14:38,77 --> 00:14:48,16
We did have them in circles but we had a bit of previous here in full camping gear is the priority was given to.

127
00:14:48,16 --> 00:14:53,76
Community facilities like there was a health. Like a hospital. Place for emergencies.

128
00:14:53,76 --> 00:15:00,36
You know places where cooking was done and. Where there was access to the creek water.

129
00:15:00,58 --> 00:15:07,49
The sots for the camping the will a wife in the creek were very conscious of the fact that people could.

130
00:15:07,49 --> 00:15:13,03
Pollute the groundwater very easily. So where they where the pitch would not go.

131
00:15:13,03 --> 00:15:21,48
We were careful not to penetrate the border title. That would have contributed and. We used a lot of materials like.

132
00:15:21,48 --> 00:15:28,88
Parachutes and powers and like the toilets themselves were just haitian and posts and.

133
00:15:28,88 --> 00:15:40,48
Pits and pans that came in squatting. Toilets were very fashionable and. We. We did a lot of. We built a lot of.

134
00:15:40,48 --> 00:15:44,36
Footprint talk about squatting toilets. So when you went to the toilet.

135
00:15:44,36 --> 00:15:53,05
You had an option of a squat or a pain in the water system we just by simply. We did collect water off.

136
00:15:53,05 --> 00:15:55,58
Rooms where we could we could do it.

137
00:15:55,58 --> 00:16:02,05
But we relied on town water and also the creek from cooking

138
00:16:02,05 --> 00:16:10,91
and other places was put into selling to people that were dying and. The general to. Planning of the.

139
00:16:10,91 --> 00:16:15,84
Of the festival days ignited. Packing in. Areas and places where people like. Checkpoints.

140
00:16:15,84 --> 00:16:17,61
People when i come into town.

141
00:16:17,61 --> 00:16:33,73
Will come out of the camping sots head entrance and things like that were very interesting. With a lot of people.

142
00:16:33,73 --> 00:16:43,39
Nor was a matter of if it into the. Like was almost like a display village teepees. Lot of bamboo.

143
00:16:43,39 --> 00:16:45,28
Because people found bamboo in the range

144
00:16:45,28 --> 00:16:56,88
and i persuaded some families to let him have a lot of natural materials people did. With brick. Construction.

145
00:16:56,88 --> 00:17:01,44
The five materials with natural materials. Just a side. Or restocking materials.

146
00:17:01,44 --> 00:17:10,62
Like people building things out of all remember one. Geodesic structure was built out of.

147
00:17:10,62 --> 00:17:18,54
I think it's stunning to me a bit of something like that. The northern style throughout all the printing plights.

148
00:17:18,54 --> 00:17:28,48
Someone fat to use well i could actually put it together. I had a. Unusual looking. Structure. But tents of course and.

149
00:17:28,48 --> 00:17:31,08
Caravans wheel structures.

150
00:17:31,08 --> 00:17:36,66
But the most extraordinary ones i think were normal spans done in bamboo using geodesic principles.

151
00:17:40,89 --> 00:17:48,22
One of the things that they helped us with. I set us up with would not have been emergency services.

152
00:17:48,22 --> 00:17:55,05
Set us up with a telephone. Wallace telephone system which.

153
00:17:55,05 --> 00:18:01,29
Some of the students got involved in being more or less like like a foreman is on a billing job and.

154
00:18:01,29 --> 00:18:09,73
There was a couple of really good. Women students that started to do all of that sort of sought work.

155
00:18:09,73 --> 00:18:20,84
And the students were deployed into. You know. Well that i haven't. I do remember now. I think there was a very loud.

156
00:18:20,84 --> 00:18:28,61
Like and a number of supporters. Had moved into me but and were living there.

157
00:18:28,61 --> 00:18:32,87
And no recall that i was good at that very sad because i didn't make anything was going to happen

158
00:18:32,87 --> 00:18:36,33
and i want to log on saw it now and. And then.

159
00:18:36,33 --> 00:18:43,06
We all went up on a on a big boss like the how a lot of us we had a boss.

160
00:18:43,06 --> 00:18:50,8
Where often even in the middle of the not knowing who was in the middle of the know what it was that they did a time.

161
00:18:51,1 --> 00:18:55,53
And we just arrived in the mindset of nimble and grime and.

162
00:18:55,53 --> 00:19:04,04
A few other people who were eating in the diocese kefaya which was the one that was just suddenly this injection of

163
00:19:04,04 --> 00:19:10,82
energy like just the numbers of people who are committed and that sort of thing. Just started to fall off and.

164
00:19:10,82 --> 00:19:24,3
So we moved out of the sots and started work and. That must have been about four weeks before the thing started. But.

165
00:19:24,3 --> 00:19:29,41
I mean it was good. Good for students good for us and. The systems. You know either primitive.

166
00:19:29,41 --> 00:19:36,54
But i worked there when i would hope that prices over there were health problems people didn't get sick.

167
00:19:36,54 --> 00:19:45,12
And there were some problems but i would miss it i mean. Coping with that amount of people.

168
00:19:45,12 --> 00:19:46,7
And the council were basically happy

169
00:19:46,7 --> 00:19:53,69
and then he moved as he started marriages he people didn't get involved the abbey road called in the cup as part of few

170
00:19:53,69 --> 00:20:04,19
visits but generally speaking. The place would accept i mean a lot of people were experimented with.

171
00:20:04,19 --> 00:20:11,53
Knocking down a lot of any bishan is and whilst the townspeople had welcomed. The idea. When the actual thing occurred.

172
00:20:11,53 --> 00:20:12,79
I mean that we're confronted with.

173
00:20:13,16 --> 00:20:20,07
Extraordinary assault on their senses and of their own ideas about modesty and privacy and.

174
00:20:20,07 --> 00:20:29,09
Drugs and all sorts of things so i thought it was just extraordinary the. The battering that. I think.

175
00:20:29,09 --> 00:20:40,39
But like what i wanted by simply. I got thousands of people. I had a credible injection of funds and energy and.

176
00:20:40,39 --> 00:20:53,84
Into the place. And the first it was i was involved in setting up the afternoon but what. Writings because we had been.

177
00:20:53,84 --> 00:20:56,98
We had realized during the course of the festival that.

178
00:20:56,98 --> 00:21:00,05
You know a lot of people are getting very committed to staying there.

179
00:21:00,05 --> 00:21:06,01
And we're quite anxious to try and purchased some properties to to mike sure that we you know.

180
00:21:06,01 --> 00:21:09,61
We were going to get there

181
00:21:09,61 --> 00:21:14,35
and some people didn't know that the tomato sauce spilling was a part of there were some other prop provide i kept

182
00:21:14,35 --> 00:21:21,84
and things like that were a quad and. I think and title for us was a call.

183
00:21:21,84 --> 00:21:31,01
So that's really where terry my kind of prominence. And then he gradually took over those matings and.

184
00:21:31,01 --> 00:21:38,64
The running really was all the people. When waltz. As a planet always interested in the afternoon but what our idea.

185
00:21:38,64 --> 00:21:43,6
And certainly wanted to help facilitate. What i'd go into the thing.

186
00:21:43,6 --> 00:21:51,55
Believing that he was something that they central out was actually decentralized it was happening it was about lost all

187
00:21:51,55 --> 00:21:56,92
it wasn't about industry or anything else it was about people wanting a different life.

188
00:21:56,92 --> 00:22:04,37
But the people who form the core groups of the afternoon that want meetings.

189
00:22:04,37 --> 00:22:12,79
Actually with a core group that then put a purchased title for and and set up for the ride i can't.

190
00:22:13,89 --> 00:22:20,59
Started tomato sauce is a sort of a drop in center. That eventually got involved in schooling.

191
00:22:20,59 --> 00:22:41,81
In the birthing center in the media center. And even what is what it is now. That. Oh yeah.

192
00:22:41,81 --> 00:22:46,3
I mean at the time i was living with a bunch of other people in a castle crag right on the waterfront.

193
00:22:46,3 --> 00:22:51,85
I mean it was it took a half an hour to get there because it was a two hundred foot cliff.

194
00:22:51,85 --> 00:22:57,94
You had to climb up and down. And it was one of those sort of left out of places but no ideally i mean.

195
00:22:57,94 --> 00:23:03,11
I had found nothing that would have compared with the lifestyle. There and we had a wonderful time.

196
00:23:03,11 --> 00:23:12,76
We had a killing and. We had a pool and. We had gardens and as far as i was concerned we were doing it anyway.

197
00:23:12,76 --> 00:23:21,27
But i must say that. When my mother died which is around that time or inherited a little bit of money.

198
00:23:21,27 --> 00:23:28,81
And i went off and. I bought a property on the whole screen river which was my that was my.

199
00:23:28,81 --> 00:23:35,04
Move to decentralize and i guess a lot of people are worried about nuclear war things like that and.

200
00:23:35,04 --> 00:23:45,29
I was certainly very interested in autonomy. And. There's two things i did one was to set a found a derelict owl.

201
00:23:45,29 --> 00:23:49,7
Hass on the hawkesbury which. Got students involved earlier.

202
00:23:49,7 --> 00:23:55,19
We had a commune there and we actually started to fix up the house and. The gardens.

203
00:23:55,19 --> 00:24:01,73
And that moved towards self-sufficiency and. I still enjoyed teaching and.

204
00:24:01,73 --> 00:24:07,17
One of the things we did at the university was build the autonomous house which was built entirely out of recycled

205
00:24:07,17 --> 00:24:15,7
materials. And that had solid water had a cellar a conditioning system. And there may find a jester and.

206
00:24:15,7 --> 00:24:20,93
A society out of gardens and. Several of the students lived there for four years out of the university.

207
00:24:23,13 --> 00:24:28,41
One of those to get rid of it and win it but of of that we get it up in the first place but it's lasted for four years.

208
00:24:29,24 --> 00:24:34,21
Let it ring general ryder's i mean it was extraordinary.

209
00:24:34,21 --> 00:24:40,26
I saw it on a campus that was full of brick and concrete buildings to fall on this.

210
00:24:40,26 --> 00:24:44,4
What the vice chancellor called a federalist house.

211
00:24:44,4 --> 00:24:52,5
Sit in this bit of ground that actually started to turn into those wonderful god. And we had four. Fairs.

212
00:24:52,5 --> 00:24:59,95
Which were free and. People used to come in and display what i really think that was alternatives which was fair guy.

213
00:25:00,56 --> 00:25:08,61
And that's where bill mollison started i mean he came to this one of the first venues that he got involved in there yes.

214
00:25:08,61 --> 00:25:14,51
There are lots of aboriginal groups and put up and normal.

215
00:25:14,51 --> 00:25:21,41
Structure where of course we experimented with recycling systems and solar energy and.

216
00:25:21,41 --> 00:25:26,09
There's a jesus and a lot of god has got involved in the university of new south wales come over

217
00:25:26,09 --> 00:25:33,84
and build a mud brick oven broadwood wood and. I mean it was that it was. Become a focal point for a lot of.

218
00:25:33,84 --> 00:25:42,23
The question had a solid core and that lots of. I mean it became a place where people could. You know.

219
00:25:42,23 --> 00:25:48,36
Share their ideas to other people and before fairs were really very very successful.

220
00:25:48,36 --> 00:25:55,43
When we ran out of gas after four tours there was nothing more we could science was also.

221
00:25:55,43 --> 00:25:59,92
We got a bit worried about the people who are involved in setting up the house that.

222
00:25:59,92 --> 00:26:04,71
Here we were setting up an absolute. Autonomous system.

223
00:26:04,71 --> 00:26:10,86
Within the middle of a huge city that had all these systems in place and we thought it was a bit.

224
00:26:10,86 --> 00:26:12,79
Bit of an anachronism. Actually doing.

225
00:26:14,94 --> 00:26:22,35
And what we kind the conclusion that it wasn't a system is it wasn't that our pricing wasn't guarded naman

226
00:26:22,35 --> 00:26:25,8
or the holy spirit. Or castle crab or anything else.

227
00:26:25,8 --> 00:26:30,46
What was fundamental to what we were on a bat was actually the chinese of attitude.

228
00:26:30,46 --> 00:26:37,73
And the china engine of personal lifestyle. And a commitment to. You know.

229
00:26:37,73 --> 00:26:40,48
Being aware globally and acting like really you know that slogan.

230
00:26:40,48 --> 00:26:43,87
Was around at the time and it didn't matter with me i mean.

231
00:26:43,87 --> 00:26:50,35
We didn't think it was mattered that we weren't living in a minority or else the fact was that we were challenging.

232
00:26:50,35 --> 00:26:55,35
The system and we were being personally responsible for what we did. And we're altering our lifestyle.

233
00:26:55,35 --> 00:27:00,74
Like we're being conscious about not why sting and we're conscious about not trying things out.

234
00:27:00,74 --> 00:27:20,19
And we are committed to working on systems and. Lies of building that you know what you'd now call societal.

235
00:27:20,19 --> 00:27:29,15
Used to get a bit pissed off that the audience was when i had ideas

236
00:27:29,15 --> 00:27:33,59
or what we thought where it is i'd probably that would our ideas but anyway.

237
00:27:34,16 --> 00:27:37,95
We got a bit disturbed by mindstream culture.

238
00:27:37,95 --> 00:27:44,85
Sometimes adapted them in a classic point was we done a lot of work on solid water collectors with a guy called

239
00:27:44,85 --> 00:27:57,09
marketing who had a fascinating idea about parabolic reflector. And we set up a cheap. Recycled version of that.

240
00:27:57,09 --> 00:28:04,82
And then along comes the hot and produce a system which we for thought was really inferior.

241
00:28:04,82 --> 00:28:10,16
I mean it was using materials that were and. That would energy efficient.

242
00:28:10,16 --> 00:28:14,81
Whereas they'd been firms like baisley for example in south astride. I've been doing.

243
00:28:14,81 --> 00:28:20,85
Systems for years and i've been up in the not in thirty's but. You know i had never caught on.

244
00:28:20,85 --> 00:28:29,51
When i had like gangbusters and i produced these heavy systems that set on roofs where the. And i worked and.

245
00:28:29,51 --> 00:28:35,79
The public bought them. And i feel good about them. I mean i don't think i alter their lifestyle one inch.

246
00:28:36,81 --> 00:28:45,14
But they still continue to use more water than i had to do. And i still have no electric backup systems.

247
00:28:45,23 --> 00:28:51,17
So yeah i did feel a bit upset about that. But i don't now.

248
00:28:51,17 --> 00:29:00,71
I just think that idea is of mice the ideas that were being experimented with have been adopted by mindstream culture

249
00:29:00,71 --> 00:29:08,41
and. Now that's good. I mean. But i think last has been altered materially we're still a very consumer society.

250
00:29:10,23 --> 00:29:22,19
But that by china. I mean there were a lot of the grain movements now which probably had their origins then.

251
00:29:22,19 --> 00:29:29,48
And it was almost a religion. Became a religion and values of permeating at every level.

252
00:29:32,58 --> 00:29:42,46
I think the federal government and other people in places like the water board and. Planning authorities and.

253
00:29:42,46 --> 00:29:56,19
In government and. Very conscious of those values now. It was unheard of for example. Ten years ago. To actually have.

254
00:29:56,19 --> 00:30:01,8
Citizens recycling with the products of the products of the law who governed level.

255
00:30:01,8 --> 00:30:08,09
And i remember going around of the city council arguing black and blue that i should start a pipe recycling program

256
00:30:08,09 --> 00:30:14,88
and i just said are you mad you know. Just doesn't work it's not economic it's. But i have a top.

257
00:30:16,99 --> 00:30:24,01
It's become absolutely essential that cancer would dare not race so i can win new zealand has got it long before stride

258
00:30:24,01 --> 00:30:30,24
and. When i had some wonderful recycling programs.

259
00:30:30,24 --> 00:30:37,67
But there were things like that that i'm very pleased that they have become my story.

260
00:30:37,67 --> 00:30:47,44
When i was in some why this rampant sort of consumerism is going to my people are now aware.

261
00:30:47,44 --> 00:30:54,96
Much more liable were about the fought resources of the planet and. Available. More careful about what. What i do.

262
00:30:54,96 --> 00:31:01,07
We still hope done a lot of things like transport systems.

263
00:31:01,07 --> 00:31:08,11
But they are there people like bigger cities program that are conscientiously trying to get people out of their cars

264
00:31:08,11 --> 00:31:13,01
they try to work places places to live in places or to integrate them.

265
00:31:13,01 --> 00:31:25,23
There are people pushing a lot rile their paper pushing. Better water systems. Or recycling water stored border.

266
00:31:25,23 --> 00:31:32,09
Plating that they saw from the housing department. Believe it or not is now putting in.

267
00:31:32,09 --> 00:31:35,91
Twin water systems in their houses on the outer suburbs.

268
00:31:35,91 --> 00:31:39,43
Because that i mean they recycle it got two systems of water in there.

269
00:31:39,43 --> 00:31:49,51
If a conscious that they are polluting the whole experience. So i'm very happy about all that.

270
00:31:49,51 --> 00:31:52,98
Maybe not moving fast enough and maybe not being conclusive enough.

271
00:31:53,26 --> 00:31:59,33
My big disappointment is august last fall but i still think that's. Of come to believe that's the issue.

272
00:31:59,33 --> 00:32:06,77
And i can get right through to people in a very at the household level. Which is one reason why.

273
00:32:06,77 --> 00:32:14,13
For example at the moment all interested in a very sort of sewage system that actually starts. The household.

274
00:32:14,13 --> 00:32:17,78
Starts and finishes the house on. Basically people.

275
00:32:17,78 --> 00:32:20,65
More responsible than bureaucracies

276
00:32:20,65 --> 00:32:28,17
and people of very same to me to be very willing to a lab bureaucracies to do the dirty work.

277
00:32:28,17 --> 00:32:35,13
And then criticize him for it but if it was at a household level. About. That's where it really matters.

278
00:32:37,43 --> 00:32:46,87
Just as just as the community had been capable of handling the recycling. Idea. I think i could take on.

279
00:32:46,87 --> 00:32:53,97
Just take it one step further and now start looking at their water supply their stormwater and their sewage.

280
00:32:56,76 --> 00:33:06,16
There's another thing i want to add. Which i perhaps should have said. Some tall guy but that is. After the festival.

281
00:33:06,16 --> 00:33:11,53
Johnny allen and i went to say the department they said well as i said because we thought. You know.

282
00:33:11,53 --> 00:33:18,38
We've got a half and here thousands of people living up there and.

283
00:33:18,38 --> 00:33:24,62
And how we went to see them and said look we think we've got a better formula than you have.

284
00:33:24,62 --> 00:33:33,79
And it's all about lost and interested because i heard you say the phenomena.

285
00:33:33,79 --> 00:33:47,26
But they were at all impressed with the people. I just thought. We're not going to flood the country with lots of the.

286
00:33:47,26 --> 00:33:53,12
The kid's name and i mean one of the best experiences i had there was this. This family have said you know.

287
00:33:53,12 --> 00:34:00,87
My kids came back with that festival and. I thought that was. That was good for that family.

288
00:34:00,87 --> 00:34:07,29
It was really quite a success that in fact the kids had returned because they came back with attitudes that their

289
00:34:07,29 --> 00:34:12,79
parents probably didn't like. But nevertheless i will back that we're going to do.

290
00:34:13,32 --> 00:34:19,17
Tell it all man to get rid of the press to stores in the fertilizer and the whitechapel and. But that was the.

291
00:34:19,17 --> 00:34:25,15
That was the challenge. Back on their own terms not on their own not my parents.

292
00:34:25,15 --> 00:34:38,21
But didn't give us a lot of money to do it again. But it happened anyway. My people started settling in the valley and.

293
00:34:38,21 --> 00:34:44,73
When i was party to setting up a huge problem. We had two hundred shareholders and.

294
00:34:44,73 --> 00:34:55,95
We bought my wonderful place of land on the waterfront and i was still a member of that person that set that was

295
00:34:55,95 --> 00:35:03,83
and sure. Was when i think he actually. When he was committed to the audiology i lost.

296
00:35:03,83 --> 00:35:10,55
But underneath it all he was actually selling insurance policy and people bought it and i said you know.

297
00:35:10,55 --> 00:35:33,12
Here's the life but. If things get crook. North.

298
00:35:33,12 --> 00:35:35,55
Was a lot of i mean i was the lot of the people started

299
00:35:35,55 --> 00:35:46,76
and i was often back to nimbin a couple of times since the festival. Three times four times something.

300
00:35:46,76 --> 00:35:54,93
And proud that i was part of the idea to bring some life into me but i mean. Very proud. I mean i think it.

301
00:35:54,93 --> 00:36:02,22
I think it worked. It went through a lot of. Heaving problems that went through a lot of conflict.

302
00:36:02,22 --> 00:36:11,52
And it was very painful for a lot of people. To confront that sort of lifestyle and to have their lives disrupted.

303
00:36:11,52 --> 00:36:18,56
In that lie but. In the end. I think that the people who settled there.

304
00:36:18,56 --> 00:36:26,9
And the people who lived there with people who went there twenty years ago. Have now become the establishment. When.

305
00:36:26,9 --> 00:36:34,79
The last time was up to the people who are seeking to get out of it we're now the minority and.

306
00:36:34,79 --> 00:36:42,14
I would call the droogs and. Stablished hippies were becoming sort of like the establishment would wish.

307
00:36:42,14 --> 00:36:47,79
That's what resort. But a lot of them have still got their ideals and.

308
00:36:47,79 --> 00:36:52,55
I got involved in what's called a development control plan with some of the rest

309
00:36:52,55 --> 00:37:01,48
and some we did run some workshops about what direction the town wanted to go in and council. Amazingly.

310
00:37:01,48 --> 00:37:11,41
Were prepared to pass. A lot of the responsibility for pairing. Master plans i've a to a community committee.

311
00:37:11,41 --> 00:37:21,12
Of very responsible. Active people and. They did it and. I mean i was just a facilitator from outside it came in and.

312
00:37:21,12 --> 00:37:24,26
And sort of. You know helped it from a technical point of view.

313
00:37:24,26 --> 00:37:36,15
But i was pleased about that and he was citizens getting up and taking control of the town. Instead of continually.

314
00:37:36,15 --> 00:37:42,09
Belong on the council of things. I mean it's that thing of. Acting locally and.

315
00:37:42,09 --> 00:38:11,19
And not not passing responsible down the law and then getting upset about it in my diet i operations.

316
00:38:11,19 --> 00:38:18,65
Very committed to housing and i'm more involved in in community by staffing. And with an aboriginal work.

317
00:38:18,65 --> 00:38:22,05
I've been working for twenty years with the other show has in company.

318
00:38:22,05 --> 00:38:24,55
And i continually run into people in the bureaucracy

319
00:38:24,55 --> 00:38:34,61
or in powerful positions in government who are used to twenty years ago. Place.

320
00:38:34,61 --> 00:38:40,61
But who i knew had been attracted to the side of sort of things i had been attracted to and.

321
00:38:40,61 --> 00:38:46,25
In some ways that i still had constructed spittal. A lot of them still had a lot of. Audiology and.

322
00:38:46,25 --> 00:38:56,8
The best thing about it was that. You could talk. I could talk to them. From a point of view that you would come from.

323
00:38:56,8 --> 00:39:02,55
And one could appeal to some of their. Earlier instincts and.

324
00:39:02,55 --> 00:39:07,14
And sometimes get to a position where we couldn't have got to had we not known each other we had.

325
00:39:07,14 --> 00:39:13,05
I don't know that i'd be there. To put out a bureaucratic facade.

326
00:39:13,05 --> 00:39:19,08
And a lot of people like that with a lot of goodwill and government. In the public service.

327
00:39:19,08 --> 00:39:29,67
Or actually trying to still do things that are important to people and still reflect empowering local people and.

328
00:39:29,67 --> 00:39:38,33
Gendering somebody of corporation. The article read this as maurice piper was still sighing. Communes and calipso.

329
00:39:38,33 --> 00:39:42,29
One of the sort of acts. That might be side.

330
00:39:42,29 --> 00:39:48,27
But then went cooperatively ran in the in the dairy company from the knees and i would birth in about the naughty

331
00:39:48,27 --> 00:39:55,64
and twenties in effect the cult movement got it's going to start in the carry. Dairy industry in the north coast.

332
00:39:55,64 --> 00:39:59,84
And it's not it's not a big shift. To switch to has in cooperatives it's not a hippie.

333
00:39:59,84 --> 00:40:07,67
Thing at all it's like a lot of sense and. I'm particularly committed to has incorporated as is a bridge between.

334
00:40:07,67 --> 00:40:17,05
Rental and. Have an issue and in working with aboriginal communities and exploring and.

335
00:40:17,05 --> 00:40:24,9
Developing community it can commune some community lot of stalls and. Trouble off stalls.

336
00:40:24,9 --> 00:40:27,36
Hundreds of thousands of years probably.

337
00:40:27,36 --> 00:40:34,72
When that's where the co-operative movement and probably got its origins out of trouble cultures.

338
00:40:34,72 --> 00:40:39,02
And it's interesting that the aboriginal communities around. Lismore.

339
00:40:39,02 --> 00:40:46,11
Actually were a vital part of the aquarius festival as well. When i went there in numbers and i participated and.

340
00:40:46,11 --> 00:40:50,12
That was quite a strong part of the festival and.

341
00:40:50,12 --> 00:40:57,69
The hasn't quite removed it is probably in aboriginal circles is one of the strongest movements in the in the state.

342
00:40:57,69 --> 00:41:09,71
Hundreds of passing cops and. Yourself while quentin and i continue to to develop on come up with principles.

343
00:41:19,47 --> 00:41:27,99
Yeah i don't know the landlord she she was canvassed at the at the festival. Issues of commune ality and.

344
00:41:27,99 --> 00:41:39,26
Life style and. Like some of the aboriginal. People would come to that festival. Talked about the students as.

345
00:41:39,26 --> 00:41:40,14
Whatever originals.

346
00:41:40,14 --> 00:41:49,93
Like that their perception was that a lot of guilty of culture was infecting experimenting with an aboriginal lifestyle.

347
00:41:49,93 --> 00:41:57,77
Like having little impact on the land. Eating more natural materials and.

348
00:41:57,77 --> 00:42:03,03
Acting and into tying themselves in a very aboriginal sort of wide like dancing and singing

349
00:42:03,03 --> 00:42:11,99
and campfire sort of culture was. Was very evident and.

350
00:42:11,99 --> 00:42:25,46
People like harry penrose and lots of people who are aboriginal people. Well connected in the bundjalung. Mob.

351
00:42:27,24 --> 00:42:38,62
Gary williams had gotten involved and. Who had a powerful influence i think and a lot of the thinking. But a burden.

352
00:42:38,62 --> 00:42:40,59
That's how it was used to call her parents but.

353
00:42:40,59 --> 00:42:46,13
I mean he was and has been continuously involved in an alternative lifestyle sort of movement.

354
00:42:46,13 --> 00:42:56,12
And in trying to connect what. Strides with a sort of a tribal culture.
