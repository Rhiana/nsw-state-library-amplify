1
00:00:12,9 --> 00:00:26,39
Yes. Well it was. What we tried to do was keep a change of the drug laws. On the agenda. And.

2
00:00:26,39 --> 00:00:30,82
Try and confront society with that. My stand popular fact that it was the.

3
00:00:31,92 --> 00:00:43,99
The prohibition of these substances which were creating a great deal of the problems that we had in this society.

4
00:00:43,99 --> 00:00:57,07
It was a pretty frustrating task. I became aware of the degree of paranoia that exists in the tan. In this area.

5
00:00:57,76 --> 00:01:07,05
Most hassles would have one member. Has been. Wife love a son or daughter.

6
00:01:07,05 --> 00:01:21,53
Friend cousin relative who probably use pot in some degree. And with the attention that had been focused on named and.

7
00:01:21,53 --> 00:01:32,41
Big rides helicopter rides. Destroy type missions. That were regular part of life here. People be.

8
00:01:32,41 --> 00:01:39,74
Became extremely afraid to express their opinion.

9
00:01:39,74 --> 00:01:47,06
And that was probably the most significant thing that i found was the impact that the drug lords were having on society

10
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:57,06
in that way. People were more prepared to be. Acquiescent. About the laws.

11
00:01:57,06 --> 00:02:05,03
Rather than to challenge them in the hope that they wouldn't stand up in the background scenery.

12
00:02:05,03 --> 00:02:12,3
And that really hasn't changed a great deal. Although there are more and more people.

13
00:02:12,66 --> 00:02:31,74
These days prepared to make a statement publicly about the drug lords. Not really elected. Well i.

14
00:02:31,74 --> 00:02:38,66
In ninety ninety one i stood as an independent candidate on a drug reform ticket in the state parliament.

15
00:02:38,99 --> 00:02:51,04
There's a campaign that i ran pretty much by myself. And it was an opportunity to playa belair in politics. Given that.

16
00:02:51,04 --> 00:03:01,93
It was just really a one person campaign a two and a half thousand votes that i got it wasn't too bad at all.

17
00:03:01,93 --> 00:03:14,61
And i did indicate. To some extent the feeling that was he of the people i voted i ran on a campaign of.

18
00:03:14,61 --> 00:03:20,78
Viking is anonymous. He was a chance to put down your opinion.

19
00:03:20,78 --> 00:03:34,24
And for one one his single issue campaign and it works well. But the problem about the problem that i say that.

20
00:03:34,24 --> 00:03:41,51
Came as a consequence of. My actions is that it has tended to make the the anti drug lobby.

21
00:03:41,51 --> 00:03:56,61
Less likely to stand up and do things. Whilst at the same time. The negative consequences. Of prohibition. Continue.

22
00:03:56,61 --> 00:03:59,18
And so they are largely on checked.

23
00:03:59,18 --> 00:04:07,87
This to me is the challenge of the alternative society of the name and society is somehow rather. Setting to apply.

24
00:04:07,87 --> 00:04:16,66
The fact is in society. That work to. Sorting out these problems. In such a why.

25
00:04:16,66 --> 00:04:20,29
As the community itself and the people within the community.

26
00:04:20,29 --> 00:04:25,76
I mean pallid that they are i built to realize that they can affect shines.

27
00:04:25,76 --> 00:04:30,95
The marijuana laws seem a bit like the work week chink in the.

28
00:04:30,95 --> 00:04:42,01
Because they saw the light and laid problematic lor's there they are laws that don't hold up to scrutiny in any why.

29
00:04:42,01 --> 00:04:53,02
It seemed like. This was a why that. The whole of society. Could be challenged. But.

30
00:04:53,02 --> 00:05:18,03
Difficult really is difficult go and i ran yeah i was part of that campaign. Nimbin. Did. Create it.

31
00:05:18,03 --> 00:05:25,71
The options are available here in him and. Allowed me to campaign in. Pretty many creative why.

32
00:05:25,71 --> 00:05:39,45
One of the wise was the. Advertising on television a local media organization offered to do. Ads for me. Program them.

33
00:05:39,45 --> 00:05:47,63
Or range for them to be programmed in. And that was a bit of a first for. Well it was a first for them.

34
00:05:47,63 --> 00:05:57,35
And it was a first for a local television. Op in this area. You know much else i can cite at it really.

35
00:06:06,06 --> 00:06:12,3
No i don't know that there's been marijuana campaign or marijuana.

36
00:06:12,45 --> 00:06:25,05
The campaign as you know their electorates another election on. But this was the first time that. There's been a local.

37
00:06:25,05 --> 00:06:28,48
Marijuana party. Top campaign run up here.

38
00:06:28,48 --> 00:06:36,82
The elections were great because i did offered that opportunity for a focus on an issue.

39
00:06:36,82 --> 00:06:44,95
I ran a very much a sort of barefoot politician campaign running without a great deal of funds

40
00:06:44,95 --> 00:06:52,29
and we had a great deal of. Visible. Upfront support. You know terms of people.

41
00:06:52,29 --> 00:07:00,68
You know i had nobody stuffing polling booths was very difficult to get people to make any sort of commitment.

42
00:07:00,68 --> 00:07:23,64
In which they publicly committed themselves for drug reform. Or drug law reform.

43
00:07:23,64 --> 00:07:36,26
The degree of paranoia that was he surprised me. Didn't shake my faith in the in the night or the name in community.

44
00:07:36,26 --> 00:07:46,38
It made me aware of just the pressures that people around and made me say. Just how much of a backbone marijuana.

45
00:07:46,38 --> 00:07:55,27
Is to the economy here. And and made me realize that any chinese that i did try and institute.

46
00:07:55,27 --> 00:07:57,88
Eufaula as i will to be successful in bringing a bed to china

47
00:07:57,88 --> 00:08:00,81
and you would have severely affected the laws of a lot of people saw it.

48
00:08:00,81 --> 00:08:13,74
Of being caught on that sort of dilemma between keeping people here. In a sustainable. Income.

49
00:08:13,74 --> 00:08:24,93
And yet at the same time trying to eliminate those negative aspects of it. If marijuana was sold on a cook.

50
00:08:24,93 --> 00:08:33,49
Through a growing cooperative basis. Marketed by a local organization the did pay taxes back into the community.

51
00:08:33,49 --> 00:08:38,36
Not back into the states and federal communities but back into the libel community.

52
00:08:38,69 --> 00:08:48,38
Then we'd have a lot of the a lot of the negative effects of the marijuana tried would be diminished a lot of the

53
00:08:48,38 --> 00:08:54,21
imperatives that are there in the marijuana try the need for people to. Then an encounter.

54
00:08:54,21 --> 00:09:08,61
To try and paint it to their consumption does are as. The degree of hypocrisy that was in society.

55
00:09:08,61 --> 00:09:13,97
Kids would find it very difficult here because they were saying their parents smoking pot.

56
00:09:13,97 --> 00:09:23,98
Selling pot in a lot of cases. And yet. Having to. Publicly present a different persona.

57
00:09:28,3 --> 00:09:32,13
And at the same time telling their kids to keep away from drugs.

58
00:09:32,98 --> 00:09:43,13
It only really served to make the situation worse the kids were getting into drugs. And marijuana. But also alcohol.

59
00:09:43,13 --> 00:09:51,02
And every now and again some of the local kids would resort to using chemical substances. But in a lot of cases.

60
00:09:52,55 --> 00:10:04,05
My experience shows me that those people who are more inclined towards getting into things like heroin was who really

61
00:10:04,05 --> 00:10:12,3
feel a lot of pain in society whether that's from broken homes drum. Brutal pay.

62
00:10:13,96 --> 00:10:28,5
From being in allow a socio economic situations. I don't believe that the. That the fact that marijuana is illegal.

63
00:10:28,5 --> 00:10:31,74
And that people use it. Lead people on to hero and use.

64
00:10:33,01 --> 00:10:42,71
I believe that people get into hero and used to try and only unite the pine. That they feel in their laws.

65
00:10:42,71 --> 00:10:52,63
And just like the sly drug dealers. And the brothels. Went to the gulch fields. In the fifty's in ballarat.

66
00:10:52,63 --> 00:11:03,62
In the gulf field of the gulf eels in australia. And pride on the miners. To do the. Heroin dealers.

67
00:11:03,62 --> 00:11:12,91
Come to name them and use the local flight large flutings a man of.

68
00:11:12,91 --> 00:11:34,29
Of money that's there as a source of guying to them in return for heroin. With my own kids smoking pot.

69
00:11:34,29 --> 00:11:47,11
Was one of those things that i tried not to encourage. And it came as a bit of i. Shock the first time that i fand.

70
00:11:47,11 --> 00:12:03,28
My oldest daughter was smoking. And it made me realise just what my own. Real aspirations were and my and.

71
00:12:03,28 --> 00:12:13,97
Free wheeling attitude. Or just what my freewheeling attitude was really worth. In relation to. Drugs.

72
00:12:13,97 --> 00:12:22,09
Have subsequently modified this approach. Adam my children. Three out of the four smoke.

73
00:12:23,86 --> 00:12:36,38
And basically they cope with it reasonably well and. I myself wouldn't. Promote the use of marijuana by anybody.

74
00:12:36,38 --> 00:12:52,61
Or for anybody. But at the same time i can't put down people who do smoke. So i've had to take.

75
00:12:52,61 --> 00:13:05,87
For myself part of the responsibility for setting this particular example. I've also tried to educate them.

76
00:13:05,87 --> 00:13:15,06
Into what i consider to be an advocate of smoking. You don't rip off your friends. Well you don't rip off anybody.

77
00:13:15,06 --> 00:13:20,81
If you're going to provide. Marijuana it's possible that everyone can provide it and so.

78
00:13:21,62 --> 00:13:37,51
So encourage them to grow their own. To look upon it. In that sacramental why that marijuana really is. For instance.

79
00:13:40,15 --> 00:13:49,36
In traditional societies. Substances that change consciousness have always had a place but the places.

80
00:13:49,36 --> 00:14:02,02
Being well defined within society. They generally have a particular outcome they guarded. The people who god.

81
00:14:02,02 --> 00:14:13,66
Are experienced. Over a long period of learning in how to deal with the effects of the consciousness check. Changing.

82
00:14:13,66 --> 00:14:24,54
Substance. What we've done in our society is we've dropped right away from the adage. There's no.

83
00:14:24,54 --> 00:14:37,81
Cultural controls at all on how the. Consciousness changing drugs are used in society. So they used randomly.

84
00:14:37,81 --> 00:14:40,4
They use walls only.

85
00:14:40,4 --> 00:14:53,93
They used you know why that is more to a particular immediate gratification rather than seen in the context of a growth

86
00:14:53,93 --> 00:15:11,00
and as a means of. But handling society and investigating deeper truths that exist within society.

87
00:15:11,00 --> 00:15:24,64
A lot of people do come to niman with. Probably a slightly incorrect view of what newman is going to be like.

88
00:15:24,64 --> 00:15:31,82
Because the mainstream society generally doesn't allow for a great deal of. You know personal communication.

89
00:15:31,82 --> 00:15:40,35
Randomly amongst people. People come here looking for thanks and. Community interaction.

90
00:15:40,35 --> 00:15:50,06
A sense of being important in themselves. And a lot of them don't find it here.

91
00:15:50,06 --> 00:15:58,7
Ultimately it's all within themselves it's all within ourselves this capability to create a new society.

92
00:15:58,7 --> 00:16:07,99
Along the the y. That we want to advance and much by. What's being fed into us by society in the past.

93
00:16:07,99 --> 00:16:17,02
That we are limited in what we are able to actually achieve. A lot of the communities around here.

94
00:16:17,02 --> 00:16:23,06
If you view it dispassionately you'll find that the.

95
00:16:23,06 --> 00:16:32,48
Just has and states where people don't necessarily have a great deal of contact with their neighbors with a community.

96
00:16:32,48 --> 00:16:37,88
They buy a share in a lot of cases that's just a predetermine a lot and.

97
00:16:37,88 --> 00:16:45,81
They build their houses they build a gallons you know why that's quite similar to the suburban dream.

98
00:16:45,81 --> 00:16:55,21
That has grabbed them. Even though that i realize that when they come here they still vann by this suburban dream.

99
00:16:55,21 --> 00:17:00,09
But i really like what timothy leary. Said about the decline of the flower children.

100
00:17:00,09 --> 00:17:04,9
The flower children may be gone but. They've spread this.

101
00:17:04,9 --> 00:17:10,83
And that's when the seeds take root that we'll see the real flaring of the new society.

102
00:17:11,06 --> 00:17:17,35
I tend to think that that that's happening more and more i see a china. That's coming about.

103
00:17:17,35 --> 00:17:25,17
You know a lot of the young people particularly the young people here in name and. As they grow.

104
00:17:25,17 --> 00:17:37,69
And it almost parallels the growth of the name and. Alternative society itself. The twenty years. I'll always.

105
00:17:37,69 --> 00:17:43,98
Is a society barely out of adolescence. There's a lot of ground to do.

106
00:17:45,54 --> 00:17:56,63
There's a lot of maturing a lot of wisdom to to get a lot of implementing of what we've learned to nasa saudi.

107
00:17:56,63 --> 00:17:57,35
It's happening.

108
00:17:57,35 --> 00:18:03,06
It's happening all the time that five years ago there wasn't environments

109
00:18:03,06 --> 00:18:12,3
and there hasn't been a lot of the organizations run by pat company hadn't congealed into an actual working group and.

110
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:18,84
A lot of the. Health networks the support networks that exist here.

111
00:18:19,06 --> 00:18:26,77
The holes that have been built on the communities the community consultation processes that have come more

112
00:18:26,77 --> 00:18:36,53
and more into play. To me are evidence. All of the alternative society. Actually getting its act together.

113
00:18:36,53 --> 00:18:45,27
Bringing the lessons from what they've learned. On the home communities. Into the public life of name and. And women.

114
00:18:45,27 --> 00:18:52,85
Is benefiting. Substantially from the experiences of these new settlers. But like everywhere.

115
00:18:52,85 --> 00:18:55,59
Once a society starts to flourish.

116
00:18:55,59 --> 00:19:07,39
You do also get an attraction by a lot of people who see an active social cultural life going down.

117
00:19:07,39 --> 00:19:15,5
Visible in the streets. A lifestyle that. Can attract them as. Holding the k.

118
00:19:15,5 --> 00:19:26,21
To their own personal in a to them but the reality. Still is very much of an emerging society.

119
00:19:26,21 --> 00:19:36,02
It's frustrating for a lot of people who do come here. With a lot of ney's or. With a lot of emotional needs.

120
00:19:36,02 --> 00:19:48,63
Mental disturbance. Well look it's frustrating for a lot of people who come here with or seeking an emotional.

121
00:19:48,63 --> 00:19:58,81
Answer to the things that are provided within the dominant society.

122
00:19:58,81 --> 00:20:02,55
And they come here and find that people are still basically the same people.

123
00:20:03,13 --> 00:20:03,38
It's like

124
00:20:03,38 --> 00:20:09,65
when you made somebody famous by sickly they're still the same person that probably got a bit of breakfast dangling on

125
00:20:09,65 --> 00:20:16,07
the front of the issue. The human i mean this is. One of the lessons that is really good to learn here that.

126
00:20:17,93 --> 00:20:24,73
That if you want. This ideal society. You have to sort of dredge it out from within yourself. Find it.

127
00:20:24,73 --> 00:20:31,54
Find that sense of strength and courage that. That is there. And just go for.

128
00:20:31,54 --> 00:20:39,36
We've got everything to lose at the moment. Society is just hanging on the edge. And nieman to may.

129
00:20:39,36 --> 00:20:47,95
Has that capability to create some state of hills. If you have the whole society. Affected by disease.

130
00:20:48,43 --> 00:20:52,58
Then it means the disease. Is able to grow and spread.

131
00:20:52,58 --> 00:20:59,72
In order to can direct that you have to create some sort of pocket of health. That will grow and spread.

132
00:20:59,72 --> 00:21:08,59
Affect the areas around it. Because an immense connotations. All of. An alternative. Visionary prophetic society.

133
00:21:08,79 --> 00:21:19,91
It seems to me that we've got the groundwork set in place here. To create some element of society ill health.

134
00:21:19,91 --> 00:21:30,14
And from that. If we can just hang on long enough. Then the chinese will happen will be able to spread. What.

135
00:21:30,14 --> 00:21:39,09
We've learnt. Altena to the rest of society. You know.

136
00:21:43,98 --> 00:21:59,31
When you look at what i currently in the know what do i hope that. What i when i look at the kids around this area.

137
00:22:00,02 --> 00:22:12,3
What on likely to say. Is what i'm likely to see when i look at the kids in this area.

138
00:22:12,63 --> 00:22:22,53
Are the lessons already learnt that. Way their parents took a great deal of time to learn. Sometimes in about thirty s.

139
00:22:22,53 --> 00:22:33,63
Forty's fifty's. We've still going through the pine. Of experiencing. Things that are being kept from us.

140
00:22:33,63 --> 00:22:36,79
With kids to die. In him and.

141
00:22:36,79 --> 00:22:43,07
They tend to be much more mature experienced in a lot of the things that were never talked about.

142
00:22:43,07 --> 00:22:51,49
As part of their generation. I seem to be able to cope with. China a lot better.

143
00:22:51,49 --> 00:23:12,02
I seem to be more likely to be communal to be. Supporting of each other they tend to go through a in a lot of cases.

144
00:23:12,02 --> 00:23:20,03
Despair frustration. Just like most other kids. But for the ones who are growing up here.

145
00:23:20,39 --> 00:23:27,52
I'm really impressed with the why that they actually do. Seem to find a path. At some point.

146
00:23:27,52 --> 00:23:35,31
Which becomes really solid. Because it's young it has that energy. That's able to achieve things.

147
00:23:35,31 --> 00:23:47,89
I got a great deal of hope in the future. When i look at. The kids that i've grown up with here.
