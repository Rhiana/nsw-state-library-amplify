1
00:00:13,42 --> 00:00:37,26
I think. That's right. That's right. Ok. My name's eddie boots. I'm an architect and.

2
00:00:37,26 --> 00:00:47,49
An environmental activist i suppose you could call me. I've been living in the syria for eighteen years. In fact.

3
00:00:47,49 --> 00:00:57,88
I arrived here. The year after the queries festival. We were in fact. Overseas during the. Aquarius festival.

4
00:00:59,14 --> 00:01:07,23
Traveling through southeast asia and other places on to europe and then back again. And when we arrived back from.

5
00:01:08,38 --> 00:01:14,64
From our trip. All our friends were telling us about the aquarius festival.

6
00:01:15,71 --> 00:01:25,82
And prior to our overseas trip we already decided to. Get out of sydney. We were living in sydney i had a practice.

7
00:01:25,82 --> 00:01:29,71
To take short practice in sydney and.

8
00:01:29,71 --> 00:01:38,88
I wasn't very satisfied with my practice or my lifestyle and we wanted to move into the country.

9
00:01:39,7 --> 00:01:53,19
We felt that we could do some things that we weren't able to do in the city. Basically live a more laid back lifestyle.

10
00:01:53,19 --> 00:01:57,78
Unpolluted that. Miss phoebe. We were living in belle maine.

11
00:01:57,78 --> 00:02:03,78
And we had the colgate palmolive factory right next to us we used to belch.

12
00:02:03,78 --> 00:02:11,95
Huge billowing clouds of black smoke out every night. Not during the day only at night and. We we saw.

13
00:02:11,96 --> 00:02:20,09
I felt we were suffocating a bit. Even though it was a pleasant place to live in the rain in lots of other respects.

14
00:02:20,09 --> 00:02:27,38
So we'd already made up our minds that we were going to leave the city and. Set up somewhere in the country.

15
00:02:27,38 --> 00:02:32,25
But we had no idea where we were going to in fact travel around australia looking for a place.

16
00:02:33,13 --> 00:02:38,3
So anyway when we came back from from our overseas trip.

17
00:02:38,3 --> 00:02:47,16
As i said before our friends were talking about their queries festival. And name been. So we thought well.

18
00:02:47,16 --> 00:02:51,83
We'll check out. Nimbin first before we do the rest of the straight.

19
00:02:52,53 --> 00:03:02,55
And so we came out while still living in sydney we. We made an excursion. Up here and.

20
00:03:02,55 --> 00:03:11,28
Sort of fell in love with the place immediately and. Found quite a lot of people. Post the queer us.

21
00:03:11,28 --> 00:03:21,11
People who decided to stay on the tundra bull. And various other places and. So there.

22
00:03:21,11 --> 00:03:30,53
We made the decision there in that this was where we'd come to and. We found a house and land.

23
00:03:31,64 --> 00:03:37,64
We found that the house in bel maine which we still owed money on but.

24
00:03:37,64 --> 00:03:45,73
We found that we could sell that one for the proceeds we could buy this piece of land here in linden and.

25
00:03:49,35 --> 00:03:55,39
And we'd have a bit of change left over to guide us through and hopefully we got some income.

26
00:03:57,5 --> 00:04:06,26
So that's how we came to be here in nine hundred seventy four the year of the big. Lismore flood.

27
00:04:07,59 --> 00:04:17,63
All our belongings arrived in lismore and went into hensley's storage. Which was perched. Above the river.

28
00:04:17,63 --> 00:04:24,13
And the floods came and the river rose and rose and rose and we thought our stuff was going to float away.

29
00:04:24,42 --> 00:04:31,13
It came to within inch within an inch of. Of our belongings. And then. Thankfully. Receded.

30
00:04:32,17 --> 00:04:41,00
So that was our introduction to nimbin wait. Those the first years were very weight. The piece of land.

31
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:53,35
And the house that we'd bought. Already had occupancy in it. People who had been raining or squatting camping.

32
00:04:53,35 --> 00:05:06,58
But we all fitted in very nicely together. We leave. We. We lived in. Shared the house basically. And.

33
00:05:06,58 --> 00:05:15,95
Started life in the country. We were totally inexperienced. We were charged up with a lot of idealism and.

34
00:05:15,95 --> 00:05:26,5
We had lots of ideas about what we wanted to see happen. But we had very little the reality of living in the country.

35
00:05:27,43 --> 00:05:39,28
So the first few years were really. Discovering what it was all about. Starting up gardens and orchards.

36
00:05:39,28 --> 00:05:49,53
Rebuilding the house which was. Daily livable. It was a sort of. Rundown. Country. Cottage. But not.

37
00:05:49,53 --> 00:05:57,71
Not one of your classical veranda. Places but a jerry built sort of joint. And so we.

38
00:05:57,71 --> 00:06:04,92
We started rebuilding the house and then we got involved with.

39
00:06:04,92 --> 00:06:12,98
The what was quickly growing community of new settlers from all over the. Country.

40
00:06:14,34 --> 00:06:20,39
There were first of all there were people that were left over from the aquarius first of all the ones who didn't even

41
00:06:20,39 --> 00:06:25,71
bother leaving. Or those who went. Went away and. Reorganize themselves.

42
00:06:25,71 --> 00:06:35,44
Their affairs and then came back to leave here and from then on there was a stream of people coming to the area and.

43
00:06:35,44 --> 00:06:44,91
Most of us. Faced similar difficulties housing and and. And schooling. And so probably one of the first.

44
00:06:44,91 --> 00:06:58,2
Community things we were involved in was setting up the community school. Which incidentally still operating. So that.

45
00:06:58,2 --> 00:07:09,47
You know at least. The education part was going to be taken care of daughter. Was tane up the.

46
00:07:09,47 --> 00:07:20,07
Tane at the time i think and. And there were lots of other people who were in a similar situation. Mainly.

47
00:07:22,31 --> 00:07:29,07
Professionals or. Students or. You know young graduates.

48
00:07:29,07 --> 00:07:37,04
A very highly qualified lot actually refute g.'s from the cities mainly sydney and melbourne.

49
00:07:37,04 --> 00:07:50,64
But other capital cities as well. And so. My first involvement was the school. Pretty soon along the way. My next.

50
00:07:50,64 --> 00:07:58,51
Sort of main interest became. What became known as the home builders association.

51
00:07:59,85 --> 00:08:06,7
Under the circumstances that we were facing here a lot of people moved on to vacant blocks of land.

52
00:08:07,93 --> 00:08:25,04
I think that someone. Right. So yeah there were years and people fought. Right in. So in the seventy's.

53
00:08:25,69 --> 00:08:36,06
In the early seventy's as people were rising he finding that. Often they were moving on to. They can pieces of land.

54
00:08:36,06 --> 00:08:44,26
Buying land and. Buying into communities and there was no housing for them. So they pictured tain and.

55
00:08:44,26 --> 00:08:53,22
And very rudimentary shelters and. Try and cope with the weather. The leeches and the ticks and.

56
00:08:53,22 --> 00:09:00,17
And all the rest of it and so shelter became a very important first step. Getting them.

57
00:09:00,17 --> 00:09:10,4
Getting set up so that you were out of the weather. And so. People generally came with very little capital.

58
00:09:13,14 --> 00:09:19,5
They couldn't afford to get someone to build them a house. That was almost totally out of the question.

59
00:09:21,04 --> 00:09:33,08
So what people did was they became. Own the builders. They bought. And scavenged materials. Bought second hand stuff.

60
00:09:33,08 --> 00:09:46,74
And scavenge that. Wherever they could find it and used. Poles and. You know which they'd cut. They'd cut trees.

61
00:09:46,74 --> 00:09:56,77
On their properties. And they used these materials to put up their houses. Now.

62
00:09:57,1 --> 00:10:05,81
And they were very innovative and very interesting houses. However the council didn't find them.

63
00:10:05,81 --> 00:10:22,36
Innovative or interesting. They found the total affront to their regulations. And so. While they turned a blind eye.

64
00:10:22,36 --> 00:10:33,64
Because they didn't really know how to cope with it. But then there was a police raid on a on a property.

65
00:10:35,63 --> 00:10:43,31
The rainy away. Rainy a valley. Wallace road. Actually and. It was to do with marijuana.

66
00:10:43,88 --> 00:10:52,00
And i can't remember whether there were drugs on the place or not but. As a result of it. The police.

67
00:10:52,00 --> 00:11:00,3
Made a complaint to the council. Saying that this property had more buildings on it than were permitted.

68
00:11:00,3 --> 00:11:06,82
And because of the police complaint the council was obliged to send their inspectors out.

69
00:11:06,82 --> 00:11:16,85
Which they did and the inspectors. Inspected the buildings and was. They found that there were three.

70
00:11:16,85 --> 00:11:19,22
Three more buildings. On the site.

71
00:11:19,22 --> 00:11:25,32
Them were allowed in that the buildings didn't comply with regulations in various ways. You know.

72
00:11:25,32 --> 00:11:31,28
Maybe the ceiling height wasn't quite right. Or they might have had a loft in them which.

73
00:11:31,28 --> 00:11:45,6
In those days the lofts were recognized. And so. They are the owners of the property to demolish.

74
00:11:45,6 --> 00:11:55,14
The excess houses and fix up what was left to meet regulations. These people were prepared to do that.

75
00:11:55,14 --> 00:12:05,48
They put a lot of love and if it. Into building the shelters and. Had no intention of. Demolishing any of them.

76
00:12:08,02 --> 00:12:11,95
And eventually things came to a head they had a number of warnings and then the.

77
00:12:12,15 --> 00:12:17,68
Next thing was the council issued them with a demolition order which said. If you don't.

78
00:12:17,68 --> 00:12:26,21
Demolish we're going to come out and do it for you. Well they. They got in touch with friends and.

79
00:12:26,21 --> 00:12:31,39
Pretty soon the network of. New settlers in the area.

80
00:12:31,39 --> 00:12:36,8
Alerted to what was about to happen and most of us were in very similar circumstances.

81
00:12:37,02 --> 00:12:45,87
So we had a meeting in the in the media center. Which is where we are and a hundred people turned up.

82
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:54,13
And we formed the home builders association which was. Initially it was formed to.

83
00:12:56,41 --> 00:13:06,79
To stop council from going ahead with the demolition. And then grew to be an organization that generally fos the and.

84
00:13:06,79 --> 00:13:16,47
Assisted the process of home building. In the area. Did a lot of communal projects we organize work gangs.

85
00:13:16,47 --> 00:13:24,71
Work days on various properties. Put up places and. Had facilities and so on.

86
00:13:24,71 --> 00:13:38,43
And we are open negotiations with that with the council and. A group of us.

87
00:13:38,43 --> 00:13:45,12
Carry these negotiations on with council for quite a number of years. You know buildings were ever demolished.

88
00:13:46,52 --> 00:13:58,38
And gradually we. We convinced council with the systems of the state government. Excuse me.

89
00:13:58,38 --> 00:14:07,95
Who are very sympathetic to our cause and i'll come to that in a minute. With assistance of the state government we.

90
00:14:07,95 --> 00:14:21,08
We have we got implemented. Multiple occupancy. Planning regulations which. Recognized more than.

91
00:14:21,08 --> 00:14:32,27
The perscribe number of buildings. Per acreage that. That was in the in the in the regulations at that time.

92
00:14:32,27 --> 00:14:36,86
Recognize the need. Allowed more buildings and.

93
00:14:37,78 --> 00:14:48,92
And we also started to get council loosened up on some of their interpretations of. Building by laws.

94
00:14:48,92 --> 00:14:59,41
As real as regards materials things like mud brick and recycled material. Pole frames and stuff like that and also we.

95
00:14:59,41 --> 00:15:08,86
We got them to recognize. Aloft by. We were allowed to build lofts because we had.

96
00:15:08,86 --> 00:15:18,47
But we had to call them storage spaces. But then we'd sleep in them. And i think. Named and sort of.

97
00:15:18,47 --> 00:15:24,89
Pioneered the loft. We. You know there's so many houses with lofts in them because they are very handy.

98
00:15:24,89 --> 00:15:35,01
Way of utilizing space. I mean we had to confront them on a whole range of building issues you know for instance.

99
00:15:35,01 --> 00:15:39,96
There was one house that. Didn't have a wall.

100
00:15:39,96 --> 00:15:48,7
As far as the council's concerned you cannot have a house with or without a war. You must have a wall.

101
00:15:48,7 --> 00:16:01,5
So when when is a wall a wall and when is a blank space or a or a tree or a or a vase. When does that become a wall.

102
00:16:01,5 --> 00:16:08,96
Enclosed space so we had these ridiculous arguments with them about matters of the.

103
00:16:12,41 --> 00:16:26,54
During all this time we had terrific input from. People in sydney university. And. They helped us.

104
00:16:26,54 --> 00:16:32,31
With the whole process of getting multiple occupancy happening and the loosening up of the regulations

105
00:16:32,31 --> 00:16:45,32
and recognition of other building. Forms of you know the ones the council was used to. Let's see. I've got it.

106
00:16:45,32 --> 00:16:54,21
I've got to draw my breath. Going son. We had a lot of help from the state government.

107
00:16:54,21 --> 00:17:05,03
And at that time it was never all rain. And the labor government. And there. And there was a particularly sympathetic.

108
00:17:05,03 --> 00:17:18,04
Minister for planning. Paul enda. Unfortunately died a few years ago. A young man. And he was.

109
00:17:18,04 --> 00:17:29,75
He was quite enthusiastic about what we were doing and. Very supportive. So he helped change the state. Planning laws.

110
00:17:31,99 --> 00:17:45,59
Polenta was also involved in another matter of great interest to us at the time. And. And this is. This is my other.

111
00:17:45,59 --> 00:17:56,64
One of my other great passions if you can call it that. Which relates to the environment. Now.

112
00:17:56,64 --> 00:18:11,25
In in the early in the mid seventy's. A group of new settlers in their ania. Became aware that the forest.

113
00:18:11,25 --> 00:18:19,33
At the end of the. The virgin rain forest that they're in their valley. Was about to be logged.

114
00:18:20,59 --> 00:18:29,36
And they began to organize resistance to it. Generally trying to persuade the forestry commission of the following.

115
00:18:29,36 --> 00:18:39,31
Folly of. That course of action. They weren't successful the forestry commission is pretty intractable now.

116
00:18:39,31 --> 00:18:50,07
In those days. They were totally a law unto themselves and. And weren't. Into any public input whatsoever.

117
00:18:51,3 --> 00:18:59,33
They were unsuccessful the campaign. Went on for a number of years until in one thousand nine hundred seventy nine.

118
00:18:59,33 --> 00:19:14,77
The bulldozers started moving in. Again. This network of people was alerted and. Hundreds of us from around the valley.

119
00:19:14,77 --> 00:19:23,9
Nearby to raney and the people in terrain itself. Went to the forest and blockaded the bulldozers.

120
00:19:26,83 --> 00:19:37,51
I think most people have probably heard about rain here. It was probably the first major environmental direct action.

121
00:19:37,69 --> 00:19:53,17
You know strayer. And it set the pace and the start of many future. Environmental actions. For me it was a real.

122
00:19:55,1 --> 00:20:03,83
I opened because i'd been aware of rain forests. When i moved up here i became aware of rain forests there were.

123
00:20:03,83 --> 00:20:15,47
You know around us and it sort of had a look here and there. But i didn't really know. What they were about.

124
00:20:15,47 --> 00:20:28,82
And the terrain your protest really. Crystallize the environmental concerns. Because he was.

125
00:20:28,82 --> 00:20:38,71
He was a rain forest which. I discovered was one of the most copper complex. Ecosystems on the planet.

126
00:20:40,33 --> 00:20:45,87
With an amazing diverse the of flora and fauna.

127
00:20:45,87 --> 00:20:53,32
We lived in the forest during this protest we were there all the time we were in and we were up and down trees

128
00:20:53,32 --> 00:21:01,49
and we were in front of the bulldozers and we were running off into the forest. Playing. Chasings with the police.

129
00:21:02,41 --> 00:21:11,95
And this went on for a number of weeks. So there was there was this mass conversion of people.

130
00:21:11,95 --> 00:21:24,88
To the defense of the rain forest. People just really got turned on to what. Rain forest was about. And and for me.

131
00:21:24,88 --> 00:21:38,64
It led to an involvement in rain forest protection from that time onwards. And pole end it was.

132
00:21:38,64 --> 00:21:48,1
I started this off by saying paul and was involved well. Paul ndaa. Again. Gave support to the.

133
00:21:48,1 --> 00:22:04,00
To our pleas for protecting the forest and. Well this is history now. The logging. Was stopped. An inquiry was set up.

134
00:22:05,56 --> 00:22:11,95
Which dragged on for a year and spent a million dollars and it was never really used. The result.

135
00:22:12,43 --> 00:22:23,37
We're never really used by that time other events. Caught up with with the rainy and.

136
00:22:23,37 --> 00:22:37,35
Fairly soon after all those areas became part of what eventually became world heritage area is in nineteen eighty two.

137
00:22:37,35 --> 00:23:04,85
There was a similar similar. Forest protest. Here in the night cap range. Well i think it did.

138
00:23:04,85 --> 00:23:19,35
I think it did then not well. Named been named in. You could say became the front line of environmental defense.

139
00:23:19,35 --> 00:23:31,68
Out of the protests. Came other similar protests. The night cap. Range. Middle head. Beach. This was.

140
00:23:31,68 --> 00:23:42,57
This was in the rain forest forest matter this was saying mining of the beach. On the on the north coast.

141
00:23:42,57 --> 00:23:45,17
But it was again it was driven by.

142
00:23:45,17 --> 00:24:00,00
The protest was driven by a concern that he was a pristine environment being destroyed for. Short profit. And i mean.

143
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:08,71
I mean there were also. They were extracting minerals which were going into. Atomic warheads and so on so the.

144
00:24:08,71 --> 00:24:15,77
Were all these other aspects involved and. We were very. Much against that that that. Campaign incidentally was lost.

145
00:24:15,77 --> 00:24:35,01
The beach. The beach was mined the forest. The forest and they were destroyed. Also in nineteen eighty two.

146
00:24:35,01 --> 00:24:50,92
While the nightcap. Protest was happening. Tasmania in tasmania. The. The. Franklin was under threat.

147
00:24:50,92 --> 00:24:54,92
And the tasmanian environmentalists was starting to get organized.

148
00:24:54,92 --> 00:25:01,98
To see what they could do and they were very interested in what we were doing here. In those same grippers in.

149
00:25:01,98 --> 00:25:15,95
To talk to us and see what we were doing. And we kept in constant touch. Until. Until in must be in late.

150
00:25:15,95 --> 00:25:32,25
Nineteen eighty two. Work started on the franklin. And the blockade of the franklin began. And many people from me.

151
00:25:32,25 --> 00:25:44,49
Well perhaps. Like myself. They packed their kids' few belongings into kombi van zyl and. Other vehicles.

152
00:25:44,49 --> 00:25:57,63
And made the trek down to tassie. And then in spain. Three months on the river. And we. We had a.

153
00:25:57,63 --> 00:26:08,56
We had a lot to offer. We expect we were the sort of front line. If you like to call it that we were.

154
00:26:08,56 --> 00:26:16,75
We were we went to the blockade on the river. The. Tasmanian wilderness society organized. The race. They.

155
00:26:16,75 --> 00:26:25,24
They got the boats together they train people in nonviolent action they had camps they organize supply lines.

156
00:26:25,24 --> 00:26:38,64
Radio communications. It was a beautifully done. Job and. We did our part by doing the work up front.

157
00:26:41,97 --> 00:26:51,94
With the police and the workers and the barges that came up the river. And of course. Educated and.

158
00:26:51,94 --> 00:27:02,35
I think another generation. Almost you could say of. Of young. Astray and. Because it was it was.

159
00:27:02,35 --> 00:27:09,45
Holiday time and students from all over the country came to help with the blockade. And we.

160
00:27:09,45 --> 00:27:22,42
They had this crash course of environmental awareness. And environmental action. And of course then.

161
00:27:22,42 --> 00:27:39,06
That came pain went on to nineteen eighty three. Until the labor government. One office. And put a stop to.

162
00:27:39,06 --> 00:27:46,18
Well they didn't they actually quite put a stop to it but. Signalled their intention to stop.

163
00:27:46,18 --> 00:27:54,23
And there was followed a protracted legal process in the high court. Eventually stopping the.

164
00:27:54,23 --> 00:28:22,04
Struction the destruction. Can we pause for a minute. Quite true.

165
00:28:22,04 --> 00:28:33,17
I hope they're right but i think it's quite true that nimbin has been the breeding ground of green extremists.

166
00:28:33,58 --> 00:28:45,47
Yes and i think that's one of its major contributions to a story in society. I mean if you look back.

167
00:28:45,47 --> 00:28:55,1
If you look at the twenty years since. Aquarius. There's been an enormous leap in. Environmental awareness.

168
00:28:55,1 --> 00:29:02,9
Throughout the whole country. It's. It's now. Mainstream that a way in this. It wasn't there twenty years ago and.

169
00:29:02,9 --> 00:29:12,76
And i think named and played a very the people in named and played played a major role in getting that awareness.

170
00:29:12,76 --> 00:29:24,55
Happening. And continuing it. And i hope. Will continue to play a role in the future. So yes.

171
00:29:24,55 --> 00:29:33,38
There they can be labeled as extremist we can be labeled as extremists but. We feel that.

172
00:29:33,38 --> 00:29:42,79
These are extreme times i mean what we saw was it was unbridled exploitation of resources.

173
00:29:42,79 --> 00:29:51,1
Natural resources which are really the commonwealth. They're not the to be taken by.

174
00:29:51,1 --> 00:29:58,33
Vested interests someone out there for a quick buck. They belong to all of us they belong to our children.

175
00:30:00,73 --> 00:30:17,87
And we weren't prepared to stand by and. You know see see them and raped. Absolutely no apologies. Big thing.

176
00:30:17,87 --> 00:30:28,27
There's lot. So the vision. The vision. You know twenty years ago and and.

177
00:30:28,27 --> 00:30:36,54
The years since then have brought waves of new settlers. Bringing their ideals and visions for the for the.

178
00:30:36,54 --> 00:30:50,06
For the future and. I've mentioned. I've mentioned the home building and the environment. As.

179
00:30:50,06 --> 00:30:53,9
Some of the things that people got involved in.

180
00:30:56,49 --> 00:31:04,31
Well there were lots of other visions they really spread across across the whole spectrum of human activity

181
00:31:04,31 --> 00:31:23,2
and endeavor and. Ranging from home birth. For instance birthing. We wanted to see our kids. Born in a stress free.

182
00:31:23,2 --> 00:31:34,8
Nonclinical. Environment. So. Home birthing. And again we're sitting in the building where. Home birthing was born.
