1
00:00:10,36 --> 00:00:26,22
We're ok. Berthing yes. It's hard to go home birthing was another aspect of this vision.

2
00:00:26,82 --> 00:00:34,87
I mean we were really looking at cradle to the grave. And.

3
00:00:34,87 --> 00:00:45,93
So women were dissatisfied with the present with with the situation as it was then. They wanted to.

4
00:00:45,93 --> 00:00:54,92
Birth the children in in a loving. Nonclinical. Atmosphere. They didn't want.

5
00:00:54,92 --> 00:01:03,28
Birthing to be considered a case for hospitals. It was really. To be seen as a natural thing.

6
00:01:04,12 --> 00:01:10,87
And in many cases there was no need for hospitals. I mean it was still recognize the hospital said the place.

7
00:01:11,39 --> 00:01:21,65
Something went wrong. So. So home birthing became a very strong movement here.

8
00:01:22,7 --> 00:01:31,71
Run by women who are having children and. Those women as the children grew up with their inner g.'s when.

9
00:01:31,71 --> 00:01:44,38
Somewhere else were replaced by other women. And that's continued to this day. So that's birthing then. Education.

10
00:01:44,38 --> 00:01:48,47
I think i mentioned earlier that. We started the community school.

11
00:01:50,4 --> 00:01:58,91
People were really concerned with a vacation that children were being educated in the broad enough. You know.

12
00:02:01,39 --> 00:02:21,62
Non ridge amended. More flexible way. And so we set up our own schools and. We also. Started to see the whole.

13
00:02:21,62 --> 00:02:28,92
Of all the activities in the area as part of our education. And our children's education it was a sort of a.

14
00:02:31,04 --> 00:02:42,37
A university of life. And so people would hold workshops and. People would visit. Each other's places.

15
00:02:42,37 --> 00:02:53,69
To different crafts. We were probably a little. Earthier then. Than we are now. It was very much back to the land.

16
00:02:53,69 --> 00:02:57,03
And while that's still a very strong element. Now.

17
00:02:58,16 --> 00:03:08,37
There's a lot of diversification and a lot of other interests as well. So there was a dick ation.

18
00:03:08,37 --> 00:03:19,31
The university of life in the field. Practical sort of learning. I've lost the thread.

19
00:03:23,62 --> 00:03:38,88
What else can i tell you about the right to write. Ok. Ok. Yeah. So.

20
00:03:38,88 --> 00:03:47,87
Another aspect of of the values was the way we live. What sort of. Houses we leave the.

21
00:03:49,65 --> 00:03:55,46
You know how we did our gardens and. How we integrated outside but the inside so.

22
00:03:57,66 --> 00:04:04,07
Because of economic circumstances as much as anything else those a whole range of.

23
00:04:04,07 --> 00:04:16,05
You know they do have ideas that flowed into the building. The field of being. And people were very conscious of.

24
00:04:16,05 --> 00:04:24,19
Passive solar design use of. Benign materials materials that were ecologically sound.

25
00:04:26,94 --> 00:04:36,99
And used a lot of recycled materials things that. At that time. Very much undervalued. You know.

26
00:04:37,84 --> 00:04:48,07
Buildings would get demolished and the. And the timber would get burned. So people put together houses.

27
00:04:48,07 --> 00:05:04,81
Using a whole range of these different materials. People build houses that were open plen a lot of use of lofts.

28
00:05:04,81 --> 00:05:18,52
Lots of verandas. Borrowing from traditional straight in country style. Lots of. Use of alternative energy.

29
00:05:19,2 --> 00:05:24,15
And many of these houses were located on properties that were way off the grid.

30
00:05:24,15 --> 00:05:39,15
So there's no power no water no services. So people began to. Uses a solar panels.

31
00:05:40,06 --> 00:05:48,26
With battery banks for their twelve volt systems to park their lights and their sound systems

32
00:05:48,26 --> 00:06:08,9
and so on solar hot water. They used wind power many of the properties were located in the foothills. Around the.

33
00:06:09,3 --> 00:06:19,22
Mountain ranges are on the forested areas. And they became. In a sense the protectors of the forest.

34
00:06:19,22 --> 00:06:30,37
Such as at the rainier anyway these properties were ideally suited for. Water park. Because there'd be streams.

35
00:06:30,37 --> 00:06:39,66
Running out of these. Rain forests which. Never dried up. And so. If you put a. Pelton wheel into them.

36
00:06:39,66 --> 00:07:01,56
You could harness. Hydropower. And so that they'd use that as their energy source. Such a variety.

37
00:07:02,8 --> 00:07:15,9
You know there are pharaohs samin as they sling in forest. That sort of look somewhat like mushrooms they're organic.

38
00:07:15,9 --> 00:07:27,1
And the years of. Stain them with. You know. Mosques and stuff and they. They blend in beautifully.

39
00:07:28,45 --> 00:07:35,25
I mean i'm particularly keen about recycling. Cereals.

40
00:07:35,25 --> 00:07:42,76
Often with in the case of timber the recycled materials better than anything you can buy all the best trees were cut.

41
00:07:42,76 --> 00:07:58,52
Years ago. And the team has really good quality season. And very strong local hardwoods. Through figley strong. Then.

42
00:07:58,52 --> 00:08:06,7
Then there's all the cabinet making the members. Which you can sell the jaw off. Fall and logs.

43
00:08:06,7 --> 00:08:13,93
Red cedar for instance you can still fire. And red cedar lying around. That was cut. Years ago.

44
00:08:16,4 --> 00:08:22,12
A favorite house very difficult to actually pick something out.

45
00:08:24,44 --> 00:08:29,89
I haven't thought of it in those to him so that's why doesn't the doesn't come to me i'm sure there is one

46
00:08:29,89 --> 00:08:44,66
but i i just can't think of it as a feat. Well. I mean there have been amazing. House building feats. In terms of.

47
00:08:44,66 --> 00:08:52,44
Just getting things built. There's a little stone cottage. Tangible which is build on top of cliff.

48
00:08:52,44 --> 00:09:01,78
And every stone and every piece of material. Was brought up by flying fox. That.

49
00:09:01,78 --> 00:09:08,69
That was a real feat and it was built by a woman. A frail. Not for a i shouldn't call a frail but a slightly built.

50
00:09:08,69 --> 00:09:17,83
Young woman build a. Pole frame construction on steep.

51
00:09:17,83 --> 00:09:28,9
Relatively steep hillsides with poles that are seven or eight meters long. You know thought sort of three storey.

52
00:09:28,9 --> 00:09:42,34
Split level. Construction. Amazing energy. To put these things up. And to have had the guts to stick with it next lee.

53
00:09:42,34 --> 00:09:55,28
Get it built. Because most of these people have no previous. Building experience. They become they become very.

54
00:09:55,28 --> 00:10:02,05
Multiskilled on the land. You know there's so much to do there are so many. Manual tasks you.

55
00:10:02,05 --> 00:10:12,23
Very quickly to handle two thousand and. Improvise and. So there's been a lot of that. Yes.

56
00:10:12,23 --> 00:10:27,35
Many great feats of building. Oh yes many of these building.

57
00:10:27,6 --> 00:10:33,46
Well i mean there are buildings that on finish that were started eighteen years ago.

58
00:10:34,44 --> 00:10:42,73
And growing i mean this is another aspect of this style of building it's. It's organic. It grows and it.

59
00:10:42,73 --> 00:10:53,27
It fluctuates according to needs. You know the. The. It might start off with a single person who then becomes a couple.

60
00:10:54,33 --> 00:11:00,89
And you know so there have to add extra space. And then. Children come along and more space.

61
00:11:00,89 --> 00:11:10,05
And they discover more and more about their environment and their immediate surroundings so things.

62
00:11:10,05 --> 00:11:20,85
Get modified and improved to take advantage of the northeast libris the winter sun. Those sort of things.

63
00:11:21,37 --> 00:11:34,07
So many buildings. Gone for many years. I think very few are ever built full stop.

64
00:11:34,07 --> 00:11:51,33
You can only do that with a brick veneer you can do that with the sort of buildings we're talking about.

65
00:11:51,33 --> 00:12:05,48
Well you know i realize that. It's sort of. I realize that it's. Twenty years now since aquarius.

66
00:12:05,48 --> 00:12:13,37
But that in itself is just the date. I mean. Things have been moving and changing all the time.

67
00:12:13,37 --> 00:12:24,03
And will continue to do so the vision that we had in those early years in the seventy's.

68
00:12:24,03 --> 00:12:31,84
I think in many ways has been fulfilled though. Not precisely as we thought.

69
00:12:31,84 --> 00:12:42,32
You know things are always changing it's a state of flux of growth of learning and. I see the next twenty years.

70
00:12:42,32 --> 00:12:53,3
As a continuation of that same process. But i see the acceleration. I actually don't think. Contrary to.

71
00:12:53,3 --> 00:12:58,78
You might hear all sorts of things about nieman and one of the things is that. Nothing's happening here.

72
00:12:58,78 --> 00:13:10,55
Well you know i have my thing around a lot of things happening in the sort of pulse of mean that i know there are a lot

73
00:13:10,55 --> 00:13:18,38
of things going on in all sorts of directions. You know.

74
00:13:18,38 --> 00:13:25,19
Alternative energy rainbow power companies going from strength to strength and.

75
00:13:25,19 --> 00:13:36,44
You know the future is in no alternative energy. I know the mainstream is still hooked. To nonrenewable resources.

76
00:13:36,44 --> 00:13:47,09
But it's having to confront. You know the difficulties that. That are facing those that are coming here and.

77
00:13:47,09 --> 00:13:53,03
So people like the rainbow power company are becoming more and more relevant to the mainstream.

78
00:13:56,73 --> 00:14:07,87
And so there are all these aspects of our lifestyle that are still developing. There has been no full stop.

79
00:14:07,87 --> 00:14:15,28
Nothing has really been. Achieved. And therefore you can put aside. Everything is still continuing.

80
00:14:15,28 --> 00:14:32,00
And growing and evolving. Well i don't know if you. That's appropriate to say because most of us.

81
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:43,66
In the beginning that. Beginning wave. Weren't teenagers. We were in fact. You know. Early twenty's on.

82
00:14:43,66 --> 00:14:59,6
To late thirty's. And so a lot of us have. Have reached middle age when you know now. Getting long of tooth and.

83
00:15:02,83 --> 00:15:20,97
But i hope not weary of life. And a lot of kids are grown up here and. While many of them. Leave name been.

84
00:15:20,97 --> 00:15:34,45
They take away. The spirit of name. And the values and. The sort of aquarian. Values. And many of them come back.

85
00:15:35,27 --> 00:15:41,23
Many of us middle aged ones also leave and go to other places.

86
00:15:43,04 --> 00:15:53,95
And we hear of friends all over the place doing similar things throughout. What they were doing here but often.

87
00:15:53,95 --> 00:16:07,2
Often in the mainstream people in government departments. You know various. Community organizations.

88
00:16:07,2 --> 00:16:20,45
Basically still moving. In the same direction still looking for alternatives to the dominant paradigm.

89
00:16:20,45 --> 00:16:27,22
Which is you know. Which is failing us. And and. So they're looking for alternatives.

90
00:16:27,22 --> 00:16:35,62
The evidence of that failure is everywhere about us. And i think.

91
00:16:36,04 --> 00:16:51,17
So i see nimbin as continuing to pursue these concerns. Environmental energy. Schooling. Thing. Recycling.

92
00:16:51,17 --> 00:17:00,9
You know we've set up a recycling center in the village. With very concerned with.

93
00:17:00,9 --> 00:17:15,92
Waste management in general are we going to keep evolving. Community structures. You know. Got a thriving. Artist.

94
00:17:15,92 --> 00:17:31,45
Artistic community. Got the school of arts with the. Many many musicians. Many painters. Craftspeople.

95
00:17:31,45 --> 00:17:47,01
All of those things are continuing to be developed. And i think as. As the the world economic and environmental crisis.

96
00:17:48,23 --> 00:18:01,68
Becomes more apparent. So the mainstream will look more and more to places like nimbin. For the solutions.
