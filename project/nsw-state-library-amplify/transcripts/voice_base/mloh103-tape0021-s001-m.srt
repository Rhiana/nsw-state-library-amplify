1
00:00:13,66 --> 00:00:23,69
Yeah. Well in terms of that. The early days and we were all pioneering tog's who is sort of. You could class. Credit.

2
00:00:23,69 --> 00:00:32,36
Classified as rugged individualists to. Strangely enough wanted to live together and share their lives together and.

3
00:00:32,36 --> 00:00:36,08
One example of that was a local farmer that.

4
00:00:36,08 --> 00:00:39,57
When my new arrangement with him where we could direct humphrey on his land.

5
00:00:39,57 --> 00:00:44,23
And he would get some of the company for his cattle and. We would use the rest of it somehow.

6
00:00:44,23 --> 00:00:49,43
Comfrey was going to be the miracle plant of the seventy's and eighty's and whatever and.

7
00:00:49,43 --> 00:00:53,47
So we got they way that country plants are ready to play that he'd plant up the paddocks that was loose

8
00:00:53,47 --> 00:00:57,34
and things like that and we started planting and then we.

9
00:00:57,34 --> 00:01:01,41
Then we realized we weren't sure how the irrigation would work and have all of this.

10
00:01:01,41 --> 00:01:05,89
They run off from these dayroom with seed and water and so on would get to each plant.

11
00:01:05,89 --> 00:01:08,16
I mean the story in that paddock about fifteen

12
00:01:08,16 --> 00:01:15,33
or more of us all with a different idea of exactly how the irrigation to what the two of us just know a little bit go

13
00:01:15,33 --> 00:01:17,26
there particularly.

14
00:01:17,26 --> 00:01:23,05
I did is a carrier of guys who are getting company should work that sort of gives you know idea of the sort of.

15
00:01:25,5 --> 00:01:30,37
I suppose those were the early days in terms of us understanding had group decisions work and all of that

16
00:01:30,37 --> 00:01:32,86
and we were determined to use consensus but.

17
00:01:32,86 --> 00:01:40,67
We didn't have a clear idea of the prices that we could use to get to some sort of decision so you know we just i get

18
00:01:40,67 --> 00:01:43,17
in the sun for two and.

19
00:01:43,17 --> 00:01:49,22
And until everyone got really really frustrated i think and decide on something or maybe the family came along

20
00:01:49,22 --> 00:01:57,61
and sort of the set i can't remember. Anyway then. Oh yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:57,61 --> 00:02:02,93
I mean we in the early days up of course because we were just beginning in there were a lot of decisions to be mine

22
00:02:02,93 --> 00:02:09,63
and we didn't know each other that well. But. But also because we were just beginning is that.

23
00:02:09,63 --> 00:02:15,68
Mating and using consensus. We met for a full day every. Week. Meetings.

24
00:02:15,68 --> 00:02:20,03
We did have an agenda and things like that and. Gradually got the hang of having one per cent of the scylla type.

25
00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:27,92
Take the role of. Guarding the meeting. So on whereas these days. We make for half a day.

26
00:02:27,92 --> 00:02:34,02
Maybe only a few hours once a month and. So that's just the.

27
00:02:34,02 --> 00:02:41,74
Just the changing and need to spend time in decision making.

28
00:02:41,74 --> 00:02:49,64
And we were before the china as well one interesting thing that means.

29
00:02:49,64 --> 00:02:53,63
Saying that the early people were calling me a meeting.

30
00:02:53,63 --> 00:02:59,33
That's true of the sort of the people that came within the first four or five years.

31
00:02:59,33 --> 00:03:07,86
And then there was a sort of a gap and. A bunch of different sort of people moved on after six or seven or eight years.

32
00:03:08,02 --> 00:03:12,49
And these people sora set up community they saw water systems in the ground.

33
00:03:12,49 --> 00:03:17,99
Roads working as a sort of community that had its rules and structure as a way of making decisions together.

34
00:03:17,99 --> 00:03:22,82
Set of friendships a past history. Happening. Established buildings.

35
00:03:23,07 --> 00:03:30,64
The whole way of life that they could just move into. Greit now and and. Very cheap and.

36
00:03:30,64 --> 00:03:36,98
Just totally inviting into a different sort of person i'm not saying. In any way.

37
00:03:36,98 --> 00:03:44,79
You know in fear or anything like that. Lovely people and different. And that's. Course a little bit of.

38
00:03:49,38 --> 00:03:55,27
Not exactly friction but. Disgruntled with some tell and because the advantage of being a pioneering person.

39
00:03:55,27 --> 00:04:01,79
In some ways is that you're looking around and looking at how things are going and taking initiative.

40
00:04:01,79 --> 00:04:07,23
Really being responsible for what's around and really being engaged with the land with the community.

41
00:04:07,9 --> 00:04:12,47
You know whether it's a process of being together or relationships or something that needs doing when the land

42
00:04:12,47 --> 00:04:14,11
or building that we. Neha whatever.

43
00:04:14,56 --> 00:04:23,06
Where is the sort of second type of people if i can call them that doesn't tend to engage in that same way.

44
00:04:23,06 --> 00:04:28,88
So easily sets taken from me. Just prompting people saying hey. If you want to contribute.

45
00:04:28,88 --> 00:04:30,87
Have that building a visitor's hess.

46
00:04:30,87 --> 00:04:35,42
That have a great thing and things that were immediately apparent to me just would.

47
00:04:35,42 --> 00:04:38,25
Apparent to them because it all looks set up and their point of view.

48
00:04:39,13 --> 00:04:47,73
Where is my vision is still going to be running amok. And i imagine. I'm not quite so.

49
00:04:47,73 --> 00:04:51,25
Well i'm not quite sure what to imagine but that will go.

50
00:04:51,25 --> 00:04:54,25
We'll go into some other phases that attract a different sort of person again

51
00:04:54,25 --> 00:05:03,42
and that will bring it's an interesting dilemma is and. Compromises and so on.

52
00:05:03,42 --> 00:05:22,36
This is what we decided in the early dice part of our idealism and then more than idealism. That.

53
00:05:22,36 --> 00:05:30,11
Knowing he could run their house that they built. We don't have shares we just have donations.

54
00:05:30,11 --> 00:05:35,1
And you can't likely do anything except what you can sort of carry off and you can more or less.

55
00:05:37,61 --> 00:05:43,21
And that's what people have had to do people who have left. Have left. So you can say with nothing.

56
00:05:43,21 --> 00:05:49,84
Will die some have been given money as well. But by sickly the it is known on issues of houses is a policy.

57
00:05:49,84 --> 00:06:00,55
Which means that we as a community. My. Might give some money. To a departing. Member or may not and. That was part of.

58
00:06:00,55 --> 00:06:04,67
That was idealism thing well it wouldn't be great to write down the structure of land

59
00:06:04,67 --> 00:06:10,81
and i'm an issue going to strategy because it just seems to increase the gap between rich and poor

60
00:06:10,81 --> 00:06:14,89
and of course lots of trauma in society and. It seems wrong who.

61
00:06:14,89 --> 00:06:21,25
You know he says we can and then what a ridiculous notion in a way. But it was also thinking that.

62
00:06:21,25 --> 00:06:24,55
Well that would show you were really committed if you come into this community and you.

63
00:06:24,55 --> 00:06:28,51
You knew that you couldn't speculate on it.

64
00:06:28,51 --> 00:06:35,2
Infected with worse and you couldn't depend on more he way with anything at all. And so it meant that no one could.

65
00:06:35,2 --> 00:06:38,8
Would come here. Because i really just wanted to live with us.

66
00:06:38,8 --> 00:06:44,68
Which seemed like a principle criterion as far as we're concerned by things the idealism

67
00:06:44,68 --> 00:06:48,84
and wanting to change the world in the practical thing of having people who are committed.

68
00:06:48,84 --> 00:06:55,49
But that has made a lot of difficulty in recent years with for example my ex partner.

69
00:06:55,49 --> 00:07:04,41
Mother of my boys who grew a way from the community didn't want to participate in one of the sort of. Guy strata.

70
00:07:05,08 --> 00:07:13,23
What if you had say. And. And who nonparticipation really began to an annoying other people.

71
00:07:13,23 --> 00:07:17,22
But how can you make someone participate and so on.

72
00:07:17,22 --> 00:07:23,79
And she started saying well i want to leave but i want money for the house which we built together.

73
00:07:23,79 --> 00:07:31,22
And we decided that that was fair enough and then a woman or a couple came that really wanted to leave here

74
00:07:31,22 --> 00:07:38,65
and they said yeah well that's fair enough. We'll pay the community some money for the privilege of living in that.

75
00:07:38,65 --> 00:07:44,8
Already built house and not having to build one and. The community can decide whether to pass it on to my ex.

76
00:07:44,8 --> 00:07:52,46
And that's what happened. But. They were very worried about that setting a precedent.

77
00:07:52,46 --> 00:07:55,85
But by protests far as i'm concerned both president's been sitting there.

78
00:07:55,85 --> 00:07:59,03
People are going away with nothing and going away with something so.

79
00:07:59,03 --> 00:08:03,11
It leaves the pair and the hands of the community which. I'm really happy with.

80
00:08:03,11 --> 00:08:07,85
At the moment because i think we make decisions really well.

81
00:08:07,85 --> 00:08:15,77
We do listen to each other carefully and spend time when there is an important decision to be married. And.

82
00:08:15,77 --> 00:08:19,75
So i thought i have a lot of confidence in that i'm aware that it could go.

83
00:08:19,75 --> 00:08:34,92
Could go wrong with i'm not quite sure how at the moment. We will lose. The legal structure is that it.

84
00:08:34,92 --> 00:08:37,11
For a minute for around lawyers.

85
00:08:37,11 --> 00:08:41,31
Solicitors point of view it would be almost impossible for someone to take control of the land and try

86
00:08:41,31 --> 00:08:48,41
and sell it from under us we've set up a structure that is both confusing and very fickle too. To reward.

87
00:08:50,18 --> 00:08:52,09
But then in terms of.

88
00:08:52,09 --> 00:08:54,09
Sanctioning anyone's behavior we have

89
00:08:54,09 --> 00:09:00,34
when you have nothing at all nothing legal at all whereas for example estrada title or something like that does this.

90
00:09:00,34 --> 00:09:04,51
All the rules that a community might make up on the strata title get fixed in the lore

91
00:09:04,51 --> 00:09:09,51
and they can call in the place to enforce it and we can do that. And we've through a big thought.

92
00:09:09,51 --> 00:09:24,19
Strange about having to do that really. Bit. Last august. Yeah. That's when a lot to us.

93
00:09:24,19 --> 00:09:33,08
Of course has been pretty thick. Preaching between people and misunderstandings and. Hurt and anger.

94
00:09:33,08 --> 00:09:42,11
But there is this climate in which i have a time things get result people to do the hates die down they go

95
00:09:42,11 --> 00:09:51,91
and talk to each other and. And work things through integrated disagree or whatever. And i think that's.

96
00:09:51,91 --> 00:09:54,64
That's a function of. You know i values.

97
00:09:55,2 --> 00:10:08,57
And just who happens to have come here but it's also a function of who was the truth or. See it so.

98
00:10:08,57 --> 00:10:16,23
It's also a function of the size of the group and. We have twenty adults here and with about twenty children.

99
00:10:18,09 --> 00:10:23,88
Which means that i family. A lot of sole parent families and you come here.

100
00:10:26,72 --> 00:10:34,16
And i think if it got up to about thirty adults would find factions forming. Fairly wary of that.

101
00:10:34,16 --> 00:10:39,09
So net net so always have a great conflict because there's lots of lovely people i'd love to come and live here.

102
00:10:39,84 --> 00:10:48,27
People some of whom i feel much more affinity with than some of the men with you know about. You know.

103
00:10:48,27 --> 00:11:02,44
Oh yeah ok well the first thing is when in a way to stop but. A little bit.

104
00:11:02,44 --> 00:11:07,16
Means movement is a name is often in question and i think it's worth questioning because it's not.

105
00:11:07,16 --> 00:11:15,1
It's not like a normal political movement with. With a particularly agenda and i know. In a political organization.

106
00:11:15,1 --> 00:11:22,22
And people joining in a much as a rule or petition or something it's more.

107
00:11:22,94 --> 00:11:30,55
And that's totally appropriate in what's called the men's movement because. Because while.

108
00:11:30,55 --> 00:11:33,85
Women had to find their strength and power into saudi i'm able to stand up

109
00:11:33,85 --> 00:11:42,73
and be counted said a spray can be tied properly and so on we respected men in general had that.

110
00:11:42,73 --> 00:11:46,86
What white men didn't have was an ability to be more introspective

111
00:11:46,86 --> 00:11:56,89
and say life is an inner journey as much as an outer chief meant and. And so i lodged.

112
00:11:56,89 --> 00:12:01,68
A mess picked of the men's movement. Is more than a personal growth.

113
00:12:01,68 --> 00:12:08,1
Coming down to what i understand oneself as a man and. As a human and as a as being alive on this wonderful planet.

114
00:12:08,1 --> 00:12:13,17
This time and so on. So i've been involved.

115
00:12:13,63 --> 00:12:20,8
With working with man and being with with men in sort of consciousness raising groups. For about eight years.

116
00:12:20,8 --> 00:12:29,83
And that kind that of. Running groups. Called the spade to impel and graves.

117
00:12:29,83 --> 00:12:35,98
That was particularly focusing on one's emotional response to the state of the planet particularly the possibility of

118
00:12:35,98 --> 00:12:46,34
nuclear war in those days. And that can lead to just being part of green protests and.

119
00:12:46,34 --> 00:12:50,75
Realizing that we needed to know each other better and to communicate better to really.

120
00:12:50,75 --> 00:13:03,08
Protest effectively says that are working with people and learning. And training and so on. You know i don't know.

121
00:13:03,08 --> 00:13:07,44
Not in particular more this area not this.

122
00:13:07,44 --> 00:13:13,3
This communities a particular buddy from communities particularly socially and environmentally only into it and.

123
00:13:13,3 --> 00:13:19,08
If you make a list of all the projects people. Members have been involved with it's really long and quite impressive.

124
00:13:19,08 --> 00:13:29,03
But in terms of getting into and working with i mean there's one other man that was living here at the time

125
00:13:29,03 --> 00:13:36,05
and sort of a member called cane. And he and i had discussed.

126
00:13:36,05 --> 00:13:39,65
How women seem to have you having such a good time together in their in their groups

127
00:13:39,65 --> 00:13:44,3
and their workshops i have that are women and we were sort of envious and jealous and.

128
00:13:44,3 --> 00:13:48,63
So it can men really have friendships that same as close as women seem to be and.

129
00:13:48,63 --> 00:13:55,04
You know that's what i was asking myself can i have camaraderie with. With men without having to go to war for.

130
00:13:55,04 --> 00:14:01,2
It was a real question. I had no idea of. I really wanted. Whether it was possible.

131
00:14:02,32 --> 00:14:07,48
I thought one of the first workshops we organized which was a long weekend workshop was called the ends that way again.

132
00:14:07,48 --> 00:14:15,57
Then within that it was on. Was only anzac day weekend. And when we true. If you leave. Looking at power and authority.

133
00:14:16,44 --> 00:14:16,83
Can you not

134
00:14:16,83 --> 00:14:21,98
but having had experience with designing money which helps we design one particularly for men with all sorts of excel

135
00:14:21,98 --> 00:14:30,78
as that would bring these issues up and we can discuss and discover more about ourselves as men. And we had to be turn.

136
00:14:30,78 --> 00:14:39,19
Bet twenty five men came along and we put them through all sorts of exercises and. Yeah.

137
00:14:40,59 --> 00:14:47,11
One of the principle exercises we used in that. We're shot was what we called a circle of us elation.

138
00:14:47,91 --> 00:14:55,18
And it more or less was a reenactment. Just acting out in a panic. What happens to a boy in a mile as he grows up.

139
00:14:56,14 --> 00:14:58,34
So we go. First of all but.

140
00:14:58,75 --> 00:15:03,93
So the matching around militarily like you have to get do at school or you might if you went to cadets and so on

141
00:15:03,93 --> 00:15:09,41
and telling them off and so on then we asked them to just sort of mill around and break into pairs

142
00:15:09,41 --> 00:15:12,14
and look at each other's. Look.

143
00:15:12,14 --> 00:15:16,78
Looking at each other's eyes and imagine the other person childhood friend and he thought about that and then.

144
00:15:16,78 --> 00:15:25,5
Break up again and. Look in another man's eyes and imagine in them to be. The teacher that last year around. And then.

145
00:15:25,5 --> 00:15:34,29
Maybe the adolescent that. That was you believe me when i've only gradually built up a picture of the.

146
00:15:34,29 --> 00:15:43,54
Different events in miles life. That tend to push to draw them into isolation drive them into.

147
00:15:43,54 --> 00:15:51,05
Having to take care of themselves and not and and. Be wary of everyone else especially other miles.

148
00:15:51,05 --> 00:15:54,39
Which happens in all sorts of i've it uncover why.

149
00:15:54,39 --> 00:16:02,31
And then we go to everyone to get in a circle facing outwards to sort of a tight circle and just start walking.

150
00:16:02,31 --> 00:16:09,00
Until you can no longer see any just in your peripheral vision maybe you could see another man so we're very wide

151
00:16:09,00 --> 00:16:13,17
circle and much panic and ask them to feel what that was like my.

152
00:16:13,59 --> 00:16:20,26
Express it in some way peeing in others who are just yelling and screaming and others were just silent and and.

153
00:16:20,26 --> 00:16:22,38
Just standing there feeling it.

154
00:16:22,38 --> 00:16:25,35
Because they've been in the group we've been sharing they walked away from it

155
00:16:25,35 --> 00:16:28,38
and that was just sort of mirrored for us.

156
00:16:28,38 --> 00:16:32,44
What it's been like growing up from feeling close and exactly whose small room valued and.

157
00:16:32,44 --> 00:16:35,28
Being able to share and being able to be in moment and so on.

158
00:16:35,28 --> 00:16:40,5
To being a man where you know i said i didn't you take care of yourself and you got to be in control and.

159
00:16:40,5 --> 00:16:43,82
And you kind of cry and so on and.

160
00:16:43,82 --> 00:16:49,59
Quite a powerful exercise numa good men to turn around face each other maybe make eye contact way across the paddock

161
00:16:49,59 --> 00:16:53,8
and start walking in and see what that feels like and. You know for myself.

162
00:16:53,8 --> 00:16:58,92
Although i feel the agony at being on the outside of the circle i also felt real apprehension of coming back in class

163
00:16:58,92 --> 00:17:07,48
because i was so i felt there that was what i was used to. And so we did. Sort of.

164
00:17:07,48 --> 00:17:14,82
Coming closer and there was joy in that. And when we sang together in a beach other and so you know that's one.

165
00:17:14,82 --> 00:17:22,92
One exercise that. Kim and i have often used in workshop scenes. This to dramatically illustrate what happens to me.

166
00:17:22,92 --> 00:17:29,37
To them so it's because most men don't even realise that that's happened i didn't like it's a process of.

167
00:17:29,37 --> 00:17:43,46
Like a fish discovering what water is. Well let's let's walk on site it's really a movement to speak.

168
00:17:43,46 --> 00:17:46,91
It's just a whole different main that are quite interested in.

169
00:17:48,34 --> 00:17:53,98
Well i might come out of a broken up relationship with suddenly realising that got no one to talk to in the apartment

170
00:17:53,98 --> 00:17:59,99
and has lots of support where they might really think you know i'd like to be friends with men

171
00:17:59,99 --> 00:18:10,54
and not have this sort of stand off. Beer in hand relationship. In terms of that. And so it's.

172
00:18:10,54 --> 00:18:13,17
I don't know what to say about it in this area and this is still.

173
00:18:13,18 --> 00:18:19,5
A lot of men most of who know each other because it's only a small group so if i may be a couple of hundred.

174
00:18:19,5 --> 00:18:25,41
Who are willing who really want to look at themselves as men understand themselves as women find out what it is to be a

175
00:18:25,41 --> 00:18:32,32
little. You know. In a generation. Because everything else has been. They all roles.

176
00:18:32,32 --> 00:18:36,89
Has been ripped away from a sort of being the provider and so on

177
00:18:36,89 --> 00:18:42,58
and even the protector can easily be because that involves going to war in a kind of free with that anymore.

178
00:18:42,58 --> 00:18:46,27
So i can no longer be a provider or. Or protect an it necessarily.

179
00:18:47,14 --> 00:18:51,57
And why that before that the industrial revolution and so on ripped away.

180
00:18:51,57 --> 00:18:54,2
The ancient traditions of what it was to be a man.

181
00:18:54,47 --> 00:19:00,38
I passed on here to each that we've sort of more or less lost remans i think has been more intact because.

182
00:19:00,38 --> 00:19:02,02
From mother to daughter.

183
00:19:02,02 --> 00:19:06,2
Mothers and daughters tended to stay at home and share things with men are seen as they got old enough

184
00:19:06,2 --> 00:19:09,07
or at work who are the factories. The apprenticeship system.

185
00:19:09,07 --> 00:19:15,12
Perhaps kept up a bit of the old traditions of what is history and then but that's broken down these days as well.

186
00:19:15,12 --> 00:19:18,8
So it's refining and also just making it press room for.

187
00:19:18,8 --> 00:19:22,19
What sort of relationships we won't win each other let's try them. You know.

188
00:19:22,19 --> 00:19:32,36
And that's been a fantastic thing to be involved with i love nearly every moment of it really enjoy it being paddled

189
00:19:32,36 --> 00:19:39,91
facilitating means groups just weekly groups where particular thing. Used.

190
00:19:39,91 --> 00:19:49,09
You know like father being a father and father or father in law.

191
00:19:49,09 --> 00:19:56,96
Or one's own father or mother or six zero zero six and intimacy.

192
00:19:58,04 --> 00:20:05,49
All work or just untold number of frames we can used as a discussion point. And there's a lot of exercises and.

193
00:20:05,49 --> 00:20:20,37
Things we can do together have fun to get to know each other better. That's greeted with a lot of suspicion.

194
00:20:20,37 --> 00:20:21,35
Because this.

195
00:20:21,35 --> 00:20:27,28
Rampant fear in men are getting closer because they've been trying not to be so they get very angry if i say i mean.

196
00:20:27,28 --> 00:20:34,74
Doing what they were told not to me and that generally critz gets called homophobia which is.

197
00:20:34,74 --> 00:20:39,55
Is a sort of misnomer that's generally supposed to mean fear of guy i mean.

198
00:20:39,55 --> 00:20:45,36
But i think it's really fear of each other the fear of other men in general women especially.

199
00:20:45,36 --> 00:20:48,72
Fear of any man that says well i'm quite happy.

200
00:20:48,72 --> 00:20:57,58
Being uncomfortable being close and talking about intimate things with you. So there's that reaction and this is all.

201
00:20:57,58 --> 00:21:08,8
Personally i've had very little. Almost no criticism from women. About what i do. And i know other men that have.

202
00:21:08,8 --> 00:21:23,1
So i think it's. You know i'm not sure why that is that. I'm quite you know i. In terms of feminism i'm really feel.

203
00:21:23,1 --> 00:21:29,6
I i would write that. To feminist think is and all the women that have put their lives and their family and.

204
00:21:29,6 --> 00:21:37,74
And selling on the line to make changes. You know society. The second feiss that made. And and steal.

205
00:21:37,74 --> 00:21:43,46
I also react to some elements of feminism with this seems to be a business against me in that i would call sort of

206
00:21:43,46 --> 00:21:49,47
sexist. Because it is this generalized generalized distrust. Which i can understand.

207
00:21:49,47 --> 00:21:58,49
But when i'm talking with a thinking woman i expected her to rise above that and. But i've really come across that.

208
00:21:58,49 --> 00:22:01,88
Bitterness aimed directly at me. In what i do.

209
00:22:01,88 --> 00:22:08,55
Mostly this incredible support because women seem to be able to see much more easily than men can.

210
00:22:08,85 --> 00:22:16,7
What influences on men from birth and also how men behave. Evidently because of them. So i do teach.

211
00:22:16,7 --> 00:22:21,00
Men's issues in thai sometimes in other places and and.

212
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:27,18
You know the way a locked case is just actually draw out other people's experiences and the women can talk.

213
00:22:27,18 --> 00:22:34,47
Much more easily about. What i would call means oppression. Then the main. In general in the classes.

214
00:22:34,47 --> 00:22:41,99
And then it can be quite a painful topic for. Quite a few people to do. So. So the different responses.

215
00:22:41,99 --> 00:22:48,21
I think in mine lee out of one's personal pine in the area of gender. This goes back generations.

216
00:22:48,21 --> 00:23:09,52
But with different genders are sort of. Done to each other expected to each other. We didn't have a set s.

217
00:23:09,52 --> 00:23:14,43
It was out to be self-sufficient vegetables and fruit or whatever with that was never.

218
00:23:14,43 --> 00:23:21,55
Well i would call but he thought. They were really more accurately coolest buddy village or something like that.

219
00:23:21,55 --> 00:23:27,49
That's a great relief i think it's a bit of a mistake to put so much of it into something for what.

220
00:23:27,49 --> 00:23:33,57
To me is a fairly sort of a shall i go to be self-sufficient not rather be integrated not think most people here.

221
00:23:33,57 --> 00:23:36,91
Would rather feel that they're making a difference to society as a whole

222
00:23:36,91 --> 00:23:46,82
and therefore a part of society rather than going outside saw him trying to be separate. So yeah.

223
00:23:46,99 --> 00:23:54,98
For myself having young. Tweens and getting a party together of course i went on the dollar many of us did to survive.

224
00:23:54,98 --> 00:23:55,77
And.

225
00:23:55,77 --> 00:24:00,32
I suppose a critic might say why don't you go out get a job to earn the money to come back and then do the pottery

226
00:24:00,32 --> 00:24:06,96
and so on but i just was. Motivated to get this community up and running i didn't want to leave it for a moment.

227
00:24:06,96 --> 00:24:16,41
I really wanted to be part of it. Every day and. And that meant. You know i couldn't money.

228
00:24:16,41 --> 00:24:18,86
Just being there until i got the pottery up such as me living there

229
00:24:18,86 --> 00:24:23,00
and being on the dollar you know i got kicked off the golf more

230
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:28,76
or less for that attitude i suppose in those days they were encouraging people to set up businesses of their own.

231
00:24:28,76 --> 00:24:37,51
And so really before i had finished the pottery buildings to my satisfaction the market. Efficient. Sort of factory.

232
00:24:37,51 --> 00:24:46,34
Got kicked off and we went on again. That's my partner and months later because we just had to you know.

233
00:24:47,2 --> 00:24:52,05
So social security is really being unable to our community get to get up

234
00:24:52,05 --> 00:25:03,02
and running as quickly as it has to be very high. To run in money and build this price as well. And we feel. Well.

235
00:25:03,02 --> 00:25:07,77
We can justify that in the sense that well at least we're constructing something with that money from the government if

236
00:25:07,77 --> 00:25:15,85
you like something of lasting importance and. So now not so many people on the dial. And the one.

237
00:25:15,85 --> 00:25:22,33
There was a school because they all had the pottery going. Couldn't say it was very lucrative. And there was another.

238
00:25:22,33 --> 00:25:26,58
Business he called if it was trading which was importing things from india

239
00:25:26,58 --> 00:25:31,76
and also making up your creams unless i enjoy it so that. That was supporting some people.

240
00:25:35,46 --> 00:25:42,39
Besides that they've been really industries. Well in the community. People have gone out to work.

241
00:25:43,52 --> 00:25:55,56
And that's how it is now. With people working in these moral the area and teaching the whole range of different things.

242
00:25:55,56 --> 00:26:01,84
The buddy buddy buddy made this. Synonymous with enlightenment or understanding.

243
00:26:01,84 --> 00:26:04,00
The truth or something like that

244
00:26:04,00 --> 00:26:09,39
and so we knew more arrogant moments we can call ourselves from as of enlightenment you know i think.

245
00:26:09,39 --> 00:26:16,2
I sort of shifted where shrinking it was so shocking that. You know in some ways you could say that. You know we've.

246
00:26:16,2 --> 00:26:26,25
We've helped start preschools and. Forest. Saving organizations and. Home birthing plea.

247
00:26:26,25 --> 00:26:35,01
Things and hot politics conferences and. Well manner of things. So in that way. In terms of.

248
00:26:35,01 --> 00:26:40,85
Relative enlightenment press we've helped along the way a little bit where.

249
00:26:40,85 --> 00:26:52,68
What was the angle of your question the just body thing. You know it's a nice clean. Relates to shorten. Increase.

250
00:26:53,93 --> 00:27:00,42
And i think most people here are sort of proud of it and. There is such a thing as group morale and.

251
00:27:00,42 --> 00:27:04,3
Good you feel about the place and which includes head would you feel about the layman the image that we have.

252
00:27:05,44 --> 00:27:10,93
And generally we do feel good about it we've been criticized by the more i'm feral.

253
00:27:10,93 --> 00:27:13,99
When he say he peace in the hills as being middle class and

254
00:27:13,99 --> 00:27:21,57
and to each one of them in the said middle class upper class think you know just taking the heat out of it. But. That.

255
00:27:21,57 --> 00:27:28,17
And that's because we read and learn. We have had slightly different values then.

256
00:27:28,17 --> 00:27:35,98
You could say the alternative society in general we. Because we haven't had dived on the place.

257
00:27:36,66 --> 00:27:41,5
And we've been you know part of running these meditation retreats and so on so.

258
00:27:41,5 --> 00:27:57,15
Sometimes we've been criticized as being pure and. Things. You know ridiculous things like that. With. Oh.

259
00:28:01,48 --> 00:28:11,89
Well most people here. We're aware of the situation in the world where and. By sickly that. The west.

260
00:28:11,89 --> 00:28:21,16
Lives on the back of. Goodwill and. Through the institution of. A third world debt and and.

261
00:28:21,16 --> 00:28:24,5
Differing process for commodities and peoples labor and so on.

262
00:28:26,05 --> 00:28:29,68
And we're also well aware that there's limited resources in the world

263
00:28:29,68 --> 00:28:34,97
and that not everyone can be brought up to a western standard. With a cow or fridge. You know.

264
00:28:36,75 --> 00:28:44,41
All the things that we enjoy in this country. Just the. The environment is groening.

265
00:28:44,41 --> 00:28:49,36
Bearing that at the moment mean and possibly for your pot little and if we bring all of india and china

266
00:28:49,36 --> 00:29:01,23
and so on up to that standard. So the only way. In terms of that. Environmental outlook on a global outlook to. To.

267
00:29:01,23 --> 00:29:07,11
A lot to be sustainable on this planet is for people to expectations in the last else to drop a bit.

268
00:29:07,11 --> 00:29:09,77
And so we've sort of consciously done that.

269
00:29:09,77 --> 00:29:17,05
But then the other side of that is that it's just like jesus said it's easier for a camel to hold through the eye of a

270
00:29:17,05 --> 00:29:19,65
needle and it is for rich men to get into heaven this is the truth

271
00:29:19,65 --> 00:29:27,57
and that is that too many material possessions clottey or. You know laws. Tend to make more attached to things.

272
00:29:27,99 --> 00:29:34,93
And therefore it's not so easy to change and move with a way where you need to go in on your spiritual journey and.

273
00:29:35,77 --> 00:29:41,18
So those two values that are going to mingle with each other the global perspective in a spiritual perspective.

274
00:29:41,18 --> 00:29:52,16
To mean that. And they come down to. That there is some benefit in having a simpler lifestyle. Less material position.

275
00:29:52,97 --> 00:30:07,39
Less pressured lifestyle. Say i don't consider. I consider myself pretty rich.

276
00:30:07,39 --> 00:30:13,17
I've been thinking about this recently because i've been working in time.

277
00:30:13,57 --> 00:30:19,01
And just thinking about other people's lives compared to my own and where i don't. I don't have very many overheads.

278
00:30:19,01 --> 00:30:20,67
It's true i don't own my house.

279
00:30:20,67 --> 00:30:26,74
But i'm not putting out anything on a date and anything i belong to it just stays there for many years and.

280
00:30:26,74 --> 00:30:30,69
So my wage guys a lot further.

281
00:30:30,69 --> 00:30:36,33
In other people's money who are renting or paying off a mortgage or whatever a little and running to them.

282
00:30:37,25 --> 00:30:45,03
Buying the newest gadget. So i consider myself a really wealthy. Bicycling because i'm pretty happy with what i've got.

283
00:30:45,03 --> 00:30:45,52
But.

284
00:30:45,52 --> 00:30:50,38
But more than that because i have instead of putting all my work into superannuation

285
00:30:50,38 --> 00:30:53,45
and so on i put it into establishing a community around me

286
00:30:53,45 --> 00:31:02,25
and my security is in the money so much as the people in my life. Time will tell which ones in a bit a bit of it.

287
00:31:02,25 --> 00:31:10,89
For the moment i much prefer this one thank you.
