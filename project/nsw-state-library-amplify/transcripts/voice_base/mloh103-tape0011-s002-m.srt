1
00:00:14,04 --> 00:00:24,13
I suppose associated with that poverty headspace. Is the concept that. Money is bad money's evil. That.

2
00:00:24,13 --> 00:00:37,28
The whole idea of. Counting and being aware of money. As i thing is is an evil process. And that then.

3
00:00:37,28 --> 00:00:44,54
Develops a desire to not knowing a whole poverty headspace. Because it's in its more moral.

4
00:00:44,54 --> 00:00:53,57
To be poor or to at least think your poll. Is more moral. Thing that strikes me about that poverty headspace.

5
00:00:54,23 --> 00:01:00,38
Is that it misses a couple of really important issues that are not of the poverty headspace

6
00:01:00,38 --> 00:01:09,04
but of the money being evil. And suffice. Money of course doesn't exist anywhere in the first place.

7
00:01:09,04 --> 00:01:17,87
That's a total figment of our imagination. Other than the pipe out that doesn't exist and the print.

8
00:01:17,87 --> 00:01:24,39
That is sitting on it. If we didn't know the language that it was written in.

9
00:01:24,39 --> 00:01:29,79
If we were from somewhere else it could be just as much as the classic of toilet paper.

10
00:01:30,49 --> 00:01:37,95
It doesn't actually have any value in itself and doesn't really exist. It's purely the.

11
00:01:37,95 --> 00:01:46,79
Figment of our imagination and the value that our imagination puts on it. If all the money in the world. Was destroyed.

12
00:01:46,79 --> 00:01:53,32
At the moment. The world would not be one bit. Poorer.

13
00:01:53,32 --> 00:01:59,36
We would still have all of the cars all of the houses all of the. Everything's that we actually use.

14
00:01:59,36 --> 00:02:08,35
We would not have lost one thing. But the whole place would be in total confusion. Total mass. Total depression.

15
00:02:09,12 --> 00:02:18,07
Everyone would be totally lost and i will. Because of one particular magic. Somehow because of this. We had lee.

16
00:02:18,07 --> 00:02:23,98
Figment of our imagination thing called money. People. Each morning.

17
00:02:23,98 --> 00:02:33,98
Billions of them actually get out and go out and work long hours and. Try really hard.

18
00:02:33,98 --> 00:02:41,95
In order to get these pieces of paper because they trust that somehow having these pieces of paper. They trust that.

19
00:02:41,95 --> 00:02:50,64
Other people will give them. All the things that they want. Up to that level. So that. Money. In fact. Creates trust.

20
00:02:50,64 --> 00:02:58,14
Amongst four billion people. Every morning of the day. Because of money.

21
00:02:58,14 --> 00:03:05,00
Four billion people think they can trust each other to some degree. At least a little bit.

22
00:03:05,00 --> 00:03:28,43
Anything that creates that much trust. Cops be all bad. But i also bought a systems.

23
00:03:28,43 --> 00:03:35,54
Have the inherent problem of having the thing that you actually want in the other person's hand right at that time.

24
00:03:35,54 --> 00:03:40,68
The systems beyond that of the credit system this way.

25
00:03:40,68 --> 00:03:47,45
You know are in fact transferring laiva from one person to another.

26
00:03:47,45 --> 00:03:57,25
Basically require a good solid computerize ation and an awareness of what work is being done in the community.

27
00:04:00,34 --> 00:04:08,35
You can have it. Working as a. Occurs in the cities. At the moment. Amongst tradesmen who in fact are working.

28
00:04:09,4 --> 00:04:17,95
With a child up on other projects anyway. And so they're aware of the. Quality level of the other people and.

29
00:04:17,95 --> 00:04:22,49
That i essentially getting. Part of their spending.

30
00:04:22,49 --> 00:04:31,53
What they might be doing godling landscaping they're getting part of their regular spending part. Dealt with simply by.

31
00:04:31,53 --> 00:04:33,21
Live about from one to another.

32
00:04:34,5 --> 00:04:43,2
But that's really a fairly specialized in those circles where they know each other already. The real challenge.

33
00:04:43,2 --> 00:04:52,02
To get a community working well in terms of i live employment a high unemployment. Valley.

34
00:04:52,02 --> 00:04:56,11
Getting the actual an employment level to drop. For instance.

35
00:04:56,11 --> 00:05:02,77
The challenge with that is to actually take in the economics of the whole valley.

36
00:05:02,77 --> 00:05:06,95
To understand what is occurring economically throughout the whole valley.

37
00:05:06,95 --> 00:05:22,08
Into their full have sense of understanding of reality of what this life. Credit is really doing. In the everyone.

38
00:05:22,08 --> 00:05:30,11
In the work. Economics. In the. Everyone getting up every day and going. And working. Economics.

39
00:05:31,59 --> 00:05:36,53
And you actually build up a visual picture of the whole valley.

40
00:05:36,53 --> 00:05:42,97
And what's occurring and the people doing all these different work spot that. You couldn't do it without i can.

41
00:05:42,97 --> 00:05:54,65
As a pretty complex computer level. And you would therefore. Expect a fair degree of. Telephone connection through.

42
00:05:54,65 --> 00:06:04,61
To the to the various parts of the community. Enough to actually satisfy a constant contact. Into the computer.

43
00:06:04,61 --> 00:06:22,77
To verify any any. Important transactions. That whole. Option. And sort of. Has the the comprehensive complexity.

44
00:06:22,77 --> 00:06:28,29
Where a lot of people in the existing community.

45
00:06:28,29 --> 00:06:34,87
Would want to keep talking and arguing about whether that was a good idea for five hundred years if they could.

46
00:06:36,18 --> 00:06:39,18
The level of questions that would come out.

47
00:06:39,18 --> 00:06:45,34
About whether that was definitely what the whole community should do would run forever.

48
00:06:45,34 --> 00:06:52,88
The only way to actually test that out would be. To do it to. Floated as a test place.

49
00:06:53,32 --> 00:07:01,19
But getting enough people to agree about that float. It would mean that you would actually have to.

50
00:07:01,19 --> 00:07:10,27
You would have to see a million dollars in materials and either live or go in to get it to actually be tested.

51
00:07:10,27 --> 00:07:22,35
You know as well why because in order to keep away from that house. Problem. And the. Live value. Past problem.

52
00:07:22,51 --> 00:07:35,81
You would actually have to have some form of currency. In the transaction currency. Swap between that.

53
00:07:35,81 --> 00:07:43,11
Internal credits and. The dollar. If you didn't have that.

54
00:07:43,11 --> 00:07:51,97
Then people would be lieve losing their freedom from poverty. And i would be caught. And i would.

55
00:07:51,97 --> 00:07:55,75
All this work was outdoing would be nontransferable.

56
00:07:55,75 --> 00:08:04,38
And just like the house that's only worth a half or a third of what it's really worth. But i would likewise.

57
00:08:04,38 --> 00:08:10,48
With all their libre. Be caught in a situation where they would. We have to transfer the value.

58
00:08:11,06 --> 00:08:16,71
That's why at the moment you've only got in the eyes. Bought a credit. Systems that are occurring.

59
00:08:17,07 --> 00:08:24,03
People can only afford to do maybe a quarter. A fifth of their total lie about. In that way.

60
00:08:24,36 --> 00:08:31,37
But in him and with such a huge employment unemployment problem. One quarter one fifth.

61
00:08:31,37 --> 00:08:50,37
Might be very good but that's not going to solve. The question here. We get it this. Is. The first.

62
00:08:50,37 --> 00:09:04,34
The first problem with. Getting. Tunnel falls legal and. In existence. I was am requirement. Of the cooperative.

63
00:09:04,34 --> 00:09:16,23
Registrar that trying to shy cancel. Had to give its approval. To the development. They had to give its approval to.

64
00:09:16,23 --> 00:09:21,9
I lodge number of houses being built on this one property.

65
00:09:21,9 --> 00:09:28,1
Which technically up to that time when a family normally being a lad. In three or four houses.

66
00:09:29,58 --> 00:09:41,18
And the registrar of car produce was saying that therefore. It might be illegal it might be. I reduce.

67
00:09:41,18 --> 00:09:46,15
If a lot of people hundreds of people bought shares in a car for dave that was and they are going to be

68
00:09:46,15 --> 00:09:58,25
and i had three of four houses. So we had to go to trying to shock cancel and. Luckily we had a doctoring.

69
00:09:58,25 --> 00:10:08,35
And health department. Building inspector who was very supportive and friendly and helpful. And i suppose it.

70
00:10:08,6 --> 00:10:12,24
It's likely helped in the background economics of the whole place that.

71
00:10:12,24 --> 00:10:19,39
The property had not yet been purchased and now purchase. Would be dependent upon. The approval being given.

72
00:10:20,57 --> 00:10:30,5
Also the particular property. He's in a separate valley from the name and. Town and. Actual name and valet.

73
00:10:30,5 --> 00:10:43,16
Side had eye. Privacy. For the rest of name than. Really out of sight out of mind. You know. In a large pot. And aside.

74
00:10:43,16 --> 00:10:54,47
In the event. Yeah i put forward the submission and. Spoke a little bit and. Luckily this.

75
00:10:54,47 --> 00:10:59,25
Extremely conservative rural. National party country party at that time.

76
00:11:01,32 --> 00:11:13,83
The shire and agreed to a stratus largest commune. Being established inside to run your shot. Well.

77
00:11:13,83 --> 00:11:20,87
It was initially about a thousand and forty ton of all foals. Was it.

78
00:11:20,87 --> 00:11:26,23
It was initially about one thousand and forty if i remember. Ickes.

79
00:11:26,23 --> 00:11:38,45
The original purchase price was right by the owner in the process of the seven months. Between the original agreement.

80
00:11:38,45 --> 00:11:48,07
And the final. Signing of the transfer of contract. Documents. It was. I think it.

81
00:11:48,07 --> 00:11:52,79
I think it changed up to one hundred six thousand dollars. The thing.

82
00:11:52,79 --> 00:11:59,29
He did just on one hundred thousand or just below. And gotten it done.

83
00:11:59,29 --> 00:12:06,59
So there's a thousand acres one hundred thousand essentially. One hundred dollars an acre. For.

84
00:12:06,59 --> 00:14:15,84
What was the hof forest. I guess the reason why i did not style. Town of all. It's it. That's. That's a double.

85
00:14:16,12 --> 00:14:25,96
It's not is that simple that i had to because my level of friendships. At town of all falls. Such that.

86
00:14:25,96 --> 00:14:33,01
I never at any particular time decided to not study a ton of befalls.

87
00:14:33,01 --> 00:14:40,77
Because i new york a wiseguy back at any time that i wanted. But i'd never actually build a house a ton of them.

88
00:14:40,77 --> 00:14:48,7
Because i was too. Involved trying to get various community projects going. And so i had never had a house.

89
00:14:49,53 --> 00:15:00,16
And so i went i then got involved with the. Bush factory. Starting the co-operative down here.

90
00:15:01,5 --> 00:15:11,5
And it was obviously going to need a huge amount of if it and. Just in time and. All the long bits and pieces.

91
00:15:11,5 --> 00:15:15,9
And also at that time. Because i was on this most city council.

92
00:15:15,9 --> 00:15:24,65
And having a place down here at the factory mention that. I didn't have a slight hitch. Because i didn't have a cot.

93
00:15:24,65 --> 00:15:35,38
And i was hitching into council meetings. And not having a saw to hitch. It was suddenly a very useful. Sort of.

94
00:15:35,38 --> 00:15:51,56
Easy step. Easy change. Oh. Well. It was in north in seventy six. That. Bob matias.

95
00:15:51,56 --> 00:15:54,74
Who had been the policeman during the aquarius festival.

96
00:15:56,02 --> 00:16:03,93
And had now been transferred by the police department out to more radio. Some such place. And had.

97
00:16:03,93 --> 00:16:11,84
Therefore decided that he had to sell them all but a factory in name and. And i was approached by.

98
00:16:11,84 --> 00:16:20,51
Bessel height asking whether i wanted to have it and. I had beene.

99
00:16:22,28 --> 00:16:32,03
Working on the registration now if i had in fact to yes receive their instruction. Of bush cooperative.

100
00:16:33,36 --> 00:16:40,66
The i'm a bush property. Going to concentrate on job creation and.

101
00:16:42,29 --> 00:16:50,57
So we've looked at a possible shop operator in the center of town. And that didn't work out. At that particular time.

102
00:16:51,62 --> 00:16:57,19
And then suddenly this often came up. And so i said that well.

103
00:16:57,19 --> 00:17:00,5
When i said to him straight away yeah that's great

104
00:17:00,5 --> 00:17:09,11
and took it along to our coverage of making the car pretty sort of said well that sounds great idea how we got him.

105
00:17:09,11 --> 00:17:18,15
Finance it. And we arranged errands for the whole thing to help put your ass. Was.

106
00:17:20,92 --> 00:17:30,11
The development of the factory and his running. I suppose the. The first thing that was occurring here.

107
00:17:30,11 --> 00:17:42,23
Was bush supplies. Which was i.e. Food. I think call party of business. That began a ton of before us.

108
00:17:42,23 --> 00:17:50,39
And had been part of the essential group that had become involved to register. To form bush cooperative.

109
00:17:52,28 --> 00:18:01,28
And it was the first use in the old cold. Cauldrons. Of the bought a factory. And following on from that.

110
00:18:01,28 --> 00:18:09,68
In pretty quick close succession. He was that he would push the eta and some of the end times. We should design.

111
00:18:10,37 --> 00:18:18,54
Some elaine times. Was started by. Bob craven and patricia size.

112
00:18:18,54 --> 00:18:30,87
Who picture she is now one of the key workers in this more eco. And. That i started the silent times. With i.

113
00:18:30,87 --> 00:18:39,78
Couple of other people. And. Worked it right through until finally some of the end times close i started.

114
00:18:39,78 --> 00:18:47,5
As i think sometime in seventy seven or seventy eight. And ran through to ninety ninety three and three shiny four.

115
00:18:48,15 --> 00:18:58,97
And then the theatre. And lighted the theatre and gained a sort of café restaurant with. And their recording studio.

116
00:18:59,89 --> 00:19:19,83
And. Lyta our studios in a candle workshop. Photographic. Workshop. And i'm semi artistic. Semi. Of all.

117
00:19:19,83 --> 00:19:33,85
The candles and beautiful but i suppose it's more. Of just a normal. Production business. Those. You know.

118
00:19:33,85 --> 00:19:44,43
Well like i haven't really stuck together in there come in. It's certainly not as though i had begun. The.

119
00:19:44,43 --> 00:19:53,7
That is businesses that were most of them started. I under the umbrella of the bush car party.

120
00:19:53,7 --> 00:20:02,39
But at a certain point of time. The bush darpa devoted itself out of existence. Decided to wind down.

121
00:20:02,39 --> 00:20:10,51
And it voted for the factory to be turned into a strata total. Instead of by. And barak offered it as a whole.

122
00:20:12,06 --> 00:20:20,82
And then. The individual rights groups were then naggin first option. On the particular. Spices.

123
00:20:20,82 --> 00:20:35,99
That i using at that time. And most of them stayed and continued. Oh yes it was originally company out strata of.

124
00:20:38,76 --> 00:20:46,61
Bill and. A close was the interest for the sinai. Well it was an interesting.

125
00:20:46,61 --> 00:20:56,82
It was an interesting development it's it's certainly been very successful. And it started in.

126
00:20:56,82 --> 00:21:06,53
I suppose it's out of the century because. I'd been looking at. The questions with the corporative.

127
00:21:06,53 --> 00:21:13,9
At the bush factory. And one of our options instead of going to strada total. At bain to really develop.

128
00:21:13,9 --> 00:21:20,07
My company title. And because of.

129
00:21:20,07 --> 00:21:22,08
Various arguments we ended up going strada

130
00:21:22,08 --> 00:21:26,39
but in the process of that i'd really looked at the question of company title.

131
00:21:26,39 --> 00:21:35,91
Which is i talk of taught all that is very common in eastern suburbs sydney. Of all the flights.

132
00:21:35,91 --> 00:21:40,49
That will go before start to talk to existed which was only in the sixty's i think.

133
00:21:40,79 --> 00:21:51,4
At the for that all of those flights and being. Iran used illegally and a company tata. And i had odd.

134
00:21:51,4 --> 00:21:59,79
Sudden i connected the idea of the company title. Through into i walk advancing. And.

135
00:21:59,79 --> 00:22:09,69
Suggested talk to about that with a tiny part got a and. Hey felker. That didn't work and. That was.

136
00:22:09,69 --> 00:22:25,42
Was i a good combination and. So i then set about designing. In the broad sense. Of all of the. Of the bill includes.

137
00:22:25,42 --> 00:22:28,78
Community. Looking at that. For the right piece of land.

138
00:22:29,04 --> 00:22:38,65
And i suppose that place of vanier's chosen mainly because of my. I ate huge amount of. Individual privacy.

139
00:22:39,32 --> 00:22:46,59
That it gives to sun many and i had one hundred houses. But they've all got such a huge sense of privacy.

140
00:22:47,54 --> 00:22:56,85
We've got a full spectacular. Especially of sunsets. And. It could do that.

141
00:22:56,85 --> 00:23:02,82
On a property that was going to be a very very little. Economic use. For anyone else.

142
00:23:04,13 --> 00:23:16,71
It was laying that would basically be wasted as a as a farm. Because it was such a rough. Property. That.

143
00:23:16,71 --> 00:23:27,01
Farming would be continually just. I hear. I also felt that it. The property would continually have a weed problem.

144
00:23:27,01 --> 00:23:37,00
In terms of laying town or lots of noxious weeds and. That because of that. One of the best ways was to get it off.

145
00:23:37,00 --> 00:23:46,34
The sort of cattle land. Which didn't really. Cope with that. And get it into. I crossed a village.

146
00:23:46,34 --> 00:23:55,54
That would have one hundred families interested in. Beautifying. The different parts of the valley.

147
00:23:55,54 --> 00:24:37,19
And i think that's worked very well that way. So. Oh oh. Oh. I search me. Yes. After some years. Bill and then.

148
00:24:37,19 --> 00:24:44,86
Made arrangements with the lismore city council to become a strata title. After starting off as a community title.

149
00:24:44,86 --> 00:24:52,89
That's hard as a company talking. There was another. Option which would become a valuable now.

150
00:24:52,89 --> 00:24:59,76
But which at the time when they really wanted to make the change. Was not about. I knew talk or title called.

151
00:24:59,76 --> 00:25:15,39
Community title. Which was basically i heard of that company. Title. On a multiple occupancy. But with i.

152
00:25:15,39 --> 00:25:25,01
A specific example with a specific. Fixed. Around me and see if a company title. Can be any number of a range months.

153
00:25:25,01 --> 00:25:31,03
Of that. Whatever your lawyer chooses. And likewise before it existed.

154
00:25:31,03 --> 00:25:37,65
The strata taught all strata title was one particular company title. Which was then fixed by law.

155
00:25:37,65 --> 00:25:45,57
As always having this particular patent. So therefore a solicitor. Could not just change. Some small parts of it.

156
00:25:45,57 --> 00:25:53,86
Which created by. Confusion. And likewise community title is another of those except that it's designed for out.

157
00:25:53,86 --> 00:26:03,22
Door areas without. Interconnecting buildings. Strata title is for places where there is. Walls.

158
00:26:03,22 --> 00:26:13,44
That are shared walls and such things. So. They didn't have community title. At the time. And billing cliffs.

159
00:26:13,44 --> 00:26:21,06
Chose to become part of the start of title. In the process of doing that and most likely will.

160
00:26:21,06 --> 00:26:32,91
At fixing their relationship to each other more. Then on i. General. Commune modoc walk up and say in this area.

161
00:26:32,91 --> 00:26:39,99
Because a lot of the. Desire a lot of the desire to not address questions. In the early days of newman.

162
00:26:41,02 --> 00:26:51,89
Was a desire for greater freedom. That when setting up town of all falls we had the place paid for.

163
00:26:51,89 --> 00:26:57,18
Well there was a sort of one natural. Wing. Which said ike i well.

164
00:26:57,18 --> 00:27:02,19
We've made enough decisions to get the place pipeful we don't need to make any more decisions now.

165
00:27:03,28 --> 00:27:09,21
Now we can just let the place be free and just let the place do whatever it wants to and i'm the let me be free

166
00:27:09,21 --> 00:27:16,8
and do whatever i want to. And i promise not to hurt anyone else and.

167
00:27:16,8 --> 00:27:21,04
Their reality is that when you have that many people living together.

168
00:27:21,04 --> 00:27:24,11
You always have conflicts and differences of opinion.

169
00:27:24,11 --> 00:27:30,73
No matter how much people try not to hurt each other because people always look at.

170
00:27:30,73 --> 00:27:36,93
Things in their life magazine trickly. I can't. It's impossible.

171
00:27:36,93 --> 00:27:42,71
Whenever i've in their eyes i look at everything i guess enter clee then we see the world from where their eyes are at

172
00:27:42,71 --> 00:27:53,03
the time. And automatically whenever they look at things occurring between their house and. The street the road.

173
00:27:53,75 --> 00:27:57,68
They look at the mega century clee. So they have differences of opinion an argument.

174
00:27:58,16 --> 00:28:00,91
And that sort of question comes back to.

175
00:28:00,91 --> 00:28:10,83
Do you try to suggest a structure to minimise those differences of opinion and i. Humans. Just as.

176
00:28:10,83 --> 00:28:19,53
You create a structure for traffic. On roads. To try to minimize the number of accidents.

177
00:28:19,53 --> 00:28:31,19
You know this is not mass individualists and i think. If you look at history. The point about history is that.

178
00:28:31,19 --> 00:28:38,16
Every time you move from something like no magic society. We've curry's. Around this district. And then.

179
00:28:38,16 --> 00:28:45,13
Even if you take those same people. And put them in an agrarian society.

180
00:28:45,13 --> 00:28:50,56
Where the farms are fixed and where they can't just follow the kangaroos.

181
00:28:50,56 --> 00:28:53,07
Across the whole valley and kill them wherever they want because

182
00:28:53,07 --> 00:28:59,35
when i go from one to the other they're on someone else's farm. Even if you look at it. In that terms.

183
00:28:59,35 --> 00:29:08,64
It takes a different set of moral ethics. To live in an agrarian society than. In an emetic society.

184
00:29:08,82 --> 00:29:17,76
And it takes another set of moral ethics to live in a mechanical or a post mechanical world. The greater freedom.

185
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:20,83
If you want to have absolute freedom of anything.

186
00:29:20,83 --> 00:29:26,36
Of any action that you want to take at any time you need to live by yourself. You need to leave.

187
00:29:26,36 --> 00:29:31,32
As non-medically as you possibly can as far away from other people.

188
00:29:31,32 --> 00:29:39,1
Because if you don't then there'll be some differences of opinion at times. And that will restrict your freedom.

189
00:29:39,1 --> 00:30:03,00
In some way. And this is a whole series of. You know. Come back to when. You think. You know the way that newman is.

190
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:21,43
You. You know the image of the commune. I mean everyone sharing. So much everything. Is. It's really strange to.

191
00:30:21,43 --> 00:30:34,76
Test that out in reality. And whether. What part of that sharing. Was as limited as into a small household.

192
00:30:34,9 --> 00:30:45,22
How much of that sharing like a plane. Was then limited by. Ok but let's not make any rules. That. The sharing is.

193
00:30:45,22 --> 00:30:50,47
Ike i will agree to share as long as i can have as much as i want. All right.

194
00:30:50,47 --> 00:30:59,19
I see that this sharing in the question of how much sharing was occurring in the early days is immediately.

195
00:30:59,19 --> 00:31:07,46
Intricately linked with. The question of freedom. I you sharing something. If you can have as much as you want.

196
00:31:09,43 --> 00:31:18,1
It goes back to then the number of people. As the number of people have increased in the valley. The continual lesson.

197
00:31:18,1 --> 00:31:25,94
It keeps keeps coming that. We need to really share. Now no i mean really share this time.

198
00:31:25,94 --> 00:31:29,57
We need to really share where you can't have just. Any think that you.
