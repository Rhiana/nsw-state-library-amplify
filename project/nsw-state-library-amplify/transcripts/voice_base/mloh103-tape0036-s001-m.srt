1
00:00:17,48 --> 00:00:27,65
What it will last three months.

2
00:00:27,65 --> 00:00:32,06
I don't think there ever will be a pepsi needs to be another name in festival but it

3
00:00:32,06 --> 00:00:38,62
but it's interesting to speculate i think the. The two thousand will obviously be and i mean to stop. You know.

4
00:00:38,62 --> 00:00:41,7
Not not too often dealing through the change of a millennium.

5
00:00:41,7 --> 00:00:48,15
But it'll be a momentous time for a strike because it does represent the. This and in the theater rationing and.

6
00:00:48,15 --> 00:00:52,74
As all the point is after a time to a straggler to look to.

7
00:00:52,74 --> 00:00:57,33
You know to what its future is going to be in the twenty first century. That.

8
00:00:57,33 --> 00:01:00,98
It's interesting i think that the celebrations that do happen

9
00:01:00,98 --> 00:01:05,05
and i'm convinced that they'll be fairly interesting celebrations way though the way the way of.

10
00:01:05,05 --> 00:01:07,75
Hosting the olympics in the year two thousand and not i think.

11
00:01:07,75 --> 00:01:11,99
I thought exactly relevant but i think that the celebrations will happen anyway.

12
00:01:11,99 --> 00:01:17,83
But i think it will be very much about.

13
00:01:17,83 --> 00:01:21,35
Seeing that changed role on them and who knows that there's another sort of unicef

14
00:01:21,35 --> 00:01:25,52
and i tease them on them till that time too and how much you've strayed you will get through

15
00:01:25,52 --> 00:01:31,09
and that point of time i'm not sure but i was not sure i would call that another name and i think that.

16
00:01:31,09 --> 00:01:40,12
What that celebrations are going to be that is really a straddle having arrived in southeast asia and and.

17
00:01:40,12 --> 00:01:49,34
Having grown up. And i think right now we'll find that. Very exciting i mean i think the time.

18
00:01:49,34 --> 00:01:55,13
Not too many people probably a lot of people like you with of. The forms of it i don't think too many people really i.q.

19
00:01:55,13 --> 00:01:59,54
With the fact that it's that a strategy was nasty ending on its own two feet. In spite of the world.

20
00:02:00,42 --> 00:02:04,7
And i guess the other the difference with that is is that.

21
00:02:04,7 --> 00:02:11,44
Nimbin was very much about a six in of a strike i think it was if you like that.

22
00:02:11,44 --> 00:02:15,05
What i sometimes call the same sort of antenna on the horns of a rhinoceros it was.

23
00:02:15,19 --> 00:02:20,53
Sort of people who had they had happened after sort of realized that the changes were happening.

24
00:02:21,72 --> 00:02:25,36
Dylan's line something's happening but you don't know what it is do you mr jones.

25
00:02:25,36 --> 00:02:27,54
It wasn't the whole of the straightest celebrating.

26
00:02:27,54 --> 00:02:34,24
I think in a sense in the bicentenary the step was a much more general celebration ally there were people rightly

27
00:02:34,24 --> 00:02:38,4
saying that. You know that there are certain things in australia that we you know.

28
00:02:38,4 --> 00:02:42,24
Have to think very much about what we were celebrating and why.

29
00:02:42,24 --> 00:02:45,86
To me that would celebrate as an act of it but i mean it always.

30
00:02:45,86 --> 00:02:49,67
It always big so question about what and why celebrate.

31
00:02:50,15 --> 00:02:59,02
And if you apply that to the two thousand what it leads you into is some pretty deep thinking about that.

32
00:02:59,02 --> 00:03:04,52
The framework of culture. And i think that.

33
00:03:04,52 --> 00:03:09,95
My hope for the two thousand is if there is a celebration of will be constructive wide celebration of used

34
00:03:09,95 --> 00:03:13,41
and celebration that all of stratton's can take poteen.

35
00:03:13,41 --> 00:03:19,96
And for that to be a valid celebration i think you will have to come to the ends finally with the average english you.

36
00:03:19,96 --> 00:03:22,98
And i think there are any simple answers to the aboriginal question

37
00:03:22,98 --> 00:03:27,37
but if we haven't managed to at least come to us with the treaty

38
00:03:27,37 --> 00:03:35,55
and some better understanding of aboriginal straightly by the two thousand and. Think that you know.

39
00:03:35,55 --> 00:03:40,58
We can't really have a valid revelation of struggle. So i think that'll be one dimension.

40
00:03:40,58 --> 00:03:46,24
And then the other dimension will be. We we do stand in relation to southeast asia.

41
00:03:46,24 --> 00:03:51,86
I mean in my mind the celebration for the two thousand is one with a kind of you know.

42
00:03:52,88 --> 00:03:56,23
Balinese galileans i over there and singaporean.

43
00:03:56,23 --> 00:03:59,36
Line dances over there and lying puppets are mean the names are over there

44
00:03:59,36 --> 00:04:04,78
and you know it's a celebration that acknowledges out. A place in the world.

45
00:04:04,78 --> 00:04:09,4
Not a nots festival of lively you're playing an american culture sort of you know. Transplant.

46
00:04:09,4 --> 00:04:15,05
To the supply part of the world. And one might ask why a festival state already before it reflect that.

47
00:04:15,51 --> 00:04:21,66
More than they do. But i think the times are coming. And i think that you know. The celebrations.

48
00:04:21,66 --> 00:04:27,33
Of a straight in the year two thousand and very likely i think that. I'm guessing here but in the you know.

49
00:04:28,06 --> 00:04:35,56
Saving rate using between i think battle be the dimension. We're sort of starting to realize. And grapple.

50
00:04:35,56 --> 00:04:40,8
Distantly and intellectually. With the fact a bit out of southeast asia. But we're not. Grappling with that.

51
00:04:40,8 --> 00:04:46,21
Yet in terms of. What does this mean culturally. I mean you know we we still expect.

52
00:04:47,15 --> 00:04:53,65
Asians i think to learn our language and i always knew coming to us that's ok. We haven't done nearly enough.

53
00:04:53,65 --> 00:04:59,47
Of you know going in the language and learning their ways and then. Exploring the culture.

54
00:04:59,47 --> 00:05:06,84
And as a side i just mean that ants in the in the food in the music but i mean exploring the realities and.

55
00:05:06,84 --> 00:05:11,33
I think that that's if there are any valid dimensions to.

56
00:05:11,33 --> 00:05:15,2
The celebration in the two thousand maybe that is the name of the new the two there is no doubt

57
00:05:15,2 --> 00:05:27,21
and i get frustrated with very much anymore. It's perhaps because of my expectations that.

58
00:05:27,21 --> 00:05:37,81
My expectations are no side because i think in terms of in terms of the price of this change i mean where that where

59
00:05:37,81 --> 00:05:44,15
the i don't really get. Get frustrated with it i guess because of a ride to the point where.

60
00:05:44,15 --> 00:05:50,97
I'm not just tickled enough. Anymore. I think i was when i was younger. To think that i have the answer.

61
00:05:50,97 --> 00:05:55,91
And i think we're all grappling with all these questions at many levels all of the time.

62
00:05:55,91 --> 00:06:00,97
And i don't have any magical answers for any of these things. And i don't think any one else does either.

63
00:06:00,97 --> 00:06:08,72
So the change will always be sort of you know. You know three steps forward here and two step speckly.

64
00:06:08,72 --> 00:06:15,05
I don't really get frustrated by it anymore i just say that the process is. What's interesting about.

65
00:06:15,15 --> 00:06:21,76
But i enjoy the prices enormously enjoyed the i mean i had one less fortunate people i love what i do.

66
00:06:21,76 --> 00:06:26,52
I mean i'll get izing celebrations if no one but you're paid to pay me to do it it's to do it

67
00:06:26,52 --> 00:06:31,97
but i think it's the most enjoyable thing to do that i could possibly could be doing.

68
00:06:31,97 --> 00:06:38,97
So i enjoy that the process of enormously. And always enjoy the product.

69
00:06:38,97 --> 00:06:45,26
If some celebration sort of plays me more than others. But i don't think i get frustrated by that.

70
00:06:45,26 --> 00:06:54,49
I guess sometimes i do. And i guess the nice thing about. About my current situation is that. It's cyclical.

71
00:06:54,67 --> 00:07:00,49
I mean once dealing with a program of celebrations and events through the. If it doesn't happen when you get the way.

72
00:07:00,49 --> 00:07:07,66
Quite alike all the way when you just put it aside going back to next year. And i think we finally.

73
00:07:07,66 --> 00:07:16,09
I mean my satisfaction is that i think we are finally creating it in a strange culture.

74
00:07:16,55 --> 00:07:23,38
We're finally creating that sort of land max i mean the graham dunstan sort of you know saying at one stage that that

75
00:07:23,38 --> 00:07:28,95
he's made of a celebration was. Whether it was something that you may shoot your life by.

76
00:07:28,95 --> 00:07:35,52
Interns of people say look you know i got married before this. The same to the vice and jane.

77
00:07:35,52 --> 00:07:38,97
Or are they've now had a baby.

78
00:07:38,97 --> 00:07:46,66
After name and so the month celebrations become sort of part of the measuring yardsticks of your life you know.

79
00:07:47,46 --> 00:07:53,95
And then once celebrations become a kind of a calendar that people people accept

80
00:07:53,95 --> 00:07:59,72
and that's what that's what i've always been striving to do to try and bring outdoor.

81
00:07:59,72 --> 00:08:04,44
Celebration and events to the point where people sort of accept that it's part of their lives and there's a few that.

82
00:08:04,44 --> 00:08:07,62
I think we always have i mean.

83
00:08:07,62 --> 00:08:13,99
New year's eve for a new strategy for song was sung as i can remember back to when i was a kid was always special.

84
00:08:13,99 --> 00:08:20,04
You didn't concede a gang. To be before the news you strive to be in a social situation and to be.

85
00:08:20,04 --> 00:08:22,66
There's a sense of sad and.

86
00:08:22,66 --> 00:08:29,08
Funny importance about this day that made you want to be active with it was a patio where the prison sort of you know.

87
00:08:29,08 --> 00:08:33,85
Celebration of the fireworks for the. Hundred thousand people and having abba think that.

88
00:08:33,85 --> 00:08:37,18
We had something a four hundred thousand people.

89
00:08:37,56 --> 00:08:44,9
What happened in advertising up them in just a herd instinct the people want to be together. I've always rather.

90
00:08:44,9 --> 00:08:49,93
Admired in the in the south asian cultures which. Which had that all my spilled into them.

91
00:08:49,93 --> 00:08:53,97
And i'm a man in the band spending a bit of time afternoon when i went back in spain sometimes.

92
00:08:53,97 --> 00:09:01,73
The bowels of bengal i've been in central and travelled for about three months through the villages with them.

93
00:09:01,73 --> 00:09:08,59
And i remember very clearly that he would wake up on a certain day and. Nobody needed to an answer.

94
00:09:08,59 --> 00:09:11,71
Just everybody knew that that day was a celebration day in those

95
00:09:11,71 --> 00:09:14,66
and i thought of going off into the rice fields that this.

96
00:09:14,66 --> 00:09:17,3
On this day of you and sort of you know took their plates of.

97
00:09:17,3 --> 00:09:23,96
Horrible she would went down to the river and had a picnic. And in fact.

98
00:09:23,96 --> 00:09:31,87
If there was ever an experience in my life anywhere else close to christ and him and. I went with.

99
00:09:32,57 --> 00:09:39,48
The bowels to a celebration in central maine goal called the me that when they came i was in him and they'd look to

100
00:09:39,48 --> 00:09:45,38
and they said that we were in when i went over to be in goal they took me to this meal

101
00:09:45,38 --> 00:09:49,31
or the prince that was held on the banks of the game. In this little town then of a.

102
00:09:49,72 --> 00:09:55,73
I think it was something like kind of two thousand years every year this mailer would be inhaled. And it was all.

103
00:09:55,73 --> 00:09:58,36
Determined by the noon faces in the calendar.

104
00:09:58,36 --> 00:10:02,05
Bowels right across spain goal no one needed to sort of you know to put up posters

105
00:10:02,05 --> 00:10:04,99
or to announce that the this meal that was held on this day.

106
00:10:04,99 --> 00:10:09,85
Everybody just knew i mean because that was the noon cycle this was the back going up was always help.

107
00:10:09,85 --> 00:10:15,05
And it had always been held for centuries. And this spot.

108
00:10:15,15 --> 00:10:21,52
By the river and these ancient ancient trees were always the spot that was held so i went with this person

109
00:10:21,52 --> 00:10:27,81
and asked by will and he's doing paddy the weather the way it with was very tribal i mean certain people kind of.

110
00:10:27,81 --> 00:10:33,51
You know we played host and then sort of the whole kind of tribal structure would arrive and i would look after them

111
00:10:33,51 --> 00:10:40,12
and fade them in a detain. So we arrive at about a week before the seeing and. And we've been traveling back.

112
00:10:40,12 --> 00:10:47,31
And whatever fit. You know if it. Hours and hours and finally got to the spot in a stable way here.

113
00:10:47,31 --> 00:10:48,15
Mainly it's nothing.

114
00:10:48,15 --> 00:10:55,2
Yeah well that was was a sort of you know a bit of riverbank sort of you know in the age of this saying that there was

115
00:10:55,2 --> 00:10:58,16
nothing that the eye could see for miles in any direction.

116
00:10:58,16 --> 00:11:04,68
So we've been showing that half over the next ten days you'd see these figures on the horizon i mean many people would

117
00:11:04,68 --> 00:11:08,79
walk to this thing and would leave him sort of you know for weeks before so i could walk to it.

118
00:11:08,79 --> 00:11:13,08
You just say these figures slowly coming out over the horizon it might take three four hours for

119
00:11:13,08 --> 00:11:19,09
when you first spotted them by that quest and i thought that you could actually make out any of the features

120
00:11:19,09 --> 00:11:24,92
and then slowly over the sort of ten days just this insight into how many people came to this ng.

121
00:11:24,92 --> 00:11:32,92
Hundred thousand probably ever they say you know sustains a thousand people to slowly kind of or aldin on and on for.

122
00:11:32,92 --> 00:11:37,14
You know. We're one of the few groups that can my cat i might add and.

123
00:11:37,14 --> 00:11:42,86
Just all around me this is a wonderful festival sort of took place. You know people sort of you know.

124
00:11:42,86 --> 00:11:50,84
Brought things bundles under there and sort of you know things in the ball caps and sort of all this. This little.

125
00:11:50,84 --> 00:11:58,06
City sprang up and wonderful concerts happened and wonderful banquets were held and then sort of you know the.

126
00:11:59,12 --> 00:12:03,63
Signal that a pastime for the meal at the end and justice quickly as it all happened everything packed up

127
00:12:03,63 --> 00:12:07,98
and everyone making so this little figures taking four hours to disappear on the horizon.

128
00:12:07,98 --> 00:12:13,34
And we actually stayed until after the whole thing as i have in a way to right back to being this say in the bank with

129
00:12:13,34 --> 00:12:15,88
nothing visible for miles and. Action.

130
00:12:16,24 --> 00:12:21,83
And it's that sort of thing i've always kind of a say in me and my hope all the time. What a pity.

131
00:12:21,83 --> 00:12:26,71
We don't live in a situation that has that sort of deep and instinct

132
00:12:26,71 --> 00:12:31,9
and understanding of what a pretty celebration isn't so much part of al lives that it just happens in that.

133
00:12:31,9 --> 00:12:38,45
You know i do a ball i'm questioning. Sort of why. But i think slowly that is happening.

134
00:12:38,45 --> 00:12:43,65
So these strains are creating a celebrations calendar for themselves.

135
00:12:43,65 --> 00:12:44,22
And finally

136
00:12:44,22 --> 00:12:48,99
and efforts come out of celebrations i mean not that i think we're particularly spiritual religious country

137
00:12:48,99 --> 00:12:54,24
but a minute has sort of it has picked up sort of you know traditions like christmas and whatever but.

138
00:12:54,24 --> 00:12:57,72
I think it's necessarily for that great the would be just raisins but.

139
00:12:57,72 --> 00:13:01,62
But you know they are becoming very real real celebrations.

140
00:13:01,62 --> 00:13:05,21
We do a christmas pageant down here each year that has a cast of thousands

141
00:13:05,21 --> 00:13:10,16
and sort of you know as many people turn up to it as we can possibly sort of you know feed into the place.

142
00:13:10,16 --> 00:13:13,84
And it's interesting seeing these traditions grab and it's got to the point where.

143
00:13:13,84 --> 00:13:17,68
You know people make their own costumes and so there's a communications network

144
00:13:17,68 --> 00:13:26,8
but i think if we almost if we stopped organizing it would happen. And i feel that that's that's that's sort of.

145
00:13:26,8 --> 00:13:34,06
Why don't they achieve winds of name and actually that. I mean you know. The state and a festival happened.

146
00:13:34,06 --> 00:13:40,88
To quiet the lead up and not. Twenty years later. There's a community of people who are still celebrating it.

147
00:13:40,88 --> 00:13:45,19
It's rather interesting talking to a younger generation now because they have no idea.

148
00:13:45,19 --> 00:13:47,88
I mean it's sort of an in the newman festival came out of nowhere

149
00:13:47,88 --> 00:13:54,28
and went to night with as far as i could see that in fact one other interesting story that i like quite often tell me

150
00:13:54,28 --> 00:14:02,8
in one of my trips up to me. Which was a train trip. On the overnight sort of. And all of them express up to lose more.

151
00:14:04,33 --> 00:14:09,2
I got on. Onto the train and sat down in the scary and they were sort of.

152
00:14:09,2 --> 00:14:15,05
They were sort of i to attain young teenagers so. Sitting for five yards away from me.

153
00:14:15,59 --> 00:14:23,22
And one of them was telling the story. About how i can say with he was slightly older and so he was sort of you know.

154
00:14:23,22 --> 00:14:28,56
Telling him the rights. And the story about how to suddenly on one way gained.

155
00:14:28,56 --> 00:14:34,33
All of these thousands of people all over the country just so that somehow got this mysterious signal on it all up

156
00:14:34,33 --> 00:14:43,82
and converged on him then. And in the thinking. If only it was that simple. I mean they were this mysterious.

157
00:14:43,82 --> 00:14:46,72
Of the just sort of drew people like some sort of magnet.

158
00:14:46,72 --> 00:14:52,1
And felt to me that like sort of saying hey do you realize this that of the hundreds of people who put.

159
00:14:52,1 --> 00:14:59,41
Countless i thought now let it go and put a young and old head on young sheldon's.

160
00:14:59,41 --> 00:15:06,43
But i think it's quite interesting i mean i think that. The younger generation and doesn't.

161
00:15:06,43 --> 00:15:11,79
I mean straight is not very good at preserving its own cultural history. I always feel.

162
00:15:11,79 --> 00:15:16,5
I mean partly because we're dominated by. What dylan thomas.

163
00:15:16,5 --> 00:15:21,73
Called the barrier of a common language if we didn't speak english or american. Be a lot easier.

164
00:15:21,73 --> 00:15:29,57
But because i have many of our cultural lack of facts of american films and american and my they were over the years

165
00:15:29,57 --> 00:15:34,38
and british but more recently american. We lose our own cultural history.

166
00:15:34,48 --> 00:15:41,92
I mean the people in the thirty's i mean not just the stratton's of a certain age in a certain new york if you mention

167
00:15:41,92 --> 00:15:54,68
sort of figures like. Ginsburg. Or you know that. John cage other you know the great musical figures or out.

168
00:15:54,68 --> 00:16:01,29
Because they were. And i talking about but mentioned similar. Innovators from the strategy from the thirty's.

169
00:16:02,29 --> 00:16:07,92
You know it's. Most people now you're talking about we're just. We haven't kept their cultural history.

170
00:16:08,86 --> 00:16:15,05
And i think that's continued. You know pretty much the states getting better. But i think that. I mean i actually.

171
00:16:15,23 --> 00:16:22,74
Used to always think in the afternoon been. I used to always think you know was probably a pile we friction.

172
00:16:22,74 --> 00:16:31,12
Of what happened in america and europe and. You know what. What a pity i wasn't in san francisco and missed all that.

173
00:16:31,12 --> 00:16:33,88
Because i never travel before they'd

174
00:16:33,88 --> 00:16:41,86
and in nineteen seventy five seventy six i finally scraped a few dollars together and did my pilgrimage went off

175
00:16:41,86 --> 00:16:42,65
and sort of you know.

176
00:16:42,65 --> 00:16:44,61
It's been a year travelling through the states

177
00:16:44,61 --> 00:16:48,9
and travelling through have been visiting a lot of these places that had been reading about them

178
00:16:48,9 --> 00:16:55,15
and being inspirational to me. And meeting. Meeting people who'd been inspirational.

179
00:16:55,15 --> 00:17:00,74
And we'd often spend some time at the tennessee for a stephen gaskin and sort of went off to finda

180
00:17:00,74 --> 00:17:08,96
and spend some time and to intone and you know countless other kind of you know. Cultural makers. Movement.

181
00:17:08,96 --> 00:17:15,33
And you know i sat down and talked with countless people. Woodstock etc etc.

182
00:17:15,33 --> 00:17:19,02
Then came to a conclusion i've repeated that you know what had happened in the strait.

183
00:17:19,02 --> 00:17:25,31
You know it was by no means standard to made jolly sight more interesting.

184
00:17:25,31 --> 00:17:31,75
Radio in many ways than the things that i had thought. You know perhaps were much better than they were.

185
00:17:31,75 --> 00:17:38,72
But the skill is something we never got around to making in the movie. People got around to making woodstock the movie.

186
00:17:38,72 --> 00:17:43,72
And i think that's the difference where we haven't saw it and perhaps that's a good thing.

187
00:17:43,72 --> 00:17:48,69
I guess for that reason as our cultural tradition probably is not hasn't been is distorted and exaggerated

188
00:17:48,69 --> 00:17:53,27
but you know perhaps in danger of losing it and.

189
00:17:53,27 --> 00:17:57,81
I think it's probably only fairly recently that the younger generation is starting to look past that

190
00:17:57,81 --> 00:18:03,43
and i think a lot of the a lot of the problems in the country a lot of the fact that we don't appreciate the aboriginal

191
00:18:03,43 --> 00:18:04,98
background on their regional here.

192
00:18:04,98 --> 00:18:13,13
Have to do with the fact that we have looked at our culture through the filter of the first pain

193
00:18:13,13 --> 00:18:15,05
and then american culture. And that's why i think.

194
00:18:15,14 --> 00:18:19,29
That cultural shift is so important that we are seeing a stagnant scientists

195
00:18:19,29 --> 00:18:24,74
and i think they will probably come a time when we start researching all of that and digging it out

196
00:18:24,74 --> 00:18:29,37
and saying i like a lot and we had the nimbin festival happen but. You know what.

197
00:18:29,37 --> 00:18:34,56
What was the strategy of the thirty's like what were the sort of you know that the radical movements in the at the.

198
00:18:36,16 --> 00:18:46,47
And that's i think where you land of a view that as will be that some teacher point that traveling up in the triangle

199
00:18:46,47 --> 00:18:55,99
is more divinely unconscious of the fire will these things happen. Because the other side of it i think is.

200
00:18:55,99 --> 00:19:03,88
It's important to appreciate how they do happen. I mean you know. From my experience. Nothing.

201
00:19:03,88 --> 00:19:11,81
And i'm talking here about the area of celebrations and events. The better organized.

202
00:19:12,77 --> 00:19:16,4
The more they look as either happened just by me.

203
00:19:16,4 --> 00:19:22,64
But i have never seen a substantial change in western countries at least.

204
00:19:22,64 --> 00:19:26,49
That's that's worked very well with where there hasn't been enormous planning and energy

205
00:19:26,49 --> 00:19:32,31
and talent whatever that's going into it. And i think it's probably pretty important for people to.

206
00:19:32,31 --> 00:19:33,89
You know to realise that that's the.

207
00:19:33,89 --> 00:19:39,88
That's what makes i mean that they had the vision and the spirit and whatever all important. But silo is the sort of.

208
00:19:39,88 --> 00:19:45,69
It's a metaphor for life a space so i was to getting down to the teen text of thinking how is this going to happen.

209
00:19:45,69 --> 00:19:46,74
What are the mechanics.

210
00:19:47,88 --> 00:19:54,18
It was actually quite interesting i mean in nineteen eighty story i went up and participated in a ten year reading

211
00:19:54,18 --> 00:19:56,63
and this free festival that.

212
00:19:56,63 --> 00:20:00,22
By virtue of people being me up and saying hey the teen years are up to me saying so

213
00:20:00,22 --> 00:20:05,49
and saying well what we can do about it. So he ended up and. The experience was interesting.

214
00:20:07,15 --> 00:20:15,05
I've tried to go back and repeat a little bit the pattern of saving up their waste of time and sort of.

215
00:20:15,32 --> 00:20:21,12
Announced that we were going to sort of hold festival. Creation workshop. We were going to invite anyone.

216
00:20:21,12 --> 00:20:26,66
They want to come along and talk about what this. What this anniversary fist was going to be.

217
00:20:26,66 --> 00:20:30,21
So we ensconced ourselves and bought a factory up there and sort of you know.

218
00:20:30,21 --> 00:20:34,4
I have a couple of days and lot of people hundreds of people probably came through.

219
00:20:34,4 --> 00:20:39,55
All terribly concerned to talk about whether this was going to be about environmental women or aborigines.

220
00:20:40,26 --> 00:20:43,14
And i thought all good you know when when we get all this out of the way when we're.

221
00:20:43,14 --> 00:20:44,39
You know where we've cleared the air

222
00:20:44,39 --> 00:20:51,24
when we know why we're all doing it then we can actually start the planing to my dismay was upon static feet all day

223
00:20:51,24 --> 00:20:56,57
and decided that they actually drew up a real sort of least that's going to be about these things.

224
00:20:56,57 --> 00:21:05,22
And then as far as i can step a seat. No one was left sitting there thinking oh well at the next.

225
00:21:05,22 --> 00:21:09,95
How do we know we did this year tells i had to we organize the food supply.

226
00:21:09,95 --> 00:21:20,85
All of the things that basically the two decks. Peps i take a rather price a view of it. But that was. I think we.

227
00:21:20,85 --> 00:21:27,43
One of the things that struck me from that period was that with would have produced a fairly intellectual.

228
00:21:27,43 --> 00:21:29,45
Place what generation that's.

229
00:21:29,45 --> 00:21:35,35
In since i have originated i think i'm in love with the site many of us have seen it so you know.

230
00:21:35,35 --> 00:21:40,6
Good at conceptual thinking and theorizing that we can think adelies he she is that

231
00:21:40,6 --> 00:21:50,54
when there's not a lot of real basic sort of hands on practical skilling the end perhaps and that's.

232
00:21:50,54 --> 00:21:56,61
Critique of the education system is based in and teaching people how to think conceptually.

233
00:21:56,61 --> 00:22:02,78
We probably need to be thinking celebrations we need to be thinking about teaching people how you do it.

234
00:22:02,78 --> 00:22:10,95
And i don't see a lot of a lot of that happening. I suppose these days it's hot out.

235
00:22:10,95 --> 00:22:15,05
In the period that led up to newman and when i talked about some of the things of static.

236
00:22:15,15 --> 00:22:20,52
We knew somewhat it was a bit of a simpler society of nice days i mean if you we're only nineteen

237
00:22:20,52 --> 00:22:25,72
and you only had a couple of hundred dollars to nine if you were lucky. You could actually get by the first.

238
00:22:25,72 --> 00:22:31,91
The first month's rent on the building and you could actually sort of you know. Grab a seance system drop a stage and.

239
00:22:31,91 --> 00:22:37,89
Instead of a new they stay sisters feeling that everything has become so super professional that it's old you know an

240
00:22:37,89 --> 00:22:44,3
issue got backers and finance and lawyers and you know. You can't do anything. I think that's a bit sad.

241
00:22:44,3 --> 00:22:48,97
Because i think that part of that spirit of name them was. We can do it. Spirit.

242
00:22:48,97 --> 00:23:00,64
That you know that it's not it's not irony in the hands of the entrepreneurs and. The money the money part of town.

243
00:23:00,64 --> 00:23:04,09
But if you can conceive anything strong enough you can do it and i must admit.

244
00:23:04,09 --> 00:23:08,61
When i think back to have even stepped into some of those things it was nice.

245
00:23:08,61 --> 00:23:17,79
But you carried it off as i said the bottom line is that nobody died. And perhaps.

246
00:23:17,79 --> 00:23:24,73
As we know i think what's happened is that the society is becoming increasingly specialized and.

247
00:23:25,53 --> 00:23:29,12
And increasingly professionalised. And maybe that's a good thing.

248
00:23:29,12 --> 00:23:34,43
But i think with young people i think we're probably reaching another one of those watersheds if we're not careful we

249
00:23:34,43 --> 00:23:36,21
going to go right back to way we were

250
00:23:36,21 --> 00:23:45,42
when i came in in the fifty's that things are rotten by this older generation that has all.

251
00:23:45,42 --> 00:23:47,41
All of the finance loss all of the power

252
00:23:47,41 --> 00:23:54,22
and all of the strains on a younger generation that doesn't have a lot of power over their lives and decision making

253
00:23:54,22 --> 00:24:00,49
and obviously the young people that come crashing through all that and do fantastic things but i think he's had.

254
00:24:01,24 --> 00:24:08,24
And i think it's one of the things that time. We're going to have to come to terms with and.

255
00:24:08,24 --> 00:24:15,05
Sometimes i feel that we were close twenty years ago to coming to terms with some of those things and i think we.

256
00:24:15,19 --> 00:24:19,54
All realize they in the lobby realize to be intellectually that there wasn't going to be work for everyone that we're

257
00:24:19,54 --> 00:24:24,73
going to have. Creasing have machines and computers do it. Then we're going to have to.

258
00:24:24,73 --> 00:24:32,09
Not not have to use the joy it was that we were going to arrive at a society where people work less and had malaysia.

259
00:24:32,09 --> 00:24:35,63
We haven't. Chief that we seem to arrive but the society where.

260
00:24:35,63 --> 00:24:44,88
One group of the population works harder than than is you know particularly. Desirable for people to work and the help.

261
00:24:44,88 --> 00:24:49,22
Bunch of the population is irian ited has no access to that and sits on the obama side.

262
00:24:49,54 --> 00:24:58,27
We haven't achieved the right balance and. I'm not sure way of. We have achieved the right.

263
00:24:58,27 --> 00:25:02,75
The right balance of power there. Because it does come back to power.

264
00:25:02,75 --> 00:25:06,89
And i think we've disenfranchised lots of groups in the not any they regionals way.

265
00:25:06,89 --> 00:25:11,95
And danger of decent range rising young people in society. And all sorts of other goods.

266
00:25:12,24 --> 00:25:20,39
So i think we have to grapple with those things and. I think that. I hope there's a way for us for celebrations and.

267
00:25:20,39 --> 00:25:29,92
There's a role for women i mean nimbin seems to me to have become now. By a set of ideas.

268
00:25:29,92 --> 00:25:35,23
And a mental spiritual community as much as a physical community.

269
00:25:35,23 --> 00:25:41,22
And i know lots of people that don't physically leave it in but actually say name in the name and.

270
00:25:41,22 --> 00:25:46,88
Community is of some importance to the lives. And i hope in the that time.

271
00:25:46,88 --> 00:25:50,85
Some of that exploring and radical thinking and innovating is still happening.

272
00:25:50,85 --> 00:26:07,26
Because i think we're so the things that would spit on that first decision. Twenty years ago. With this line of.

273
00:26:07,26 --> 00:26:15,05
Things. Yeah. I remember that one but.

274
00:26:17,56 --> 00:26:25,52
One sticks in my mind of for one reason as you are what you eat which i take as a very basic statement of despite all

275
00:26:25,52 --> 00:26:34,18
the intellectual reasons. I think in terms of whether i can. Munich and. Some of the insights of name and.

276
00:26:34,18 --> 00:26:34,91
In a few words.

277
00:26:35,54 --> 00:26:43,41
That's always had one of the ones that sticks in my mind as is one that robinson used to use quite a bit. Which is.

278
00:26:43,41 --> 00:26:44,44
You are what you eat.

279
00:26:44,99 --> 00:26:53,38
Which is all my very basic stipend saying despite all the fine think you need to actualise ing etc. Basically it's or.

280
00:26:53,38 --> 00:27:02,79
You can reduce it all to very simple things. And the other one. Lost my train of thought for a moment.

281
00:27:07,11 --> 00:27:15,64
There was another one the. It was interesting wasn't. One of the sort of.

282
00:27:15,64 --> 00:27:16,61
If you like slogan

283
00:27:16,61 --> 00:27:21,71
and i think they sings ass flagons because of the few words they can't be any deeper than that one one that.

284
00:27:21,71 --> 00:27:28,34
That always stayed with me was. Was one of the balinese use which is that. We have an hour.

285
00:27:28,34 --> 00:27:34,17
We seem to do everything as well as we can. And i think that was to me bit of a stipend of. The out.

286
00:27:34,17 --> 00:27:50,15
That fullness saw the atlas ness of and in the interesting musically. Musical phrases.

287
00:27:50,15 --> 00:27:57,26
Always sort of stick with the three as we know and other things faded and made a long time since i was a particular

288
00:27:57,26 --> 00:28:06,3
and as a name mandela i guess. Which you know. Certainly gave me great.

289
00:28:06,3 --> 00:28:12,01
Invigoration and energy at the time and still that's. Thank you.
