1
00:00:16,92 --> 00:00:33,94
Background they come here tough. Ok. Well. It's not that they're doing. The john guy. Will be. You double click.

2
00:00:38,88 --> 00:01:00,03
Are you. Ve r a s d e c k. Yeah. But. Fifty. And for the last ten years.

3
00:01:00,03 --> 00:01:12,93
I've been deeply involved in developing a new model for the occupancy of. Will lead. You to a village called.

4
00:01:12,93 --> 00:01:25,4
The include. Which we're very happy to call the solar unit. And the name is peter berg.

5
00:01:27,33 --> 00:01:33,31
Been in a triad twenty years now. Cocky aquarian spirit in california.

6
00:01:33,31 --> 00:01:43,36
We find it through furder study and enjoyment into pacific and. Got here around fourteen years ago and help.

7
00:01:43,36 --> 00:01:59,13
Create live in a combine click here will get you to. The. Nearly nine hundred acres and with thirty five k. Northwest.

8
00:01:59,13 --> 00:02:11,17
A business. Bill and cliffs. Is a privately owned strata title village. On nine hundred eighty.

9
00:02:12,33 --> 00:02:30,3
Thirty five northwest of lism all of its physical shape is three. Descending. Values. Of about three hundred acres.

10
00:02:30,47 --> 00:02:42,52
He these represent. Three main parts of the village. You have the north end which is very very secluded.

11
00:02:42,52 --> 00:02:45,39
And alive with wildlife.

12
00:02:45,39 --> 00:02:49,91
You have to send a valley where most of the activity goes on

13
00:02:49,91 --> 00:03:00,01
and we have the south end which is a very highly developed and. Organic the.

14
00:03:00,01 --> 00:03:07,95
It's within these three that liza lay within another sort of value so. From wherever you are situated.

15
00:03:07,95 --> 00:03:19,57
The eclipse is a magnificent view of the actual cliff and dylan. We live in a valley that is bounded on one side.

16
00:03:19,57 --> 00:03:25,83
By a flat topped cliff. Ever the timbered. Had on the other side.

17
00:03:25,83 --> 00:03:35,22
Rolling out in the lane and he too we have mccullough rages are getting steeper and he's good and. Oh.

18
00:03:38,03 --> 00:03:44,91
Yeah the village would have around. Eighty different homes or structures. Of make maybe.

19
00:03:44,91 --> 00:03:54,14
Seventy would be occupied and turned in fifteen locks. And all the certainly in setting it up.

20
00:03:54,14 --> 00:03:59,89
Took up a balance between the requirements of nature of human requirements and economic requirements

21
00:03:59,89 --> 00:04:06,56
and we made a formula. Thirty thirty thirty huge you'd have a third of the property is under private control.

22
00:04:06,56 --> 00:04:13,27
For your own gardens and home. About a third of it is controlled with your name. It works for you for affection or.

23
00:04:13,27 --> 00:04:19,28
For some economic activity like. Orchard and the third is set aside as a wildlife area.

24
00:04:19,28 --> 00:04:29,28
Specifically to get created back in the quality that can go. Yellow.

25
00:04:29,5 --> 00:04:37,05
This is where we differ from most other communities. There is no. Philosophical or religious or political.

26
00:04:37,05 --> 00:04:47,86
Kind of ties here this was a village that was designed by a visionary guy from nimbin terry mcgee.

27
00:04:47,86 --> 00:05:00,16
It was put together by. The legal side of things were put together by. Tony to got a little more so this time.

28
00:05:00,16 --> 00:05:10,91
And it was put together as a multiple occupancy based on the draft of the malta talk you can see the did come out a few

29
00:05:10,91 --> 00:05:21,89
years before all and that allowed. A certain portion of the land to be our and.

30
00:05:21,89 --> 00:05:32,08
Individually with and the rest held in common. And will. Will come back to this later on. However that.

31
00:05:32,08 --> 00:05:39,64
The way it was put together. And the very word god.

32
00:05:40,68 --> 00:05:48,22
We had experienced an awful lot of trouble with council settling it it seemed to be the state government saying yes you

33
00:05:48,22 --> 00:05:50,13
can do things like this.

34
00:05:50,13 --> 00:05:51,79
And the council saying well you can do it

35
00:05:51,79 --> 00:06:01,04
but not really in our backyard it out back out even though that given the development. Proveable had been given and.

36
00:06:01,04 --> 00:06:10,43
Everything was being done out of that pita talk of wow. What about that side of the problems with council.

37
00:06:10,43 --> 00:06:17,11
That virtually. A classic response. Could be study. There will always be a sign.

38
00:06:17,93 --> 00:06:22,39
We were encouraged in the hills by by state government.

39
00:06:22,39 --> 00:06:25,24
We were trying to be pushed out of the hills by local government

40
00:06:25,24 --> 00:06:30,71
and federal government paid for it all for the whole mess. It's cost the government a lot of money.

41
00:06:30,71 --> 00:06:37,26
And it is at best sickly it's a reflection of a lack of integration on the level of government.

42
00:06:37,26 --> 00:06:42,93
And that is state government saw the need for people to settle in the hills to change.

43
00:06:42,93 --> 00:06:47,2
Clapped out farms into organic paradises to change been employed hughes.

44
00:06:47,2 --> 00:06:53,6
And to people who built their own homes and their own assets. And local government.

45
00:06:53,6 --> 00:07:03,87
Didn't want to do this on one fact but they did it. I assume this. Meant a different look.

46
00:07:03,87 --> 00:07:15,17
When we did receive the approval. The mayor died shortly. In that period. And in between. Day to day.

47
00:07:15,17 --> 00:07:20,19
Final lodging of yep a bureaucracy put a request for a one

48
00:07:20,19 --> 00:07:26,62
and twenty year bridge which was going to cost something like five million dollars. And then said.

49
00:07:26,62 --> 00:07:28,76
No one can move on an established.

50
00:07:28,76 --> 00:07:34,26
Is build and so they put as a muti outside the law we were illegal occupants of the land.

51
00:07:34,26 --> 00:07:44,17
By by design by local council and from there on it went on to parade or a shared raid really. Off. Of needling and.

52
00:07:44,17 --> 00:07:53,43
Plastering that. Beggars description. From having to put every tree on the property onto a map and to what slocum.

53
00:07:53,43 --> 00:07:57,95
Would stand on what size it would be and fire hydrants every two meters.

54
00:07:58,2 --> 00:08:05,82
It was a it was a mad house day maid put twenty five thousand dollars in engineering reports on bits of land that

55
00:08:05,82 --> 00:08:13,84
really need any and when i look back on those days. The only thing i find in. Credible and. Hard to believe.

56
00:08:13,84 --> 00:08:21,49
Is that so many of us stuck it out. Out of the very first twenty people who landed here we still have fifteen of them.

57
00:08:21,49 --> 00:08:32,39
And three of the others come back regularly wishing they hadn't holed up. So it. It did two things for us.

58
00:08:32,39 --> 00:08:47,22
It taught us how to handle bureaucracy. It taught us that sometimes confrontation. Is necessary but.

59
00:08:47,22 --> 00:08:55,48
More than anything else. Well it is together. As a group of people.

60
00:08:55,48 --> 00:08:58,38
Because we all come from different walks of our lives

61
00:08:58,38 --> 00:09:05,71
and peter had come from brisbane i'd come from rocky other people. Many people had never been on the line and.

62
00:09:05,71 --> 00:09:10,09
We were here we. Because we were illegal we couldn't make the rug.

63
00:09:11,91 --> 00:09:19,3
People were travelling up and down hills carrying buckets of water i mean it was quite frightening.

64
00:09:19,64 --> 00:09:22,61
And finally i suppose we.

65
00:09:22,61 --> 00:09:29,74
We started to feel our sin and we started doing a bit of ogling and doing a bit of construction

66
00:09:29,74 --> 00:09:36,48
and we brought things to a head. We've had would be ten years of problems with.

67
00:09:36,48 --> 00:09:45,24
With local government it was only really a couple of the individual within the bureaucracy of the lose more council.

68
00:09:45,24 --> 00:09:54,45
We brought things to such a head at one stage in the guy that threatened to take us into coal. And we said.

69
00:09:54,45 --> 00:10:02,57
Take it with nazi. Because we publicly defying. Him. But we didn't we just told the truth about.

70
00:10:02,57 --> 00:10:05,55
At that time we were called. Feral humans.

71
00:10:05,55 --> 00:10:11,17
And that's the name of court and i know that i work with indigo rocker so yet that kano and then we had a feral humans.

72
00:10:12,03 --> 00:10:16,53
And the whole notion of a fourth level of government. Which we were here.

73
00:10:16,53 --> 00:10:22,52
We want to empower ourselves to make the decisions about our wildlife area about our roads.

74
00:10:22,52 --> 00:10:28,07
And not keep each and every decision old local government. So that whole process was alien to him. D.

75
00:10:28,07 --> 00:10:36,19
Everett bureaucrats thought that was promised it would come in if the bridge to us. It wasn't good and to us.

76
00:10:36,19 --> 00:10:38,78
It always was the essence.

77
00:10:38,78 --> 00:10:45,5
You while you might you must make a new system which both capitalism and communism in it into a new marriage.

78
00:10:45,5 --> 00:10:54,39
Are i myself. I'm a green economist. And i get very upset if i say divide and rule. Ethics that is being done by.

79
00:10:54,39 --> 00:11:00,55
Us which says you're either a commie or you're a capitalist. Rose as a matter of fact we had d.c. Urges ourselves.

80
00:11:00,55 --> 00:11:04,96
When it comes to making a stand on our car our land. You believe.

81
00:11:04,96 --> 00:11:08,3
You have your individual rights you preserved all if you are a capitalist.

82
00:11:08,3 --> 00:11:13,75
When it comes to the point that you need a ride from a neighbor. So when you become a communist you know.

83
00:11:13,75 --> 00:11:23,05
We've got a bit of both. And i can well see from the eyes you did the rock was a debt time. Debt. A group of people.

84
00:11:23,05 --> 00:11:32,93
Settling land. Odd days. A big group. A big group of people yes. Creating a an independent and but only control.

85
00:11:32,93 --> 00:11:36,42
Village was frightening. I must try to. Yeah. I can i can see that.

86
00:11:36,42 --> 00:11:40,35
While they were thinking they're going to be hordes of them. Yeah. You know what i did worry.

87
00:11:40,35 --> 00:11:42,92
We thought we were one of the first of many.

88
00:11:42,92 --> 00:11:47,83
There was real fears of the time that it was going to be a swing in the electorate.

89
00:11:47,83 --> 00:11:52,18
Because all of these new settlers being politically on the other spectrum or something like that infected

90
00:11:52,18 --> 00:11:53,96
and that actually happened.

91
00:11:53,96 --> 00:12:00,11
Deland to release policy of councils today is based on bringing it up to the land to bring stability desirable people

92
00:12:00,11 --> 00:12:06,25
and it's never stated lived it is just a fact of life and it's not corruption that's just how things work.

93
00:12:06,25 --> 00:12:10,93
Yet our western system we point out as you're saying that if your nuclear weapons don't look at each system at their

94
00:12:10,93 --> 00:12:19,73
own. In bill. Let's get on. What it is. Ok we're talking about now i suppose nine hundred eighty two.

95
00:12:19,73 --> 00:12:26,26
We got our proveable in september. Some people moved on straight away.

96
00:12:26,26 --> 00:12:34,28
I didn't actually move on until october eighty three years because i felt the place was falling to pieces.

97
00:12:34,28 --> 00:12:43,8
Nothing was happening. So i came here and started to build my house. And within a month. Three other houses.

98
00:12:43,8 --> 00:12:50,91
Were going up up until that time no one was doing. Council came around and stuck these things on our notice.

99
00:12:50,91 --> 00:12:58,17
On our door stop working mediately and all this bullshit. And in fact i came up here once.

100
00:12:58,17 --> 00:13:02,27
And he stood here for about fifteen minutes and we were all working away and.

101
00:13:02,27 --> 00:13:05,68
No one took the blind bit of notice i and finally called out to me

102
00:13:05,68 --> 00:13:10,89
and he said you've got to stop this work i said yes my friend. When the roof is on.

103
00:13:10,89 --> 00:13:17,4
And we've moved in and it's finished. Our stuff. And he got the same kind of response elsewhere.

104
00:13:17,58 --> 00:13:21,58
It came to a head and they'd agreed deign to do.

105
00:13:21,58 --> 00:13:28,86
What the agreement had always been that we could be a bit of a staged development. We get this. We do that.

106
00:13:28,86 --> 00:13:38,75
We get that. We do that. We had seventeen conditions here. I should explain to them and here you know. Demotivation.

107
00:13:38,75 --> 00:13:41,35
In the minds of the principals.

108
00:13:41,35 --> 00:13:52,68
Was to to create a model that can be used by those millions of unfortunate that are without work or without vision.

109
00:13:53,18 --> 00:14:01,85
We're living in a country. And a system worldwide. That still play first. Pesticides and truck farming.

110
00:14:01,85 --> 00:14:05,66
And it has depopulated to rule population. From.

111
00:14:05,66 --> 00:14:11,17
You know like twenty percent of your farmers to where it is now like of only a few percent. And those people have.

112
00:14:11,29 --> 00:14:15,06
An essence going to the city and. Our pool of unemployed.

113
00:14:15,06 --> 00:14:19,19
And we're trying to reverse that and saying you've got to go into organic farming.

114
00:14:19,52 --> 00:14:23,2
You've got to go into high labor intensity we must start making labor.

115
00:14:23,2 --> 00:14:29,71
Lovely again and gardening is healthy our garden is good for you. So we were always in that mode of mind.

116
00:14:29,71 --> 00:14:38,47
We had to provide something that can be used easily and i think ultimately that's the fight that was on the height.

117
00:14:38,47 --> 00:14:42,85
Behind the scenes is that the establishment.

118
00:14:42,85 --> 00:14:51,18
For whatever reason was not ready to embrace a model that now is so sorely needed.

119
00:14:51,18 --> 00:14:52,73
Because how do you settle people on the land.

120
00:14:53,3 --> 00:14:58,71
It didn't work as a multiple occupancy because the moment to emma was created. The right to withdrawn from it.

121
00:14:58,8 --> 00:15:03,94
You couldn't get a telephone you couldn't get a fourth homeowners grant you were you were a non-citizen.

122
00:15:03,94 --> 00:15:09,89
In fact you could be sprayed on. By the air because you were only one farm. Not five thousand people didn't exist.

123
00:15:10,07 --> 00:15:15,21
Ok we became ruled accidental. We would be well maybe we should just talk a little bit more about that.

124
00:15:15,54 --> 00:15:16,69
And what actually happened.

125
00:15:17,36 --> 00:15:18,72
We've been having all of this trouble

126
00:15:18,72 --> 00:15:26,19
and we had agreed on their stage development they would give us ten building permits for people who were living in bad

127
00:15:26,19 --> 00:15:30,92
conditions here. If we did this. Much of the free.

128
00:15:31,83 --> 00:15:36,34
We did that they gave us a few more did this they gave it so that way that went through.

129
00:15:37,28 --> 00:15:46,46
But as we were coming towards the end of that. One day the planner of the day a guy called peter ryan does.

130
00:15:46,46 --> 00:15:48,31
Send us a letter.

131
00:15:48,31 --> 00:15:55,05
And this supposed to be the eighty four eighty five when the moated block conceicao that actually came out.

132
00:15:55,05 --> 00:16:02,59
And when it came out due to influences from dominant and. They were saying this is all wrong. It shouldn't be.

133
00:16:02,59 --> 00:16:09,86
All the lane should be held in common like you know we can all sit here and. Think about buddha together every night.

134
00:16:09,86 --> 00:16:16,05
So they actually. After up to multiple occupancy cars. And i'm not blaming them.

135
00:16:16,05 --> 00:16:19,65
They just did what they thought was the right thing. But that my.

136
00:16:19,65 --> 00:16:26,04
We got a letter from this planner saying within the terms of the clock you can seek out you are an illegal subdivision

137
00:16:26,04 --> 00:16:29,02
because we had our own internal.

138
00:16:29,02 --> 00:16:35,97
Certificate for our two i was and he said i would suggest you stay your certificates up and forget about the boundary.

139
00:16:37,88 --> 00:16:42,3
So that you just got right up mine a is for a kickoff.

140
00:16:43,23 --> 00:16:50,82
And there was no leadership at that moment one leadership group had collapse over the failure of the development plane

141
00:16:50,82 --> 00:16:55,68
which was to finish the route. If it didn't get finished.

142
00:16:55,68 --> 00:17:00,92
And that development group fell to pieces but some of those people. Popped forward and.

143
00:17:00,92 --> 00:17:09,46
I got involved and we created what we called a legality. And we started with a massive. Letter writing campaign to.

144
00:17:09,46 --> 00:17:16,08
Every bureaucrat and every politician. In federal and state spheres and.

145
00:17:16,08 --> 00:17:22,26
Writing the most heart rending letters about our situation here would put our lives in which we had.

146
00:17:22,26 --> 00:17:29,00
It was all the truth and now after four years. We're told we are an illegal a subdivision.

147
00:17:29,64 --> 00:17:36,43
So it came to a head actually the day before the labor government got kicked out in new south wales one of the last at

148
00:17:36,43 --> 00:17:43,75
bob carr did as environmentalists minister. Was signed a document. Converting this lane.

149
00:17:43,75 --> 00:17:46,15
From rural to rural residential.

150
00:17:46,15 --> 00:17:53,48
And he threw it right back into the lap of the lismore city council said right we've ruled.

151
00:17:53,48 --> 00:18:00,59
We've rezoned a lane that now you issue them with some sort of title. So we ended up with the strata title.

152
00:18:00,59 --> 00:18:10,1
It's not the best way of doing our community and it's been it's been a very very expensive for us. But as i say.

153
00:18:10,1 --> 00:18:11,17
We've had a of.

154
00:18:11,27 --> 00:18:14,69
The strong core group here right from the word go out

155
00:18:14,69 --> 00:18:23,75
and eighty five percent of the people who have come in since then have. Kind of joined that vision.

156
00:18:24,45 --> 00:18:31,27
So we've been extremely lucky we had a few dissenters every community does this everywhere in the world.

157
00:18:31,27 --> 00:18:33,55
But we have very few.

158
00:18:33,55 --> 00:18:42,94
And we've just taken a further step forward now by getting this government money and undertaking certain things. So.

159
00:18:42,94 --> 00:18:46,04
It was destroying that that core group and it was the first four

160
00:18:46,04 --> 00:18:53,76
or five years with all its problems we had to put in i write very early in the piece. Before anything else.

161
00:18:53,76 --> 00:19:01,27
Some neighbors around here and some who live nowhere near here. On public money. Through legal aid.

162
00:19:01,27 --> 00:19:06,52
Took the lismore city to count to call to say that.

163
00:19:06,52 --> 00:19:10,51
This shouldn't be allowed to happen or use a piece of shit in the creek.

164
00:19:10,51 --> 00:19:12,21
Led by a guy who works for the pound

165
00:19:12,21 --> 00:19:19,04
or so security who has very scared of having so security recipients moving next to his farm. Yes.

166
00:19:19,53 --> 00:19:26,82
It went down to the environment of coal land then diamond. Gold and diamond jim was a judge.

167
00:19:27,82 --> 00:19:32,99
And after about three nine months or something he finally got the shits didn't he just said look.

168
00:19:32,99 --> 00:19:37,53
He said bring this case to again tomorrow he said i'm sick of it. But almost everyone agrees.

169
00:19:37,53 --> 00:19:43,1
Yeah it almost killed and nearly killed us. Yeah. Nearly killed us and they did it all on legal aid.

170
00:19:43,1 --> 00:19:49,64
Cost us forty five grain. Eighty the for.

171
00:19:49,64 --> 00:19:54,05
Nine hundred eighty four and i eighty eighty three eighty three eighty three eighty three dollars

172
00:19:54,05 --> 00:20:00,24
and eighty two at the beginning of the year. And now we've got our approval in september.

173
00:20:00,24 --> 00:20:04,68
One final approval in september eighty two this was in january of eighty three.

174
00:20:04,68 --> 00:20:11,17
And this was the first thing we had to encounter. However as i say that the.

175
00:20:11,32 --> 00:20:16,09
About ten people involved at that time to build a group. Yes a little bit wrong girt a caucus.

176
00:20:16,93 --> 00:20:23,49
So the adversity was good. Tells the. Attorney about how i was living.

177
00:20:26,01 --> 00:20:33,78
I've been where i was where i'd come down from rocky. But nothing was happening here. So i had a job. To do in lismore.

178
00:20:33,78 --> 00:20:40,99
And i was living in the northern and i come over every weekend and come up to the board meetings and stuff and.

179
00:20:40,99 --> 00:20:54,34
I could sense. Nothing was happening. And i we knew by then the court case was on i went down as a witness and.

180
00:20:54,34 --> 00:21:00,77
I said to my wife could you stand living in a tent. Bearing in mind that she was fifty three years of age you know.

181
00:21:02,5 --> 00:21:13,43
We bought a maki tent which we still use at bill and cliff's functions and things. That was out there where my car is.

182
00:21:13,43 --> 00:21:21,43
And i our son jason and he friend richard and our daughters ali. Lived in that town. We had hot food.

183
00:21:21,43 --> 00:21:30,49
And we had a fridge in there. He went to school looking clean every day she used to buy.

184
00:21:30,49 --> 00:21:39,03
It with just about got ready to have our roof up. And i had a drunken. Accident. In my motor car.

185
00:21:39,03 --> 00:21:50,68
I told my mother and it was a big beautiful. Toy out a land cruiser i'd always intended to sell it to finish.

186
00:21:50,68 --> 00:21:57,52
The house but it took me about three months or four months. To get the money together to get the repairs done.

187
00:21:57,52 --> 00:22:04,79
So that i could sell it. Yeah it took us ten months.

188
00:22:04,79 --> 00:22:11,17
And in ten months we had this loft up here was ready to move there were no wall. Just the roof on the wall.

189
00:22:11,46 --> 00:22:16,95
We had a big tent under here. And my young daughter had a little tent.

190
00:22:16,95 --> 00:22:24,04
Over here and we used to sleep up in the last name we got that one down and gradually. Well two years.

191
00:22:24,62 --> 00:22:33,96
Basically we had a basic house we just improved a little bit. It's. Our just moving in from.

192
00:22:33,96 --> 00:22:38,72
Exiting executive post in britain and up in a nice apartment

193
00:22:38,72 --> 00:22:44,41
and i really wanted to get away from anything to do with civilization so i walked in buckets for years

194
00:22:44,41 --> 00:22:52,14
and was more interested in sitting in the rain and sitting inside. I'm still building my house after ten years.

195
00:22:52,99 --> 00:23:01,76
Getting there slowly. But you've done a lot of other things out there. I put my total time. That's a difference.

196
00:23:01,76 --> 00:23:11,12
Carry on their world. The thing is to. How could you do it and i do. I think you've got to have a certain.

197
00:23:11,12 --> 00:23:17,19
Philosophical foundation. To do it must either be a grassroots. Worshipper that wants to you know.

198
00:23:17,19 --> 00:23:24,85
Improve nature or have some thoughts compassion to actually do it. And i believe now that. Land should be settled.

199
00:23:24,85 --> 00:23:31,03
Not like i did it. I don't think it is for public consumption i think it's not many people can do it.

200
00:23:31,03 --> 00:23:34,97
In fact that's one of many people are doing it.

201
00:23:34,97 --> 00:23:42,35
Is beautiful and it certainly made me that the country more than i ever could. You know stepping away from that.

202
00:23:42,35 --> 00:23:47,88
Cage of civilization out there amongst the ticks and the mosquitoes and. And the snakes.

203
00:23:47,88 --> 00:23:56,86
But nowadays i favor a mode where you have a little cabin to start with and walk on from there. But. Death work.

204
00:23:56,86 --> 00:24:07,04
Can be accessed by. Less adventurous. Thought. There was a.

205
00:24:07,04 --> 00:24:14,84
There were several different philosophies i think operating at the time. I don't think any of us are really aware.

206
00:24:14,84 --> 00:24:19,98
What all the flush of these were prevalent in people's minds we sort of assumed they were all that the simon they

207
00:24:19,98 --> 00:24:26,14
weren't. There was a very strong group of people who were just want to build a beautiful organic garden.

208
00:24:26,14 --> 00:24:30,08
And avoid people who are into.

209
00:24:30,08 --> 00:24:35,89
Celebrating the low cost of the land and building their own home the home builders and date don't think lifestyle.

210
00:24:35,89 --> 00:24:51,75
The home builders end up with a nice home and. Rudimentary gardens and the garden and have mostly..

211
00:24:41,18 --> 00:24:53,08
Beautiful gardens and. Smaller cabins. There also was a sufficient. Large group of people who were d. If you wish the.

212
00:24:53,08 --> 00:24:59,98
Outcasts. Of a modern society who ran into trouble. Emotionally mentally or financially.

213
00:24:59,98 --> 00:25:06,75
In that big thing called the system and. Came to push for refuge. Very much.

214
00:25:06,75 --> 00:25:11,46
Still a part of our life dollars to act you have compassion for those people.

215
00:25:13,74 --> 00:25:18,94
Nevertheless that creates problems of its own because you have to start thinking for people are dead after what i've

216
00:25:18,94 --> 00:25:21,65
been projecting much a salutation at a mic and part of it.

217
00:25:22,51 --> 00:25:28,64
So one of the things of what's the most important to me i find myself.

218
00:25:28,64 --> 00:25:35,95
Shifting from a very well paid and satisfactory position. In government.

219
00:25:35,95 --> 00:25:42,67
To a non-paid position which a very proud and happy with actually transforming the world in a little way.

220
00:25:42,67 --> 00:25:47,36
In time making a contribution to something. Yeah i think that.

221
00:25:47,36 --> 00:25:56,18
Main battle that we have now in is trying to make authorities reassess the meaning of what.

222
00:25:56,18 --> 00:26:05,43
You see and we have been successful in a couple of minor ways already we. We have made various groups understand.

223
00:26:06,55 --> 00:26:11,17
The already the day to day judge work. If you get paid by. That you know.

224
00:26:11,3 --> 00:26:16,65
There's a lot of work done which people don't get paid but we do a lot of work here voluntarily.

225
00:26:16,65 --> 00:26:21,4
We maintain our roads and all that and.

226
00:26:21,4 --> 00:26:29,93
So yeah that's what we're working on now is trying to get a reassessment of the meaning of what i like to say something

227
00:26:29,93 --> 00:26:32,14
there. At the time that we are starting.

228
00:26:32,14 --> 00:26:38,97
Maybe a year or two after another development tried its way here called mebane springs and they were very orderly.

229
00:26:38,97 --> 00:26:41,88
Very ordered. They were calling for cochran and the corporate plumber.

230
00:26:41,88 --> 00:26:45,61
They were really trying to structure a model society.

231
00:26:45,84 --> 00:26:52,57
Whereas we didn't have no such choice we just took anybody who wanted to come it affect. Memon springs.

232
00:26:52,57 --> 00:26:59,37
Failed because of all the organisation where we succeeded because in the end. I became to be plentiful his village.

233
00:26:59,71 --> 00:27:04,34
John became the trainer for the village. The or the grower can you're going to grow over the village to.

234
00:27:04,34 --> 00:27:09,46
That machine then became the road builder for the village. And strange enough.

235
00:27:09,46 --> 00:27:16,83
In a lot of people who thought they had a skill in one way. In fact coming to live via. Has developed a skill.

236
00:27:16,83 --> 00:27:26,71
It another way we have issues by. Who really wants to be a bad guy but he make shoes and you like beautiful shoes.

237
00:27:26,71 --> 00:27:28,75
And i did it all sorry.

238
00:27:28,75 --> 00:27:34,78
Just i just make a thrift is known and i realized we were different from the other communities in a way.

239
00:27:34,78 --> 00:27:39,74
Is now coming to fruition in a true sense not just legally because of the documentation.

240
00:27:39,74 --> 00:27:43,1
But because we learned to get a so much.

241
00:27:43,1 --> 00:27:48,55
Over this period and found solace from for the strength and we acted like a company more and more.

242
00:27:48,55 --> 00:27:56,02
Finally we could sit down amongst ourselves and saying what the hell is going on. Why are all of a sitting here.

243
00:27:56,02 --> 00:28:03,85
Be basically kept in poverty by the lack of work being available here.

244
00:28:03,85 --> 00:28:11,17
We are positioned in a place here on the one of the gala that we took stock of our skills from society.

245
00:28:11,83 --> 00:28:17,75
And those skills we developed ourselves in the interim. Like mud brick building and let glassing and.

246
00:28:17,75 --> 00:28:24,97
Sense of the cement from the saddam bush walking and building all these things. And we put it together.

247
00:28:24,97 --> 00:28:31,69
And we looked at our place. And we thought look we are living here. On a national park.

248
00:28:31,69 --> 00:28:41,99
Quality bit of land that we ourselves are rehabilitating into the world heritage reserve huish. We've got structure.

249
00:28:41,99 --> 00:28:49,5
To become teachers of this skill. And we've got the skills and we built the teaching around our common skills.

250
00:28:49,5 --> 00:28:53,46
And with that taking stock of a village which i think is unique in astray a battery.

251
00:28:54,00 --> 00:29:02,84
This fourth level government looking at itself and saying what can we do. To solve problems. And here clouds. Are now.

252
00:29:02,84 --> 00:29:06,62
Not getting into the commercial development stage we're talking talk about.

253
00:29:06,62 --> 00:29:13,08
Common growing worked on to do this just that whole which is happening here. In the good alternative.

254
00:29:13,08 --> 00:29:20,69
Of booting programs on right now. By the end of next year we will have completed by the middle of this.

255
00:29:20,69 --> 00:29:23,44
Coming ninety three in one year we will have completed.

256
00:29:23,44 --> 00:29:30,65
Two major buildings i don't know if you saw the one wrapped up in black light. That's going to be the most magnificent.

257
00:29:30,65 --> 00:29:46,52
To building on three levels. And our other building is quite magnificent. And that's all done on voluntary light but.

258
00:29:46,52 --> 00:30:08,66
People do work. You know. Well fur's been a major part of the locals could not a building cleaved sorry. Ok. Without.

259
00:30:08,66 --> 00:30:18,89
We don't i don't consider world. World. So i'm still of the old school i believe that social security.

260
00:30:18,89 --> 00:30:23,77
We have about a third of the people here who have there are in money.

261
00:30:23,77 --> 00:30:33,55
From one source or another about a third of our people are on some sort of pension and.

262
00:30:33,55 --> 00:30:40,41
We have about a third of the people unemployed. That has been the way. This was designed.

263
00:30:40,41 --> 00:30:49,3
This village was designed for income earners. To come here and go down.

264
00:30:49,3 --> 00:30:59,82
And that was based on the fact that they were on the dollar and i could get a grant. And things like. Now.

265
00:30:59,82 --> 00:31:06,58
We've got now where it's about that because we have a hundred fifteen families living in this valley that couldn't

266
00:31:06,58 --> 00:31:21,86
maintain one hundred three hundred cows. Out of those people. The ones that are here now. Virtually becoming.

267
00:31:21,86 --> 00:31:31,76
They're on the verge of wanting to earn a craft something that. One of the reasons why there was so security dependent.
