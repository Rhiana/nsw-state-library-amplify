1
00:00:22,82 --> 00:00:32,06
The upside to working in the main news. Well. I think each of us gets a certain amount of q. Docs.

2
00:00:32,06 --> 00:00:42,83
For being involved name in news. Can something we can talk about without the paypal is and doesn't involve.

3
00:00:42,83 --> 00:00:51,61
Somebody else's life or somebody has got to or. You know the usual gossip.

4
00:00:51,61 --> 00:00:54,18
Getting chasing because there's nothing else to talk about.

5
00:00:54,18 --> 00:00:59,78
But yeah something interesting to talk about is always something happening in these.

6
00:00:59,78 --> 00:01:07,22
And we would develop you know ideas and and skills and. All the rest of it.

7
00:01:07,63 --> 00:01:17,01
And the name and uses the how people really do support it in. It's not really that hard to sell the advertising and.

8
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:29,88
All that we are the cheapest around that it's still the cheapest yeah for sure. Yeah. Well you know much.

9
00:01:30,59 --> 00:01:46,92
We know and people. You know it's really good. You know it's the best one yet.

10
00:01:52,12 --> 00:01:57,69
Well they've traded it lockets in order to say which a surprise easy know why.

11
00:01:57,69 --> 00:02:05,25
It is an odd price it's very different from anyone else's. It's got some many good points to it.

12
00:02:05,25 --> 00:02:12,87
And it's good it's bad points too you know i mean people are people they're going to be nasty sometimes.

13
00:02:12,87 --> 00:02:15,94
But there's so many good things happening here that.

14
00:02:16,42 --> 00:02:26,16
He's a very interesting place to be i suppose it's especially working from this office. It's infinitely interesting.

15
00:02:30,03 --> 00:02:49,25
How often doing it. Between night knowing nice. In the main. Well there's not a place like is there. I really believed.

16
00:02:49,25 --> 00:02:54,61
The ideals that was just batted. About it.

17
00:02:54,61 --> 00:03:03,15
You know the peace love and brown grass and came back tonight sure than what i saw as the things that is.

18
00:03:03,15 --> 00:03:12,41
Simplistic why of. Saying name been has changed for me it's not the same anymore.

19
00:03:12,41 --> 00:03:16,87
There's certain amount of disillusionment. As far as the human nature part of it is concerned but.

20
00:03:19,79 --> 00:03:26,09
That's more to do is my expectations dain anything to do i mean.

21
00:03:26,09 --> 00:03:32,81
Human beings have been human beings for how long i should have got the message by now. And i have. You know i mean.

22
00:03:32,81 --> 00:03:40,63
But then i hadn't. And i sort of. Thought he was going to be. How i thought it was going to pay. But it was how it is.

23
00:03:40,63 --> 00:04:02,68
You know i mean. It was it was. Why i was there and. That's what you know that's right. When im been. Nimbin is.

24
00:04:02,68 --> 00:04:10,22
Chinese. With they all the stresses and strains and. Experiences that naman is had. You can only really pay.

25
00:04:10,22 --> 00:04:19,92
How it's evolved. And it's evolved into what it is now. So we had to. See what it is now that.

26
00:04:19,92 --> 00:04:29,93
Just walking around town and saying i saw it. It would hand shape. You know lots of people us a people smiling.

27
00:04:29,93 --> 00:04:39,19
You realize that. Yeah. Ok we've all got the docs eyes on the downsides of lofted on the how you know.

28
00:04:39,19 --> 00:05:01,69
Quite a heavy price. And it's. What you know make a lot of companies pay for anybody else.

29
00:05:01,69 --> 00:05:13,03
I mean i they don't take much notice but. I think people always pick on what i don't understand and.

30
00:05:13,03 --> 00:05:16,48
Whatever new going oh you're trying to put out over.

31
00:05:16,48 --> 00:05:24,71
When you sing eternity if he's going to be attacked from all sides because he switches in the given order. Whatever's.

32
00:05:24,71 --> 00:05:32,74
Existing for everybody else out there he says all i know. And. If you china have something a little bit different.

33
00:05:32,74 --> 00:05:39,25
But it's not that much different. Then. It's going to be attacked.

34
00:05:39,25 --> 00:05:47,37
It's going to be brought down it's going to be misrepresented. It's going to be laughed at skin of a school and.

35
00:05:47,37 --> 00:05:48,38
So i sings.

36
00:05:49,04 --> 00:05:54,7
It's other people's reactions to naming it's not really anything to do with naming that

37
00:05:54,7 --> 00:06:15,94
and say it was different because i just. Moved out of a marriage. So it was going to be different anyway.

38
00:06:16,06 --> 00:06:24,09
It was very different. I had to try and i have a cow. Living around.

39
00:06:24,09 --> 00:06:34,18
I mean a lot and really and i own a loan and know having next one i have use. So much and stuff like that.

40
00:06:34,18 --> 00:06:48,32
And i decided i count. I think libyans are very social beings i knock a little bit a balance and balance is one.

41
00:06:48,32 --> 00:07:02,7
I don't think maybe that's something i still want to learn but it hasn't. I haven't accomplished it yet. So.

42
00:07:02,7 --> 00:07:12,93
Yeah yeah yeah so life in. Only difficulties was really. I mean. I just i think i wasn't so tall at that stage.

43
00:07:12,93 --> 00:07:22,03
All the difficulties were pounced on with glee. If you like the the. The tics and late she's ha ha ha you know.

44
00:07:22,03 --> 00:07:27,49
Yeah it's a tic i have. You know you sort of. Think it's a big guy there.

45
00:07:28,85 --> 00:07:43,5
And this just shows how how you roughing it and. You know all that all that sort of stuff. Now the tics and you since.

46
00:07:43,5 --> 00:07:49,87
It was oh yeah. Well it was for me i can't speak for anybody else i mean.

47
00:07:49,87 --> 00:08:15,94
Maybe other people that i had different expectations and ideas that i went to stop this from yeah. Ok so you know..

48
00:08:04,27 --> 00:08:23,89
So it's just one t. Yeah. Yeah i'm glad to see it and i came to the area.

49
00:08:23,89 --> 00:08:34,16
A month after the aquarius festival came to me in. And i lived around noon been in many places for three years. And.

50
00:08:34,16 --> 00:08:42,34
And then became body found. Pygame part of body found when it started when we moved here nine hundred seventy seven.

51
00:08:43,13 --> 00:08:49,79
And the reason that we got this place was because of the meditation center.

52
00:08:49,79 --> 00:08:57,25
Up the road which many of us had helped to build and found and we wanted very much to be close to that.

53
00:08:57,25 --> 00:09:05,41
At that time we felt that. Meditation practice was a really important part of all of our lives.

54
00:09:05,41 --> 00:09:19,77
And yet we wanted to raise families and so on so we thought we'd have a sort of like. Community. Yeah yeah. Yes.

55
00:09:21,17 --> 00:09:28,48
Well many of us had lived in india travelled in the east.

56
00:09:28,48 --> 00:09:33,84
Some of the people who formed this community had virtually come directly from india.

57
00:09:33,84 --> 00:09:41,17
And in fact came to the area because christopher to miss. Who gave the first retreated the meditation.

58
00:09:41,17 --> 00:09:48,75
And that was really their main interest. You know lives at that time. When the very most important thing. So.

59
00:09:49,26 --> 00:09:53,31
We'd all had a lot of experience in but his practice and.

60
00:09:53,31 --> 00:10:05,66
Just wanted to share that in mutual support in that practice was what we felt we could have here. He does go. You know.

61
00:10:05,66 --> 00:10:17,3
Kay describing body farm. It's a hundred and fifty acres. Much of which is at a forty five degree. A greater angle.

62
00:10:17,3 --> 00:10:21,03
With lots of forest. When we came here the trees.

63
00:10:21,03 --> 00:10:26,85
They regrouped was about twenty five years old the trees continue to grow taller and taller.

64
00:10:27,3 --> 00:10:38,88
We have very little cleared land really just enough for chewed. And guidance. And we've got. About thirteen dwellings.

65
00:10:38,88 --> 00:10:48,95
Going along to. Two little roads. Most couples or single people have their own shelters.

66
00:10:48,95 --> 00:10:58,52
There's some arrangements where various facilities are shared i i have a set of exploding house that i share.

67
00:10:58,52 --> 00:11:05,02
With my present husband. My son his two sons and. Another woman and her daughter.

68
00:11:05,48 --> 00:11:08,87
So there's lots of different living arrangements.

69
00:11:08,87 --> 00:11:14,73
And then we have this wonderful large community center which we built together some years ago.

70
00:11:14,73 --> 00:11:20,82
Where we get together for dinner. Kasia lee and i parties and meetings. Play together here.

71
00:11:23,3 --> 00:11:29,12
Can't quite seen him been hidden by the heels but it's really very close as the close. Crow flies.

72
00:11:31,87 --> 00:11:36,6
Is a lovely time to will creek down. The bottom of our property.

73
00:11:37,59 --> 00:11:57,22
And we've got another community on one side is a neighbor's and. So sort of commercial operation on the other. So yes.

74
00:11:57,22 --> 00:12:00,8
There wasn't a single shelter here there's a bit of a floor.

75
00:12:00,8 --> 00:12:05,84
From some house that had been chainsawed to bits and taken away.

76
00:12:07,72 --> 00:12:19,95
I lived with my partner at that time in a fifteen foot caravan. Mack ensued lived in a team. And. Down the road.

77
00:12:19,95 --> 00:12:23,18
There were two other guys i guess they must have been intense that was about it.

78
00:12:23,18 --> 00:12:25,66
At the beginning there was about four of us.

79
00:12:25,66 --> 00:12:32,79
And we just straight away had to build a shelter where we could cook and stuff. So we did that in a very piecemeal way.

80
00:12:32,79 --> 00:12:42,82
None. None of us. Had virtually any experience in building. And being very sort of. Idealistic about making it.

81
00:12:42,82 --> 00:12:49,95
Our own way we had no power tools we did all our buildings by hand. Everything by hand. Lot of work.

82
00:12:49,95 --> 00:13:03,55
And a lot of learning. Which is quite fantastic that we took that. We had no water. No nothing and.

83
00:13:03,55 --> 00:13:07,91
It's interesting that in the first year just heaps of people flocked to hear.

84
00:13:07,91 --> 00:13:14,89
I think by the time we were two years old we had thirty people staying here under the most difficult conditions and.

85
00:13:14,89 --> 00:13:22,24
A tiny tiny communal space in which we ate together every day.

86
00:13:22,24 --> 00:13:31,96
And we had eight babies in the first year eight babies in tents mine was born in the caravan and.

87
00:13:31,96 --> 00:13:39,12
So we were busy having babies in building at very basic houses at the same time. It was quite.

88
00:13:39,12 --> 00:13:51,5
It was quite stressful and quite challenging and we had a tremendous sense of helping each other.

89
00:13:51,5 --> 00:13:58,86
People were drawn because they. I mean we immediately had a reputation is a spiritual community.

90
00:13:58,86 --> 00:14:06,63
Which can work both ways people can say very nice things about you know very scathing things about you.

91
00:14:06,63 --> 00:14:13,47
And we've had plenty of. And i'm sure we deserve. You know if you. If you set yourself up.

92
00:14:13,47 --> 00:14:17,09
To have a lot of ideals here are really good. Agate.

93
00:14:17,09 --> 00:14:24,67
But yes a lot of those people who are really interested in meditation practice or buddhism.

94
00:14:24,87 --> 00:14:26,99
You know something like that was what drew them here.

95
00:14:28,59 --> 00:14:36,43
I think that we were very lucky in that the people who began this community it was like a good chemical mixture.

96
00:14:36,43 --> 00:14:46,67
It worked in there was really very little conflict and that attracted people as well.

97
00:14:46,67 --> 00:14:58,09
Well i'd say we experimented with there were inquiry into the basic buddhist precepts switch involve you know killing

98
00:14:58,09 --> 00:15:10,27
no stealing. Issue. Of what's called. False speech no full speech which is truly trying to be as truthful as possible.

99
00:15:10,27 --> 00:15:16,36
Not taking. Intoxicants which was never totally strict but. Was quite strict.

100
00:15:16,36 --> 00:15:24,81
Early on things like that and we also expected everyone to do a retreat every year

101
00:15:24,81 --> 00:15:30,09
and that if someone wanted to join the community that they really needed to know what that was about. So.

102
00:15:30,09 --> 00:15:42,94
To do a retreat was important. Not early on did we fight. Many other teachers around but.

103
00:15:42,94 --> 00:15:54,2
In the later years we've had some wonderful. Spiritual teachers come here. Like teach not. On his feet and me.

104
00:15:54,2 --> 00:16:01,91
The man who we built the meditation center for to teach in comes back he was here again this here christopher.

105
00:16:01,91 --> 00:16:11,23
So we have a very much an ongoing relationship with him. And we've organized. Retreats for being alive.

106
00:16:11,23 --> 00:16:21,51
Sort of in the lineage of christian marriage he and numerous other. Teaches. So.

107
00:16:21,51 --> 00:16:26,98
That was very very obvious at the beginning. It's not like when you were not unique in that diamond and.

108
00:16:26,98 --> 00:16:45,18
Across the ridge. Also has a very strong orientation towards what his spiritual practice to do. Yeah.

109
00:16:45,18 --> 00:16:52,59
It was quite strict i mean when you. So many of his first met. These ideas in india.

110
00:16:52,59 --> 00:17:02,56
Or nepal someplace like that in the idea. What does it mean not to. Any living thing that seem possible but.

111
00:17:02,56 --> 00:17:08,81
Yes i mean in the beginning we didn't kill mosquitoes which bitterness and. When blowflies.

112
00:17:08,81 --> 00:17:15,96
Bit as not blowflies much flies because we didn't kill them we simply tried to rattle their brains.

113
00:17:16,36 --> 00:17:20,74
You know hand so they didn't trouble us too much. And it. I mean.

114
00:17:20,74 --> 00:17:27,76
It's easy to move be cynical or scoff at that now but it's really quite interesting to play with ideas

115
00:17:27,76 --> 00:17:33,91
and see how far you can go with that and. And that's true with.

116
00:17:33,91 --> 00:17:43,99
Looking at all those precepts and i think what we came to. Within a few years was that. There's no actual action or.

117
00:17:43,99 --> 00:17:49,08
Non action that has to be adhered to but that you're conscious all the time of what you're doing.

118
00:17:49,08 --> 00:17:58,62
And more and more that. I think become a shared. Inquiry. Used to really be willing to just say ok well.

119
00:17:59,41 --> 00:18:02,42
Is this really something what i want to do and

120
00:18:02,42 --> 00:18:07,59
when i kill this creature am i aware of it is it necessary is that you know.

121
00:18:07,59 --> 00:18:22,11
Just really thinking about what we do in our lives. Yeah yeah. That's the millet that guy uses that word into.

122
00:18:22,11 --> 00:18:27,2
Instead of meditation and i think everybody here would agree that that's what we're.

123
00:18:27,2 --> 00:18:32,96
That's what you nine says use a dedication to. Inquiring for us selves and.

124
00:18:32,96 --> 00:18:38,53
To share that and to acknowledge it it's a bit different for everybody. But it's really good to share it and.

125
00:18:38,53 --> 00:18:56,07
And have other people reflect back to you how they feel about your inquiry to. You. Yeah.

126
00:18:56,07 --> 00:19:03,32
One of our main claims to fame and i must say that. Being attacked by the government.

127
00:19:03,32 --> 00:19:11,21
Even on the local level it's like an outside threat is a wonderful thing to unite a community and.

128
00:19:11,21 --> 00:19:17,6
My memory may not be as clear as some other people here on that but.

129
00:19:17,6 --> 00:19:26,14
When the fight for the trainee a creek rain forest. Came to a head of course body found many other places around where.

130
00:19:26,14 --> 00:19:28,45
Deserted everyone was down there.

131
00:19:28,45 --> 00:19:38,36
And the local community in some ways took that struggle as a real affront to something that they thought was there is

132
00:19:38,36 --> 00:19:39,72
and.

133
00:19:39,72 --> 00:19:47,3
It was only at that stage that the local council said hey wait a minute you never asked for permission to build on this

134
00:19:47,3 --> 00:19:52,44
land we've never even heard of you. I mean they had to have known. We were doing or were doing but that was.

135
00:19:53,13 --> 00:19:57,98
They just had had enough. With their troublemaking and.

136
00:19:57,98 --> 00:20:10,2
Suddenly said you can't do that and the whole movement from multiple occupancy. So to spring from that conflict.

137
00:20:10,2 --> 00:20:15,94
And a lot of people here were very active in that movement. And in the. What it ended up. Ended up.

138
00:20:16,13 --> 00:20:21,23
Being with the family was that we had demolition demolition nobody's put on to other houses.

139
00:20:21,95 --> 00:20:33,65
Primarily because they didn't have four walls they had three will. Before that there was a lot of question of whether.

140
00:20:33,65 --> 00:20:38,87
We had the right to that our building standards weren't good enough and.

141
00:20:38,87 --> 00:20:44,88
Sydney uni and all kinds of people got involved with testing. The strength of our timbers meeus found out that room.

142
00:20:44,88 --> 00:20:50,95
Round poles are ever so much stronger than a similar thickness of square poles and so on

143
00:20:50,95 --> 00:20:56,2
but in the end we had a demolition order and. Two houses for five years.

144
00:20:56,2 --> 00:21:04,72
Which eventually went to the land and environment court and. We all really enjoyed hearing.

145
00:21:04,72 --> 00:21:12,14
Whatever you call it happened. One of those houses was mine and and.

146
00:21:13,14 --> 00:21:21,94
I look back now and i would feel the same way if it was done over again i'm. I can remember saying to my partner well.

147
00:21:21,94 --> 00:21:28,55
Let's build the bleachers for the audience to watch this place being full does you know how fantastic. Because in fact.

148
00:21:28,55 --> 00:21:36,49
When we all went all of us first. Built here. A very important idea to us was to do minimally.

149
00:21:36,49 --> 00:21:43,59
And to create something where we wouldn't be too tied up into material positions that a house wasn't.

150
00:21:43,59 --> 00:21:48,11
Didn't take a huge investment of time and money. In therefore you have to worry about it.

151
00:21:48,11 --> 00:21:54,73
And that's in the spirit which we approached. That conflict was. Not being terribly worried if we lost.

152
00:21:54,73 --> 00:22:04,11
That it would be quite a good bit of theatre and. Quite a statement. But in fact it did you know and to us and.

153
00:22:04,11 --> 00:22:17,62
We learnt a lot and we became very involved in the community. Because of that. Yeah. Yes. And is a room not a room.

154
00:22:17,62 --> 00:22:26,44
Yeah. And i mean that the questions that the council q c. Put was. You know. Well.

155
00:22:26,44 --> 00:22:37,48
I mean this is terrible what about the welfare of children. Roman snakes coming in. Our q see question what's sleep.

156
00:22:37,48 --> 00:23:03,53
Verandah and lismore if it's got a television and a bed in it. And so it was very interesting. From time. Right here.

157
00:23:03,53 --> 00:23:08,64
You mean in men and women's relationships. I don't know if.

158
00:23:08,64 --> 00:23:19,86
I don't think the actual physical stress is that we underwent such as not having a stove or. Hot water. Or a bathroom.

159
00:23:19,86 --> 00:23:28,14
Or a place to wash nappies. Really was a strain on our relationships. It was. I think a big.

160
00:23:28,14 --> 00:23:36,63
Internal strain for individuals. Because it was like i mean we didn't. None of us grew up in communities. People don't.

161
00:23:36,63 --> 00:23:38,38
In the western world and.

162
00:23:38,38 --> 00:23:45,7
You have to learn all kinds of things which you don't have to know about when you live in a nuclear situation.

163
00:23:45,88 --> 00:23:50,25
So in that way it was very stressful in the fact that.

164
00:23:50,25 --> 00:23:59,74
Things that every family have to do such as nappies is quite a huge job when you don't have much to do it with.

165
00:23:59,74 --> 00:24:05,25
And yet. We had to build our houses and. Cook for thirty people every day.

166
00:24:05,25 --> 00:24:14,33
And no telephone we had to drive the channon to make a phone call and all that sort of thing is.

167
00:24:14,33 --> 00:24:18,09
That's sort of what i meant by stress. Will a lot of.

168
00:24:20,37 --> 00:24:28,28
I'm wondering if i can say if there's any single relationship which remained intact over the period of this community

169
00:24:28,28 --> 00:24:40,34
which is now fifteen years. And i think no. But that is not unlike. People our age. In the wider community.

170
00:24:41,74 --> 00:24:49,04
Some of us have established relationships with people who. On the community. You know like. You could say.

171
00:24:49,04 --> 00:24:53,7
People have changed partners really not quite like that but.

172
00:24:54,45 --> 00:24:55,73
Yes people who have lived here

173
00:24:55,73 --> 00:25:13,39
and dissolve relationships have made new ones with other people i mean this is so cool but it's going to come out.

174
00:25:13,39 --> 00:25:23,87
Well. I don't know a lot about other communities. I thought i think they have a feeling that we communicate.

175
00:25:23,87 --> 00:25:29,53
Really well. Of course there are tensions between us. People.

176
00:25:29,53 --> 00:25:38,00
You know we see things differently want things to be done differently. But we've always managed to get through it with.

177
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:49,05
Real crises. And. Yes it is. We don't leave all that close together. Really moment to moment.

178
00:25:49,05 --> 00:25:53,73
So that's not a really big problem. But just like.

179
00:25:53,73 --> 00:26:01,65
You know i shared a house in the city or anything like most of most of the time i in fact have shared my my.

180
00:26:01,65 --> 00:26:13,47
Shelter with other couples or people in two people in a child or one person and child. And yes that stressful.

181
00:26:13,47 --> 00:26:20,41
But i think lots of people experience. This tresses who don't live in communities to. Students. You know.

182
00:26:20,41 --> 00:26:39,25
It's very much the same. Well. The place was incredibly cheap. It wasn't a real hot property.

183
00:26:39,25 --> 00:26:43,96
It was color it's called rubbish by the locals because it's all trees and scape.

184
00:26:43,96 --> 00:26:51,93
So it was only sixteen thousand dollars and. We decided at the beginning that there'd be one thousand dollars.

185
00:26:51,93 --> 00:26:59,68
So it didn't take long for us to pay for that and.

186
00:26:59,68 --> 00:27:04,69
It was only after a number of years when we realized that for new people joining.

187
00:27:04,69 --> 00:27:08,47
That maybe the share price should go up.

188
00:27:08,47 --> 00:27:15,21
At the moment i think it's still under four thousand dollars for a share it's just very had someone to get us to agree

189
00:27:15,21 --> 00:27:23,81
that they can be a shareholder. Destruction is that we set up. We set ourselves up in the cheap.

190
00:27:23,81 --> 00:27:34,14
Legally in the cheapest way possible which was a company which was sort of. Under a voluntary association.

191
00:27:34,14 --> 00:27:38,34
Because that's a very very cheap way of forming an organisation much cheaper

192
00:27:38,34 --> 00:27:44,72
and simpler than a cooperative so we were a voluntary association. We called ourselves the bloody church.

193
00:27:44,72 --> 00:27:54,8
Churches are voluntary associations and formed a company. And we have. Trustees. Of the land is held in trust but what.

194
00:27:54,8 --> 00:28:01,82
What a voluntary association means that the place cannot be sold it has to be passed on to another such organisation

195
00:28:01,82 --> 00:28:05,99
and that was one of our big ideals was that. Ok.

196
00:28:05,99 --> 00:28:11,95
We're going to get a hold of this in this piece of land can never be bought and sold again.

197
00:28:12,7 --> 00:28:17,53
We decided that shares were. Non-refundable.

198
00:28:17,53 --> 00:28:23,47
And that everything here belong to the community so technically speaking our houses do not belong to us.

199
00:28:23,47 --> 00:28:32,55
They go along to the community. Day to day organization evolved and.

200
00:28:32,55 --> 00:28:39,46
We've got it down pretty well like in the beginning we only had communal cause we had a car a system a car booking

201
00:28:39,46 --> 00:28:48,83
system. Cars had parents who looked you know looked after them. One person did the food ordering another person.

202
00:28:48,83 --> 00:28:55,32
When we did get a telephone. Did the telephone bill. Someone else took care of the car books.

203
00:28:55,32 --> 00:29:03,78
And that's all still in place today. And that's. It wasn't always easy but i think a lot of people would say.

204
00:29:03,78 --> 00:29:14,23
We felt really good. Figuring those things out. So that they were it. We pay into our general kitty. Every week.

205
00:29:14,23 --> 00:29:24,03
We save money. We decide on major expenditures together we operate. I suppose you'd say consensus minus one.

206
00:29:24,28 --> 00:29:30,64
We don't vote. Sometimes we spend an awful lot of time talking about things like.

207
00:29:30,64 --> 00:29:37,93
We might talk when we were going to build a dam we talked about it for about three years every reading. And then.

208
00:29:37,93 --> 00:29:41,92
We switched to some other thorny subject which. You know.

209
00:29:41,92 --> 00:29:47,07
And sometimes i think our meetings are so long is just because we really do like to talk.

210
00:29:47,07 --> 00:29:56,49
And we were too sort of active to do it socially so we only had meetings as excuses to talk for a long time so that.

211
00:30:02,05 --> 00:30:06,5
You know we've just develop strategies for dealing with the stress of it.

212
00:30:06,5 --> 00:30:15,02
Like i can remember early on i get headache side be shaking i feel exhausted irritable after meetings and.

213
00:30:15,02 --> 00:30:20,2
A lot of us is. You know where you sit not being so. It's a one.

214
00:30:20,2 --> 00:30:24,55
Community is a wonderful way of learning not to be so invested in your own opinions.

215
00:30:24,55 --> 00:30:42,41
Because if you have a big investment of that is just how much trouble you can give me. Yeah i do. Yeah.

216
00:30:42,41 --> 00:31:01,56
I do think everyone has had to deal with that and it's gotten a lot out of it. Ok.

217
00:31:01,56 --> 00:31:08,12
You know i when i hear about it it is being studied now so often.

218
00:31:09,39 --> 00:31:18,02
Really likely based which is i mean it's fine it's obviously. Because i'm here for.

219
00:31:18,02 --> 00:31:30,98
Finding a way to live that doesn't tie to the tyranny of. Working. You know. Your life away and.

220
00:31:31,81 --> 00:31:33,8
But i think the same time i.

221
00:31:33,8 --> 00:31:42,1
I wonder how easy you know how hard a time communities can have like that that i just threw up.
