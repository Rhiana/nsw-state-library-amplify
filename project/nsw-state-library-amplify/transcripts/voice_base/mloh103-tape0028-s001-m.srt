1
00:00:15,23 --> 00:00:34,06
Yes. I want to if this is not easy to please. We will see. You know as her just. Own will sing into.

2
00:00:34,06 --> 00:00:41,56
This country just to go out for a ride how did i come to name the prize.

3
00:00:41,56 --> 00:00:45,06
Well back when the icarus hosts of was first happening.

4
00:00:45,06 --> 00:00:50,69
Or even be fooled and actually used to come down he used to go down a bar and. So the nation.

5
00:00:50,69 --> 00:00:55,83
Around broken hated being involved probably from the sixty's.

6
00:00:55,83 --> 00:01:04,78
With the for the new age or the hippie movement as it was. And being somewhat very radical myself.

7
00:01:04,78 --> 00:01:12,7
Looking for an alternative. In life and not being happy with the system with the rot. Of the system.

8
00:01:14,63 --> 00:01:22,69
So they used to venture around going to different places and. Can actually remember.

9
00:01:22,69 --> 00:01:32,75
I think the fistula was advertised quite a lot. And decided to come down and check it out of the group of friends.

10
00:01:32,75 --> 00:01:35,56
I was living in prison at the time.

11
00:01:35,56 --> 00:01:42,44
And living in a community house for me and all star houses a number of us living there.

12
00:01:42,44 --> 00:01:50,04
And we all decided to come down and see what was happening so we came down before the festival. It was sort of.

13
00:01:50,04 --> 00:01:57,48
Interesting. Getting out of it. So the smoking and tripping about it.

14
00:01:57,48 --> 00:02:02,88
It's always good to get out in the country especially if you're tripping on acid as you sort of.

15
00:02:02,88 --> 00:02:09,64
It's nice to get away from people and you can sort of. Be relaxed environment that you feel safe and settle it. So.

16
00:02:10,14 --> 00:02:19,46
Get into nature. So that was a real buzz. Coming down here in his nice area. People seem friendly.

17
00:02:20,14 --> 00:02:31,85
Interesting things going on. And then when the festival was happening. This was quoted as. Just. I suppose the people.

18
00:02:31,85 --> 00:02:37,85
Thing. Apart from the area the land is i mean it's obviously unique. Obviously.

19
00:02:39,13 --> 00:02:44,97
Is different this has a lot to offer the pros so i think the people at the time

20
00:02:44,97 --> 00:02:51,47
when the first of those on it was very colorful. So if i remember it was sort of towards the end of.

21
00:02:51,47 --> 00:02:56,59
When all the festivals were happening from the sixty's. Was when they started you know.

22
00:02:57,18 --> 00:03:08,53
Dying out within this aquarius festival happened and. It was interesting it was it was cool.

23
00:03:08,53 --> 00:03:13,61
By the whole town i suppose his holdall village being there only shops and things and. I will sit up there.

24
00:03:14,29 --> 00:03:27,11
He sort of wander around and help yourself. Get out of it. So that you know the actual hills around at.

25
00:03:27,11 --> 00:03:34,49
When the festival was on. Role was on a virtually directly around the town itself in the people were sort of.

26
00:03:35,71 --> 00:03:47,86
Mingled around the hills and. Camped tents. All sorts of. Unique drawings will lower the temperature on this.

27
00:03:47,86 --> 00:03:56,58
I suppose it was typical. For those the. Festivals around that time. Sort of love experimenting looking searching.

28
00:03:56,58 --> 00:04:17,9
Sort of looking at. Concepts and new ideas. Sort of interacting with different people. Yeah. Hadas.

29
00:04:23,5 --> 00:04:34,26
Highlights highlights. I suppose there was no warning. Syfy cool. Major one that i can think of this is that.

30
00:04:34,26 --> 00:04:42,33
I suppose. The whole essence of the festival in the feeling of the area was. Yeah it's not us it's great you know.

31
00:04:42,33 --> 00:04:50,8
Be nice to be able to live this way. And it's stimulating exciting. It's.

32
00:04:51,74 --> 00:04:57,57
As cool as that after the fists were going back to.

33
00:04:57,57 --> 00:05:03,47
The usual stuff and a half and full back into the system and the rotten.

34
00:05:03,47 --> 00:05:09,74
And not feeling happy about it and then going back down to name been some months later the chicken had to get a good.

35
00:05:11,26 --> 00:05:12,27
Sort of finding it.

36
00:05:12,27 --> 00:05:19,01
Sort of changed it was even a different feeling amongst the people there's some sort of a reason for him to and.

37
00:05:19,01 --> 00:05:23,68
I think it was to do with. You know like with with anything.

38
00:05:23,68 --> 00:05:31,3
If something to actually happen it needs energy to go into it. So i need the energy comes from. And if.

39
00:05:31,3 --> 00:05:37,66
If we're not putting the energy into it. And it's not really happening and. You sort of get people that.

40
00:05:37,66 --> 00:05:44,73
They just appear to go just purely for what they can get out of it and don't put anything into it.

41
00:05:44,73 --> 00:05:51,91
And of course it doesn't work. You get too many people doing that which is the thing start getting resentment.

42
00:05:51,91 --> 00:05:58,47
From other people. Because it's not enhancing is not adding to the whole thing is just taking from.

43
00:05:58,82 --> 00:06:07,55
I think that's why a particular feeling. Of the place and as you know this is suspicion rolls. You know. If you know.

44
00:06:08,85 --> 00:06:19,77
You know what do you want you know what are you doing here you know. What do you want from us. So the thing. Is it was.

45
00:06:19,77 --> 00:06:31,04
Yeah. Yeah. That was a few months. And then i think probably a year. A year and a half after the fist and back and.

46
00:06:31,04 --> 00:06:39,61
That feeling was still strongly there. I suppose also the other thing of.

47
00:06:39,61 --> 00:06:48,13
When the actual communities or communes as they were they were forming and. Co-produce. The.

48
00:06:48,13 --> 00:06:58,13
Just wondering how safe would actually be and if would work and trying to break away from my. Feelings.

49
00:06:58,13 --> 00:07:02,81
Conditionings of security in the system. Breaking away from.

50
00:07:02,81 --> 00:07:08,54
You know these false since it's the security you know having a job and having money and having a car and a house

51
00:07:08,54 --> 00:07:15,62
and you go build a structure around you that you can hide in support you. And all your friends there.

52
00:07:16,4 --> 00:07:27,4
I suppose his friends. And. Sort of breaking away from that and this. I found it was actually very difficult.

53
00:07:27,4 --> 00:07:33,67
Coming to a place where it's sort of it is a different creation then.

54
00:07:33,67 --> 00:07:39,18
Even though it's stimulating exciting they still iffy effect i think as with now.

55
00:07:39,18 --> 00:07:43,97
Well i survive in this sort of life we get out of a life or lose whatever it is.

56
00:07:43,97 --> 00:07:53,25
I already have you consciously pull you know so through that you must challenge. This. Yeah i think.

57
00:07:53,25 --> 00:08:01,33
I've a funny myself and probably also i know. I have these two s. Pigs. In the us. And they go we all do.

58
00:08:01,33 --> 00:08:04,98
A lot of people do we have many different aspects. Whenever he's.

59
00:08:04,98 --> 00:08:11,25
This is to be these two major arrests pick someone is that. I can fit into the system quite easily in play to get.

60
00:08:12,15 --> 00:08:26,3
And it's. Because it's easy to do. You know you can just fall into it if you know you just become like a clown.

61
00:08:26,3 --> 00:08:34,17
Even though. It was easy to do that and to be that. This is others. S. Picture of me that is very radical.

62
00:08:34,17 --> 00:08:41,98
And it sort of says you know i need to be looked at i need to be expressed you know this isn't the philly. Me.

63
00:08:41,98 --> 00:08:45,24
By doing this and. So i find when i look.

64
00:08:45,24 --> 00:08:51,44
Look at that aspect of myself that it wants to challenge all this it doesn't want to play that i will lease.

65
00:08:51,44 --> 00:09:00,79
Rules that. That would create a personal analysis is that the really. I just i don't know i just. Challenge origin.

66
00:09:01,53 --> 00:09:13,08
It wasn't a feeling in me. So. Sort of realizing that this is s. Picked on me that i need to fill.

67
00:09:15,48 --> 00:09:23,59
Like his federal psych i was all. All those pretty terms with oneself and lost all sexuality. The whole long.

68
00:09:26,37 --> 00:09:48,71
These guys. Was. This question. Just recently i find it. Just. He was a creationist. How were they fulfilled.

69
00:09:48,88 --> 00:10:05,85
I don't think they are. If so. I don't really know if my experience. Expectations had been fulfilled.

70
00:10:06,44 --> 00:10:17,23
Because i find i'm still questioning things. I still looking at myself. And what's. Reflecting back around me.

71
00:10:17,23 --> 00:10:23,25
I suppose i wonder if that's just an ongoing thing. And we'd likely how we create things around is and.

72
00:10:23,25 --> 00:10:30,9
We caught up in our own creations and the mold we put into it peaches is gone and they really need to drop all the.

73
00:10:36,76 --> 00:10:43,81
Just recently. I've been looking at how i feel and with where i am now and here i'm feeling clues.

74
00:10:43,81 --> 00:10:55,41
And after being here for ten days. And has developed. And i find it are looking more into my soul to us to.

75
00:10:55,41 --> 00:11:04,63
Maybe looking at things like. Once and selfishness and what we need out of life will feel we need to have a life.

76
00:11:04,63 --> 00:11:09,58
Well what i'm actually doing. In my life is to where i'm putting my energies.

77
00:11:09,58 --> 00:11:15,00
And maybe part of that is still creating what what i was trying to get away from the full

78
00:11:15,00 --> 00:11:22,55
and bring it all here with me and creating it again. A whether it's will actually hear anyone. Sold and.

79
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:36,15
Within ones that are you afraid it. Is. Isolation.

80
00:11:38,03 --> 00:11:45,98
If you want to give it to the query system or thing because that was some time back going back twenty years ago.

81
00:11:46,19 --> 00:11:53,98
And then there was a period or probably ten years before i actually started living here in this area.

82
00:11:53,98 --> 00:12:03,88
And eventually when i made that break came here. I looked at this place. Was this a cattle property thinking.

83
00:12:03,88 --> 00:12:11,25
On the surface it didn't look very good its looked like paddick. But the.

84
00:12:11,48 --> 00:12:21,8
Feeling of the leaves there's the feeling some feeling of it and. That's when i clicked into this where i live and. So.

85
00:12:21,8 --> 00:12:29,7
I decided to buy. Moving here finally breaking over. In the system and moving here.

86
00:12:29,7 --> 00:12:37,94
Then interacting with the land of the peoples. At that particular stage and going through cool.

87
00:12:37,94 --> 00:12:45,14
Major court case which went for eight months in the kitty. So the like of amenities and. No proper roads.

88
00:12:45,14 --> 00:12:53,00
It rained for nearly eight months. Churkin that's what i considered.

89
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:59,45
Even though at times it was very tasty you think shit. But i wanted to take.

90
00:12:59,45 --> 00:13:04,01
What's had the court cases and that crazy thing.

91
00:13:04,01 --> 00:13:12,47
I came here to get away from all that stuff and it's all here if i'm also confronted bought it. But then.

92
00:13:12,47 --> 00:13:18,63
The realisation in that is that. I suppose. Like trying to avoid something or running away from something.

93
00:13:18,63 --> 00:13:24,63
You further cool. The you gotta. You have to confront it and go through.

94
00:13:26,8 --> 00:13:33,35
So also while that was happening in interacting with the land. And that. That was really great in the rain it was cool.

95
00:13:33,35 --> 00:13:44,42
It was the land it was. Digging holes plenty trees. So we could do it on yeah. It was cool cool.

96
00:13:46,79 --> 00:13:53,58
Even the whole pioneering spirit of and the other people sort of moved in. Sort of.

97
00:13:53,58 --> 00:14:03,83
She's funny i had always those people are like it's the old to energies. Tends to attract people to is this.

98
00:14:03,83 --> 00:14:11,25
Supposed light in the they sort of. Want to get away from a system that tends to just clone people. Stereo time.

99
00:14:12,62 --> 00:14:17,02
In that diversity. You can find that point you know.

100
00:14:17,02 --> 00:14:23,3
People can be can think totally different two you can have totally different purpose. Perception of.

101
00:14:23,3 --> 00:14:35,17
Live when it comes to consensus of agreeing that. It is if it's not there. But the other aspect of that is that.

102
00:14:35,49 --> 00:14:43,42
You can learn a lot. When you start interacting with people in these different kostis different ninety's.

103
00:14:43,42 --> 00:14:53,59
Thing a whole lot. And it's interesting. So then getting on with a few years after being.

104
00:14:53,59 --> 00:15:02,76
So really starting to develop in getting into the land and going through different stages of life. Meditating and.

105
00:15:02,76 --> 00:15:11,03
Getting into working meditations. Of seeing people for weeks on end. And great really cool.

106
00:15:11,74 --> 00:15:15,7
Getting into the feeling of the land and. The the vibe of the n.h.

107
00:15:15,7 --> 00:15:20,52
We all whatever it is what if you want to call it real. It was brilliant.

108
00:15:21,27 --> 00:15:31,98
I think those particular to all of that particular time was. Was really pretty good. When i reflect back on it.

109
00:15:31,98 --> 00:15:38,82
It was good because the solitude the feeling of a drug. I get up in the morning and just spend the whole day.

110
00:15:38,82 --> 00:15:43,89
Working in the garden and staying there until the sun went down.

111
00:15:44,55 --> 00:15:49,08
And even if it was rainy days to get out there and good.

112
00:15:50,36 --> 00:16:03,26
And it was a lick it was really would get was it was an enjoy it really. More.

113
00:16:03,26 --> 00:16:11,25
Good just getting out there and just working in the god. But it wasn't really luke. It was. It was an enjoyment it was.

114
00:16:12,29 --> 00:16:21,18
I'd like to say it was a meditation and all of a sudden building in iraq was a kind interlocks. And i started to leave.

115
00:16:21,18 --> 00:16:28,88
And i really enjoyed that. Because just by handling the rocks picking him up.

116
00:16:28,88 --> 00:16:37,94
They you know they had different sizes different take she's feeling about it and and. The weight of the rocks and.

117
00:16:37,94 --> 00:16:45,3
Also there is a feeling like an energy you get from the rocks and. This is an amazing experience.

118
00:16:45,3 --> 00:16:52,13
This is free and i really light and building the wall as this goes when you see i'm finished with it

119
00:16:52,13 --> 00:17:01,6
and you stop being creative with it and. Putting patterns in the walls and stuff. It's just nice. Credos great.

120
00:17:04,54 --> 00:17:23,04
I think getting into a building at us. You can see the houses. In the beginning i used to think i was kidding myself.

121
00:17:23,04 --> 00:17:28,88
Is to tell people he's going to build a house. I used to wonder about things which he had like and build a house on.

122
00:17:28,88 --> 00:17:34,34
But difficult health food for their folly getting to a point where.

123
00:17:34,34 --> 00:17:43,5
I sort of you know really have to do it had to do that so i did and. As foes with my particular nature.

124
00:17:43,5 --> 00:17:59,1
Bring a different. Manic approach of behavior and sort of. Tend to be more into. The tally. You know sort of.

125
00:17:59,1 --> 00:18:16,5
Making things out of so that. The. They looking for sayas. Because it is a word for to. I suppose being particular and.

126
00:18:16,5 --> 00:18:24,91
Going through that experience for a couple is doing it for myself because i wanted to sort of challenge original.

127
00:18:24,91 --> 00:18:29,45
Challenge it was some sort of thing whatever.

128
00:18:29,45 --> 00:18:37,72
With that power tools all by hand and it was a hell of a lot of wood a lot of energy.

129
00:18:37,72 --> 00:18:41,93
And i was used to really stress myself out at times.

130
00:18:41,93 --> 00:18:46,74
Doing it really frustrated because of the hitting in the aisle

131
00:18:46,74 --> 00:18:56,31
and sort of miss it which is almost something which is you know you get really aggro invalidly throw that amor over the

132
00:18:56,31 --> 00:19:05,88
roof or the early pistol for the. Jump up and down and what it is and risk the day looking for the hannah. To.

133
00:19:10,91 --> 00:19:19,26
I suppose that had a sensory war to her and maybe. I wonder that. Things we do that we don't realize will we.

134
00:19:19,26 --> 00:19:23,23
You know that you get satisfaction that it was sense of achievement or whatever.

135
00:19:23,23 --> 00:19:23,95
I think

136
00:19:23,95 --> 00:19:29,73
when you do something that someone does your pat on the back that in some way that enhances you to to make you feel

137
00:19:29,73 --> 00:19:35,65
good about it and that it was great and people say you know he is good

138
00:19:35,65 --> 00:19:38,44
and then i think i hear that silver now i look at it

139
00:19:38,44 --> 00:19:47,14
and i think give us a house after he says they had to really think of it that i would feel that you know it was my

140
00:19:47,14 --> 00:19:52,32
sweat and blood that went into it and i had painted for it i was sort of forgotten. Or don't want to remember all that.

141
00:19:53,5 --> 00:20:00,21
I think it is now. But i don't know whether i do it again. If i did i'd do it differently.

142
00:20:00,21 --> 00:20:21,74
I wouldn't do it the same for use power tools. It's part of hating generators. As for that.

143
00:20:21,74 --> 00:20:31,33
What's going on with the war. We a lot of his he called them. The next stage of. Of a growth of development.

144
00:20:31,33 --> 00:20:38,42
Is this a good word to use i think growth is better. Of the village of bill and bill includes.

145
00:20:38,42 --> 00:20:46,04
And it is a village to village. With the commercial center of life. And i can see that.

146
00:20:46,04 --> 00:20:54,56
Yes great be good to have a commercial center down there. Have really santas. Commercials and a village. Santa.

147
00:20:54,56 --> 00:21:05,31
So to life the heart of the village and us are that just remind of each is it. And this fictive being in a community.

148
00:21:05,31 --> 00:21:11,79
And even though it's not a commune it's a community. Just like. Villages that are community.

149
00:21:11,79 --> 00:21:19,95
Because something about this one parcel of land or whatever disease.

150
00:21:19,95 --> 00:21:24,25
That it is i'm finding there is like an extended family. And even.

151
00:21:24,25 --> 00:21:32,4
Even if there's people here that you mind if a tool to. He still had the sense of. Finding his place.

152
00:21:35,78 --> 00:21:46,12
I think this is sort of interesting it's clear it's got a lot of good aspects to it. Sometimes you know. He said.

153
00:21:46,12 --> 00:22:00,8
This is the. I suppose it's the yeah. I suppose you do and i think maybe it's something he sort of take for granted.

154
00:22:00,8 --> 00:22:11,25
Decisions and recently. I've been looking at what i'm doing here and what i'm getting out of this place and.

155
00:22:11,67 --> 00:22:16,95
Is it just. What are we creating his she's of the view of over again.

156
00:22:16,95 --> 00:22:22,79
Because i can see that he has some food for you if you kill a family stuff.

157
00:22:23,28 --> 00:22:29,44
You go to parties and it all revolves around the family structure. Has johnny going at school and.

158
00:22:29,44 --> 00:22:40,93
You know winds of the school. Fight is on all that sort of stuff and. To me i find it just is.

159
00:22:40,93 --> 00:22:49,19
I suppose there's no diff than that for me really. And especially for my radical son.

160
00:22:49,19 --> 00:22:58,43
And i think this is really where a lot of the this is really a lot of why aren't they looking at that if you will ok.

161
00:22:58,43 --> 00:23:05,54
If that's not what i want what i do something about it with radicals. Side. Already expressing that.

162
00:23:05,54 --> 00:23:14,63
To see what happens will you have be honest with that that i speak to listen. And by doing that. Finding that.

163
00:23:14,63 --> 00:23:20,91
The reaction coming back. Is. Yeah why not do it. Give it to them.

164
00:23:20,91 --> 00:23:32,19
There are other people other and she said that a similar one. The same thing and. Feel the need for that too. So.

165
00:23:32,19 --> 00:23:39,3
Ok i start doing that and. If that draws other energies other people to feel the same.

166
00:23:39,3 --> 00:23:50,48
Then why don't you know what i have done. I suppose for. Three.

167
00:23:50,48 --> 00:23:58,9
Bring out already close to what are called radical these new concepts of the way we live.

168
00:23:58,9 --> 00:24:05,61
Rather than how we've brought off of conditions. To feel we should. We should live life.

169
00:24:05,61 --> 00:24:14,00
In this new killer family thing the. The marriage thing that the mild female of one to one. A lot sort of stuff.

170
00:24:14,00 --> 00:24:26,87
That possibly. I think there's very few people that could really get heated will find themselves and. That's with her.

171
00:24:26,87 --> 00:24:38,46
That. This one thing even mild a female. Thing that i think very few people like shirley find that totally fulfilling.

172
00:24:38,46 --> 00:24:42,66
But they tend to just go along with it if we close that's why it is.

173
00:24:42,66 --> 00:24:48,33
And they say they don't question their role and say they find they can't or they don't want to.

174
00:24:49,72 --> 00:24:59,67
And that possibly oh i feel that they live.

175
00:24:59,67 --> 00:25:06,38
It so it's all interaction will possibly just for the detainees interaction. And that.

176
00:25:06,38 --> 00:25:12,45
We're restricting as cells in a one to one relationship that we know a leveling ourselves to to interact

177
00:25:12,45 --> 00:25:23,27
or to experience for life. And things like how we interact with people here. If you go to a social.

178
00:25:23,27 --> 00:25:31,32
These limitations a little. Even if you may want to feel that you want it here to that person will they much to you.

179
00:25:31,32 --> 00:25:36,63
He's too restrictive for these limitations. So you play along with it.

180
00:25:36,63 --> 00:25:46,57
And then coming away from that situation i think it can be done that already for him. You know you.

181
00:25:46,57 --> 00:25:48,38
He just not feeling something in yourself

182
00:25:48,38 --> 00:25:55,58
and i think it's a spiritual aspect if you saw of myself that you're talking about myself. Maybe i find it.

183
00:25:55,58 --> 00:26:05,82
Not for filling in most virtuous bit. Of the issues related to the injury i.

184
00:26:12,17 --> 00:26:23,45
Being get a first person myself relating to me. To my own gayness maybe yes. I suppose a g.'s. But i do.

185
00:26:23,45 --> 00:26:32,75
I think even if a person that was so cool straighter hitcher sexual. I think that same thing leads to the pine.

186
00:26:32,75 --> 00:26:41,56
Sexuality i think. We were all just a sexual with it with homosexuals. Bisexual or heterosexual this was categorizing.

187
00:26:41,56 --> 00:26:49,97
It's a life away. And sure you need to use those words for expression. But the realisation of where is that is just.

188
00:26:49,97 --> 00:26:56,96
Individuality. It's just individuals. I sexual and.

189
00:26:56,96 --> 00:27:04,24
I suppose for myself in and have to question my own sexuality and with the sisterhood growing up in a system that.

190
00:27:04,24 --> 00:27:06,13
Conditions us that.

191
00:27:06,13 --> 00:27:16,98
Heterosexuality is how it should be and that homosexuality is bad or wrong or evil or something like that.

192
00:27:16,98 --> 00:27:22,62
I suppose that in itself. Has made me question because i have a feeling toward something.

193
00:27:22,62 --> 00:27:28,8
And then a system that's telling me that you can't do that or you shouldn't do that. It contradicts.

194
00:27:28,8 --> 00:27:35,76
So it's something i had to look at in myself and come to terms with it

195
00:27:35,76 --> 00:27:45,44
and i suppose by that is accepting my own sexuality. But and with that. I mean except as a sexuality.

196
00:27:45,44 --> 00:27:53,33
And then you can either. Fit it into a particular sector of the system like the you know.

197
00:27:53,33 --> 00:27:58,67
The gay ghetto the gay movement of. You know whether it be the men's movement or.

198
00:27:58,67 --> 00:28:04,96
If you are a woman with a lens or you don't have to be alone with the women's movement or whatever.

199
00:28:04,96 --> 00:28:17,42
Whether it's a capitalism. Of socialism or whatever. This is where you want to fit in to a life. And.

200
00:28:17,42 --> 00:28:28,44
I suppose coming here. Of evil is so. Because of life for myself in my view. Will my spiritual less pay.

201
00:28:28,44 --> 00:28:36,72
To live a feeling in the world of film or digital life rather than just following a routine. The system.

202
00:28:38,44 --> 00:29:01,43
I suppose was and stimulating when i was full was a rush. I think it's a hard life. What. What is my spiritual aspect.

203
00:29:01,43 --> 00:29:10,29
I could say something valid that i could change on that. Next that. But i'm trying to find it. I suppose.

204
00:29:11,88 --> 00:29:22,3
Feeling of the long range of racial harmony and. I suppose some positive esp a love that i consider love is possible.

205
00:29:22,3 --> 00:29:26,37
And even as for those that they could if i speak to life which would come into the ages.

206
00:29:26,37 --> 00:29:31,12
So i think it's a question of them. Using would see you. I don't see you could just say.

207
00:29:31,12 --> 00:29:38,68
You can put your actual feelings this fishery your fuel your spiritual aspect of. Feelings into words.

208
00:29:38,68 --> 00:29:56,22
She said possible. It's ten hundred pages. I just find it hard as for those. I suppose is a harmonious feeling.

209
00:29:56,22 --> 00:30:05,57
And that includes everything. Positive nature to the. Yeah it'll feel like i feel a whole more harmonious.

210
00:30:05,57 --> 00:30:16,86
With these trees around this greenery you haven't got a. I had a concrete jungle where it's still corners and angles.

211
00:30:18,99 --> 00:30:24,4
You know you. You. You have a system where you've got to follow this particular line.

212
00:30:24,4 --> 00:30:38,33
If you go down the road you can go for you could of had come for you. You could a follower. A rigid a rigid colds.

213
00:30:38,48 --> 00:30:52,17
Yeah there. And i think in that heat. I find in myself that it was the stopping of a lot of mine.

214
00:30:52,17 --> 00:31:01,66
And how i feel it should or should be the. You notice a slight flaw or this is this. Put it this way it is flow us but.

215
00:31:10,95 --> 00:31:16,87
Yeah ride. Being gay and being here in this place. And bill includes. So who's coming here and.

216
00:31:16,87 --> 00:31:24,09
Moving from queensland where at the time. It was still illegal to be caylee you know the little is.

217
00:31:24,09 --> 00:31:33,02
Was still against homosexuality. For and even though i had sort of already confront of my sexuality.
