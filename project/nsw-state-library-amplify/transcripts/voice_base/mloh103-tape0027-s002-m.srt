1
00:00:07,86 --> 00:00:17,04
Iow you know we have a son and. He lives in lismore and. Really. He's not really interested in this experiment at all.

2
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:25,55
He came here when he was sixteen and. He was too young to see any real benefit in it and too old to be to be.

3
00:00:25,55 --> 00:00:35,56
To be formed by. My oldest daughter. The first time she was it was we were living in a tent.

4
00:00:35,56 --> 00:00:37,72
And she came here and it was just a bare paddock.

5
00:00:37,72 --> 00:00:44,81
There's no trees there wasn't a tree from that into this and you know. There are no trees at all.

6
00:00:44,81 --> 00:00:48,97
She's told me years later i wonder what our other mother and dad going to do either.

7
00:00:50,84 --> 00:01:00,98
However a few years after she came to live here. And that's nice. Family quiet time with.

8
00:01:00,98 --> 00:01:09,31
Now having two family houses here. There's no reason. Son of the wanted to you could come and go to cabin on either.

9
00:01:09,31 --> 00:01:23,45
Well you know. So that's good that's putting an experience for years probably being. I've done many things in my life.

10
00:01:23,45 --> 00:01:30,8
In the jazz musician. Painter say human lives or you know all sorts of things. You know.

11
00:01:30,8 --> 00:01:45,21
I think this is given me more interest than possibly any other thing in my life. Watching me. Developing and helping.

12
00:01:45,21 --> 00:01:52,31
Yeah it's been a rewarding. Sort of experience and to see the village now. Just expanding.

13
00:01:52,31 --> 00:02:02,24
I know that building down there. Is going to create activity and i know what happens when the pool. Grows so long as.

14
00:02:02,24 --> 00:02:19,69
If the dream of that. Expansion. With all the right sort of ideal. States would they. And i'm sure you're ready.

15
00:02:19,69 --> 00:02:29,03
For me. Bill includes all of us an economic experiment. Not something in the best sense.

16
00:02:29,03 --> 00:02:33,05
It was an experiment in people's hearts. Everybody participated.

17
00:02:33,05 --> 00:02:44,76
And so i still do regard this as a major change in my life of which i got an enormous benefit.

18
00:02:44,76 --> 00:02:53,93
I've also pulled my hair out now and then and wonder why i was doing all this stuff. But. A major change in career.

19
00:02:53,93 --> 00:03:01,36
From someone who was climbing to corporate and some other government letter.

20
00:03:01,36 --> 00:03:05,55
Had to get on that path and actually started from nothing.

21
00:03:05,55 --> 00:03:08,71
Being a free consultant to the whole village

22
00:03:08,71 --> 00:03:14,57
and i was many needs from filling out forms to getting homeowners grants to dealing with councils and so on

23
00:03:14,57 --> 00:03:19,82
and interest. But the benefits of that is just to give you an example. One.

24
00:03:19,82 --> 00:03:23,32
I've started to go overseas consultancy work

25
00:03:23,32 --> 00:03:29,36
and nine hundred eighty six in the been invited to in seychelles botswana india. Working.

26
00:03:29,36 --> 00:03:34,67
Essential with communities which have the same legal structures we have multiple occupancies

27
00:03:34,67 --> 00:03:44,15
or in some cases of course government departments to do with structures and. So changing.

28
00:03:44,15 --> 00:03:52,74
A lot of thoughts into realities where are now exporting our systems we develop here. Out of poverty.

29
00:03:52,74 --> 00:03:59,31
This whole place is to first. Sold our village in australia. It was built not by government brains.

30
00:03:59,56 --> 00:04:05,8
It was built by poverty people couldn't afford anything else. And now we're exporting that knowledge.

31
00:04:06,52 --> 00:04:13,06
See there's a major growth industry. So i could say at the end of ten years. Professionally as well as.

32
00:04:13,06 --> 00:04:20,56
Emotionally again a lock. I don't think i can recommend a therapy i really believe that it's.

33
00:04:20,56 --> 00:04:23,09
It's at has its deficits as well.

34
00:04:23,09 --> 00:04:32,73
But certainly make me a healthier and stronger than i would have been in the city and. In terms of.

35
00:04:32,73 --> 00:04:39,04
Family law i couldn't have been better than to tell you that a lot of the phone. Between living in a flat.

36
00:04:39,04 --> 00:04:45,7
With the neighbors yelling. I'm fat and i can. Ambulances going by sound to a matter where.

37
00:04:45,7 --> 00:04:50,93
And sitting in your own god given nature reserve and nothing but cook a beret and wallabies go on around and.

38
00:04:51,89 --> 00:04:57,67
And your thing of course nurturing friendship. Media and in the. Ten years before it came to bill and cliff.

39
00:04:57,99 --> 00:05:03,74
I didn't make one. Strong friend. I had acquaintances. I exchanged ideas.

40
00:05:04,18 --> 00:05:13,85
I never lost my heart over anybody living here for ten years. I've developed. Beautiful friendships. Of a level.

41
00:05:13,85 --> 00:05:22,31
I didn't think was possible really and. So that has been helpful. Benefit a q.r. I.q.

42
00:05:22,31 --> 00:05:26,85
You know what the community means you know the person that is the sonne.

43
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:30,78
Quiet person that speaks only seldom yet of what you can burlai own.

44
00:05:30,78 --> 00:05:36,3
You don't want to do you can go into a car for wonderful freedom to read to have a feeling of belonging to a village

45
00:05:36,3 --> 00:05:43,06
where you want to race and not absolutely certain that are you two or three years duration.

46
00:05:43,06 --> 00:05:51,81
Members said to me one day said. The most beautiful thing in my life. Is being allowed to be here.

47
00:05:51,81 --> 00:06:05,15
To play in the growth of. It's the idea that it's good and something that. Your reward for others to see it happen.

48
00:06:05,15 --> 00:06:14,9
As an economy. That i would put an equation to it. Because there is a direct relationship between work. None paid for.

49
00:06:14,9 --> 00:06:23,13
Which is absurd. In society unless you're a volunteer worker here with the whole economy is based on that. Unpaid work.

50
00:06:23,13 --> 00:06:28,77
And the payment for that is an emotional. Wealth and which is. You because you don't do it for yourself.

51
00:06:28,77 --> 00:06:30,51
You do it for the community.

52
00:06:30,51 --> 00:06:33,55
And somehow it comes back to you and it flows around

53
00:06:33,55 --> 00:06:39,09
and it's something that conventional economists of directionless kind do not recognize.

54
00:06:39,09 --> 00:06:45,83
Your doing this and somebody else is doing that yeah. There is old it looks like it's a movement of. All reality.

55
00:06:45,83 --> 00:06:51,15
That in conventional economics is not being measured. It always has to be g.d.p.

56
00:06:51,15 --> 00:06:55,34
and Output and growth and so on but we are talking about a different thing we're still about people

57
00:06:55,34 --> 00:07:02,49
and they're talking about recycling some shitty. Economic system. And we're talking about recycling. People.

58
00:07:02,49 --> 00:07:10,24
I give you a key example of what what just how how sound. The new economics is the definition of wealth.

59
00:07:10,46 --> 00:07:17,8
Now you go to any conventional economist. Any government economist and wealth will be defined as. Assets and income.

60
00:07:17,8 --> 00:07:24,98
And so wrong. Totally completely wrong that only defines half the energy of a single time.

61
00:07:26,06 --> 00:07:32,89
Now if i can make a hundred dollars a day in one second and have the rest of the day to listen to the sum of birds.

62
00:07:32,89 --> 00:07:37,63
I must by definition be wealthier than the guy who does the same hundred dollars in say twenty four hours.

63
00:07:38,46 --> 00:07:48,38
So time is a real essence of. Of all of wealth in this economy here. And of course you cannot do it in isolation.

64
00:07:48,38 --> 00:07:53,31
We are part of a system. But here. We recognize those hidden parts of the system.

65
00:07:53,43 --> 00:08:01,99
And one of the things we've lost over the years right throughout the world. Is we have given our. Our neighborhood.

66
00:08:01,99 --> 00:08:09,07
Sense our sense of community. Progressively over to how. Iran higher authorities. First from the church and.

67
00:08:09,07 --> 00:08:12,29
Psychiatrist to state government a federal government united nations and ends of day.

68
00:08:12,29 --> 00:08:18,13
And there's nothing wrong with that because we need strong central decision making obviously. But we shouldn't lose.

69
00:08:18,13 --> 00:08:24,87
That sense of community. And that's how you play into trees. But telling your kids. If you plant that tree.

70
00:08:25,2 --> 00:08:29,87
We look up to you be a good boy. You know. And he does it for free.

71
00:08:29,87 --> 00:08:36,38
And he gets an emotional charge and love out of it and. I found the same thing here. Using years of.

72
00:08:36,38 --> 00:08:41,04
Getting myself in the eight economic side. Into deeper and deeper financial trouble.

73
00:08:41,04 --> 00:08:50,32
But into be economics or live like a king. I love it. Yes definitely a stand of the thing for quality of life.

74
00:08:50,32 --> 00:08:54,61
We have to move away from a rigidly defined set.

75
00:08:54,61 --> 00:09:01,64
That can see people in so-called third world countries being defined as being on the bottom of the poverty line.

76
00:09:01,64 --> 00:09:07,00
Yet they've got a house. They've got an orchard got clean. They've got a wonderful.

77
00:09:07,00 --> 00:09:13,74
Into a relationship but they don't have to cd player. Therefore to pour. Or they don't have a wage packet.

78
00:09:13,74 --> 00:09:19,64
Because they work in the field deaf or dÃ©cor it's a nonsense. If i would be a radical revolutionary.

79
00:09:20,53 --> 00:09:28,16
But sometimes i wish i was. I would. I would really i would transform the whole the whole.

80
00:09:28,16 --> 00:09:32,69
Nonsense of economics i would rip the guts out of economics teaching at universities.

81
00:09:32,69 --> 00:09:38,76
And i would actually make income though that their. London school of economics has done mall.

82
00:09:38,76 --> 00:09:43,81
To create the problems the world suffered from now than any other institution.

83
00:09:43,81 --> 00:09:51,18
John i went to holland school of economics which is just like the one of them a top school.

84
00:09:51,18 --> 00:09:57,44
And my school president who is now seventy nine years old from that time and we write regularly.

85
00:09:58,03 --> 00:10:05,56
We discussed these things. How our entire profession. Has sold out to the dollar. How greed is the operative word.

86
00:10:05,56 --> 00:10:07,01
Of the. Entire system.

87
00:10:07,16 --> 00:10:15,19
I mean this is the man who i took a hit thirty years off of the european leadership team in business messages saying

88
00:10:15,19 --> 00:10:18,26
the system doesn't work. We all know it isn't work.

89
00:10:19,1 --> 00:10:26,74
So what we could have to do is we're going to have to empower the lifestyle i would like to see the harm in falling

90
00:10:26,74 --> 00:10:28,23
into dirt farming.

91
00:10:28,23 --> 00:10:31,03
I'd like to people to wake up at night i'm a freak of the morning

92
00:10:31,03 --> 00:10:35,48
and ask him what would you like to do that say not to plant a tree a lock to grow my own vote.

93
00:10:35,48 --> 00:10:44,4
No more dense and they're saying. I want that new cd player. You know. You don't need it. When are we on a sly.

94
00:10:44,4 --> 00:10:54,88
Aid society generally all across the face of the earth. I feel is on a very slippery slide down. You know you know.

95
00:10:54,88 --> 00:11:02,16
Of a lever it's like a horse ride you've lost the reins your feet are out of the stirrups you galloping headlong. Down.

96
00:11:02,47 --> 00:11:14,2
I think. When we get to the bottom of whatever this steep slope happens to be. I think places like will and curse.

97
00:11:14,2 --> 00:11:20,67
Will be there for the reconstruction. It would seem we're going from strength to strength of the system.

98
00:11:20,67 --> 00:11:23,27
As having a hard another time here. So you say well.

99
00:11:24,81 --> 00:11:29,6
Because we may this particular place may not survive because it could. If that.

100
00:11:29,6 --> 00:11:36,49
Crunch comes this could be just hours or ron. You know we could all be dead you know that it's places like this.

101
00:11:36,49 --> 00:11:46,62
That will survive where your soil is be nurtured. And food will grow. It's not easy to grow. If you were you without.

102
00:11:46,62 --> 00:11:54,54
Chemicals. And how. How can it be easy when you land has been ruined. Yet when you teach your kids.

103
00:11:54,54 --> 00:12:00,1
You know indigenous language. You don't cut them into the indigenous knowledge of plant life.

104
00:12:00,1 --> 00:12:01,56
To take land in a lack of leach are you.

105
00:12:02,51 --> 00:12:07,17
You're not you're not taking your kids out and actually show them how to plant. Of food.

106
00:12:07,17 --> 00:12:13,86
I mean this should be standard thing or in the curriculum. Sure they should. Are they should absolutely.

107
00:12:13,86 --> 00:12:20,42
Without that you're not going to be your own members and as you'll get all the english. Guy here today.

108
00:12:20,42 --> 00:12:26,95
Steven lisa tell you it's all yours guys in my are a.j. and. The jazz face. You know we were brought up.

109
00:12:26,95 --> 00:12:33,81
Within probably thirty miles of each other it was weird. However.

110
00:12:34,65 --> 00:12:44,31
How much more do you want here and i want to say one thing the. Chance you say it while you're thinking of it and that.

111
00:12:44,31 --> 00:12:50,96
When i hear. John talking about the system collapsing and it's a reality in our minds that it could happen.

112
00:12:51,43 --> 00:12:53,32
Certainly do. The indicators i'm very good.

113
00:12:55,8 --> 00:13:01,93
I sometimes wish that we'd have more government cooperation that if you're really.

114
00:13:03,15 --> 00:13:10,35
I'd love to work with governments on a year or two to actually. Do these things on a large scale i mean.

115
00:13:10,35 --> 00:13:13,57
You can spend ten years of your life.

116
00:13:13,57 --> 00:13:17,91
Proving something that everybody knows which is that you get healthier when you plant your own garden.

117
00:13:17,91 --> 00:13:26,99
You can get a happier if you have good friends. Let's now. Let's not take this incredible discovery. Into camera.

118
00:13:27,24 --> 00:13:34,72
And that is actually saying that's let's do it. You know. Let's do it get away. Nifty let's take these people.

119
00:13:34,72 --> 00:13:40,62
And that's and let's give them something you. You could do is heaps of land. Which is misused.

120
00:13:40,62 --> 00:13:49,04
That can be really lovely that can be brought in you will go in you know. You want to say something. Yes where you are.

121
00:13:49,04 --> 00:13:57,48
Giveaways on the you just grab a bunch of flies around with you know school. Going to ask you a question.

122
00:13:57,48 --> 00:14:04,16
Verse so we can say one more thing. I don't know what strikes you is the main thing. You're outside.

123
00:14:04,16 --> 00:14:33,54
You can see some of it and we can. Hear about bill. It's different when you're on one side. But you know. And i work.

124
00:14:35,74 --> 00:14:42,99
With him yet. How will you know your timetable is very complicated.

125
00:14:44,72 --> 00:14:52,59
If the father has all of the models all the good side countable. The dominant and. Buddy. They're really nice.

126
00:14:53,52 --> 00:15:01,25
You know they're really dives. But it's. It's that. The religious trip. You know you couldn't do that. Buddy.

127
00:15:01,25 --> 00:15:08,14
Trip with one hundred fifteen people like we did. When we had a guy. In our living body farm.

128
00:15:08,14 --> 00:15:12,09
After ten years living here didn't get anything for his house because it belongs to the commune.

129
00:15:12,09 --> 00:15:17,71
And the effort can start again it's very difficult to do that. It's an unrealistic model as a monist three.

130
00:15:17,71 --> 00:15:27,94
Car right here. Yep or religious retreat. Right and then we need does place. We do. But as a model for the massive.

131
00:15:27,94 --> 00:15:33,67
Resettlement that's got to take place. It doesn't work.

132
00:15:33,67 --> 00:15:48,36
So we could get into trouble knowing god we're not rival you know we cannot be no matter how much we would all like to

133
00:15:48,36 --> 00:15:58,31
be. We are not. That's why we call our meeting a residence meeting. Tangible cause as a tribal me where you say.

134
00:15:58,31 --> 00:16:12,24
We understand that tribalism. Is for tribal people. And even. Having trouble living. Tribally. Nowadays. So this is.

135
00:16:12,24 --> 00:16:18,12
There are going to be others. There are going to be others. That will come along. Which will be different.

136
00:16:18,12 --> 00:16:23,99
I see it happening in the suburbs i really do not see. What would stop.

137
00:16:25,05 --> 00:16:30,59
Well directed government programs into the suburbs into small towns that in essence.

138
00:16:30,59 --> 00:16:35,64
Are taking and employ people and supporting mothers and certain pensions like that

139
00:16:35,64 --> 00:16:40,06
and make them contribute to society i really believe. After ten years of living here.

140
00:16:40,06 --> 00:16:46,65
In what something new described as so security has been our kind. To so security system.

141
00:16:46,65 --> 00:16:51,51
Undermining more than a does good. I'm not saying you can just change it and take it away.

142
00:16:51,51 --> 00:16:57,16
That is not enough another thing i'm saying you should direct it in a more meaningful way. More than saying to mr i.

143
00:16:57,16 --> 00:17:03,73
Here is your money. Do as you please you are a free individual. That is your bread. You can drink it.

144
00:17:03,73 --> 00:17:06,18
You can gamble it you can do what you want to.

145
00:17:06,18 --> 00:17:14,39
That's for you to live on what it misses is again a part of the equation that money. Must flow back into society.

146
00:17:14,39 --> 00:17:17,59
And therefore i think it should come tied. If you live in a community.

147
00:17:17,59 --> 00:17:20,99
Your breathe the same air your walk on the sidewalk. You.

148
00:17:20,99 --> 00:17:26,46
You get the protection of a friend news of a deaf we should contribute to it. Well you know those little schemes.

149
00:17:27,05 --> 00:17:31,45
There are some around where zoe lived in red hill in brisbane opposite.

150
00:17:31,45 --> 00:17:40,3
There were six houses and they were owned by a co-operative. And you got it for a very small amount of money.

151
00:17:40,3 --> 00:17:47,88
But you didn't you never did like if you lived that he's sorry. See you later. Argue that it is raining.

152
00:17:47,88 --> 00:17:51,05
And united behind that that got to the culture of god

153
00:17:51,05 --> 00:17:56,98
and a massive culture gotten went right down the back of the whole of the six houses.

154
00:17:56,98 --> 00:18:04,04
They were virtually fluid free you know it can be done. It can be done but i believe what is required now.

155
00:18:04,04 --> 00:18:08,67
Is that government takes up one of the mentors. Step. And applies. See the e.p.a.

156
00:18:08,67 --> 00:18:14,88
Which is commune development employment program to adult to adult. Not as an exclusive measure.

157
00:18:14,88 --> 00:18:21,91
No as a new measure that you are allowed to settle a bit of land where you don't get the money directly your.

158
00:18:21,91 --> 00:18:23,00
Residents get it.

159
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:26,57
And that has a management structure like we've got here and it says ok you get your money

160
00:18:26,57 --> 00:18:31,14
but you were forty hours a week. Doing office work to do in the ukraine employment in this book.

161
00:18:31,14 --> 00:18:33,19
To the money is there already.

162
00:18:33,19 --> 00:18:37,88
It's a nonsense to ask someone here saying go look for a job because right now a job in five hundred miles.

163
00:18:38,76 --> 00:18:43,79
Even if you try. Not if you did do would be five thousand people before the owner and when it was too early.

164
00:18:43,79 --> 00:18:50,3
So what you should do is saying. As john said earlier. The system. Doesn't recognize the real work.

165
00:18:50,3 --> 00:18:56,24
Therefore that the money flow into the village. Therefore. Let the village and. Employ people as artists as.

166
00:18:56,24 --> 00:19:04,02
Guest people as pothole or whatever you have and. Then you have a locally based economy. Same money.

167
00:19:04,02 --> 00:19:09,08
Same exercise c.d.p. Cost twenty percent more than the dull cost it's a very wise investment.

168
00:19:09,08 --> 00:19:14,59
It would change the landscape. Of australia overnight in terms of people's perception of how to tackle the future.

169
00:19:15,17 --> 00:19:17,95
I think the biggest problem i have today.

170
00:19:17,95 --> 00:19:22,31
Is that i don't see that sense doing this in a sense we haven't just discussion.

171
00:19:22,45 --> 00:19:29,17
I don't see that reflected to a national level. And i don't see it as being. Environmental matters.

172
00:19:30,2 --> 00:19:36,52
Just being used as a bloody football you know they grab it if they think it's a few votes in the eye knock it down if

173
00:19:36,52 --> 00:19:42,7
they think there's a few votes that way you know. However. We're rapidly coming to the stage where.

174
00:19:44,66 --> 00:19:52,67
Something is going to have to be done. When we can no longer walk outside the front door in daylight hours.

175
00:19:53,37 --> 00:19:58,4
People will start to get water. You know i don't think people don't really want to be trouble or die.

176
00:19:58,4 --> 00:20:06,62
You know what we're going to have to be you know a bloody reflective salute you know..

177
00:20:02,51 --> 00:20:08,35
Sometimes i wonder we were now living in a day and age where you are being peddled. U.v. Shielding clothing is.

178
00:20:08,35 --> 00:20:12,91
Slip on a hat put on fifteen plus and you go outside. And then you're saying.

179
00:20:12,91 --> 00:20:20,43
Well the air pollution problem is not really that bad just yet we have a factor of three point two leaders i mean.

180
00:20:20,43 --> 00:20:27,81
At what point do we say you know. Well look it's even crazier. A place like this which was a model.

181
00:20:27,81 --> 00:20:34,89
In an area which acts like a model and one of the many areas around the world is in fact being discriminated.

182
00:20:34,89 --> 00:20:44,27
To the point it has a hard time sustaining itself. We still have state government. In effect. While undermining.

183
00:20:44,27 --> 00:20:50,38
Essential parts of our local economy. Because it doesn't recognize it. Just yet. I mean.

184
00:20:51,5 --> 00:20:56,99
At this day and age it's crazy. As one of them.

185
00:20:56,99 --> 00:21:05,48
When you learn to use one of them it would also go with waste disposal toxic algae. It goes with. State system.

186
00:21:05,48 --> 00:21:11,34
Dispersion of grants. And so on. I found over the years to government.

187
00:21:11,8 --> 00:21:17,21
We always assume too much brains in the government. You know we. Big big government is a system.

188
00:21:17,21 --> 00:21:23,1
And the flow of money like an ab. And if we're coming back in for the tide of taxation.

189
00:21:23,28 --> 00:21:27,99
We've got several hundred million a billion years going into the treasury converse.

190
00:21:27,99 --> 00:21:31,1
And then in texas reimbursement comes out again and.

191
00:21:31,1 --> 00:21:37,03
Goes back and forth in government in people that is a very moron a process very slow to change.

192
00:21:38,23 --> 00:21:42,58
So you'll find that there is established ways of getting money into the community.

193
00:21:43,06 --> 00:21:49,11
We pay our farmers at c s r o for research we support our rule industry we want to put some money into the sugar

194
00:21:49,11 --> 00:21:54,12
industry want to support our dollar dependence. We want to get people's.

195
00:21:54,12 --> 00:22:00,3
Legal things sort of money goes back and forth. As our soul says. This is how we want to change society.

196
00:22:00,88 --> 00:22:08,84
Now what has had to happen is we're going to have to take this. I've been. All money. And redirected completely.

197
00:22:09,1 --> 00:22:14,36
We're going to have to get a lot of the things that are. Earth negative. And put it into things. Of earth positive.

198
00:22:14,36 --> 00:22:20,2
And it's a very simple process that just means. Not put into petro and the chemical companies first.

199
00:22:20,2 --> 00:22:23,66
And allow one farmer to go broke for a million bucks to the bank.

200
00:22:23,66 --> 00:22:27,28
On a bit of land that he's poisoning and a soul goes into melbourne into the air.

201
00:22:27,28 --> 00:22:35,62
You know we have to get a thousand people working with their hands. And there are still people in government saying.

202
00:22:35,62 --> 00:22:39,33
You can't get away with that though unless of course you want to do it.

203
00:22:39,33 --> 00:22:43,29
Because they don't know what you don't put a barrier there saying that land going to cost you fifty thousand bucks.

204
00:22:43,93 --> 00:22:50,08
You know. It's going back to the land that's what all it was all about the twenty first century to me.

205
00:22:50,08 --> 00:22:53,12
It's going to be mushy mcluhan's global village.

206
00:22:53,12 --> 00:22:57,49
And you can now live on the land with a fax machine and you can work a solo in brothers in new york.

207
00:22:57,49 --> 00:23:03,91
You don't have to live in a city anymore. You know. And therefore we can get away from the dichotomy between.

208
00:23:03,91 --> 00:23:06,14
The city and the rural land.

209
00:23:06,14 --> 00:23:13,39
And we actually can saying people are merging in and become the caretaker society where we believe that the third why.

210
00:23:13,39 --> 00:23:19,32
That toffler right about. Is actually. It started you know.

211
00:23:19,32 --> 00:23:26,6
Industrialised nation is dead it's just going to take a while for it. Wake up to that fact and lay down and get buried.

212
00:23:26,91 --> 00:23:36,13
But industrialized nation is finished and the new tribe or the new. Village. Is there. Works and space.

213
00:23:36,13 --> 00:23:42,36
It's a many people got. We've all got telephones you know it. Couple of years ago.

214
00:23:42,36 --> 00:23:48,45
Before we got our strata tight we couldn't afford to if they wanted eighteen hundred dollars to put one in the running

215
00:23:48,45 --> 00:23:55,26
man. We said as we got the strada. Four hundred dollars. You know. And it was ridiculous isn't it. We got.

216
00:23:55,26 --> 00:24:09,23
We've got a system of government now. That allows us to get money from the taxpayer. To drive. A car. Built in japan.

217
00:24:09,23 --> 00:24:17,93
With oil. Harvested in saudi arabia. To buy the vegetables. Grown either ipswich or in thailand.

218
00:24:17,93 --> 00:24:22,57
And we were wondering why report that record because we don't make our own cups.

219
00:24:22,63 --> 00:24:28,85
We all make our own shirts we don't we don't grow our own foods. And the essence to me.

220
00:24:28,85 --> 00:24:32,4
The answers are here it's just that. This is only a microcosm.

221
00:24:32,4 --> 00:24:37,23
Does not have to be translate this whole valley here when you go back to lose more.

222
00:24:37,23 --> 00:24:40,95
As you just get down off the hill on to the flats down there.

223
00:24:40,95 --> 00:24:51,2
Those flats in the thirty's used to provide sydney and melbourne with onions and christ knows what else. To mana. Yeah.

224
00:24:51,2 --> 00:24:59,77
There's nothing there now that. Cloven hoofed down trodden bloody attics. That.

225
00:24:59,77 --> 00:25:06,99
You look at it it's a senate bill strip. They desperately need it. And we need.

226
00:25:06,99 --> 00:25:14,00
If we're going to repair the hours arm by using the oxygen then it should be against the world law for anybody else to

227
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:21,46
cut down the solitary bloody tree unless it's a pine tree or slash park in tree because they're the only thing.

228
00:25:21,46 --> 00:25:25,84
Trees that don't do and use you. And the real obscenity is not even.

229
00:25:25,84 --> 00:25:31,49
The moron who cuts down that tree on the on the slope. Because you want to get more grass to his cow.

230
00:25:31,49 --> 00:25:37,63
The real obscenity is debt. Our whole system pays for that knowledge and actually obstruct the opposite yes.

231
00:25:37,63 --> 00:25:45,06
Because the power has been flowing into exactly that group. And so you're getting a situation where literally.

232
00:25:45,06 --> 00:25:51,11
Your assets are being stripped day in day out. On taxpayers' money. Still today.

233
00:25:51,99 --> 00:25:59,2
Well a tree today you know to go and buy a tree today. Of the forestry. Cus you about twenty five bucks.

234
00:25:59,2 --> 00:26:05,8
Is a tree is being growing for something like seventy bloody year. It's true value should be ran.

235
00:26:06,23 --> 00:26:13,45
Three or four hundred bucks. John if i would be in charge of the prime minister's department one day.

236
00:26:13,45 --> 00:26:20,6
I would do the following. I would say this land is worth so much. After you rip the trays out the.

237
00:26:20,6 --> 00:26:26,26
Erode the soil after thirty years it's worth that much will cost that much to really have been a tight and.

238
00:26:26,26 --> 00:26:30,46
For this is your taxation vice. Just like in china they'll say you have your second cube.

239
00:26:30,46 --> 00:26:32,15
You'll you actually go down a living standard.

240
00:26:32,81 --> 00:26:37,16
So it's not fair to allow a man to sell a cow for three for one of bucks.

241
00:26:37,16 --> 00:26:42,7
When in fact the taxpayer ten years from now must rehabilitate atlanta. Because he didn't own that soil.

242
00:26:42,7 --> 00:26:49,86
He just and this is very important ownership all you own is the rights to can't take an income but. A bit of land.

243
00:26:49,86 --> 00:26:54,55
During your life. All right and if you don't have some. Some clothes you can give your kid.

244
00:26:54,55 --> 00:26:59,88
So be it or be some other thing but you don't own the land you don't own soil that is owned by the government.

245
00:26:59,88 --> 00:27:05,06
All the minerals and data on what the government of arizona the government the only had the right to use.

246
00:27:05,06 --> 00:27:11,74
And therefore conventional economics betrays the future generation. Because it says. Rick rick rick rick rick rip.

247
00:27:11,74 --> 00:27:19,21
Pretty my own pocket. And off i go to england or whatever i want in my when roz kelly. Snatch back this.

248
00:27:20,74 --> 00:27:30,2
Training package for primary school. That said. It told the truth. Than our current practices are destroying the earth.

249
00:27:30,2 --> 00:27:37,24
And the farming lobby is so bloody strong in this country that that thing was ready to go out to the schools.

250
00:27:37,24 --> 00:27:42,34
And they got it stopped. I find it scandalous i don't want the truth. To be known.

251
00:27:42,34 --> 00:27:48,84
But i think most young children today. Know what's going on.

252
00:27:48,84 --> 00:27:57,24
I think the primary school teachers are doing a tremendous job with regards to the environment problems.

253
00:27:58,1 --> 00:28:02,54
I don't know whether that's having any effect on the way kids behave with little.

254
00:28:02,54 --> 00:28:08,83
And all that because i don't have kids around here are generally. Pretty good. Because if any adult.

255
00:28:08,83 --> 00:28:20,64
Sees a child drop a piece of litter. They say that up. Thank you very much indeed a thanks or.

256
00:28:20,64 --> 00:28:23,68
Would you like a cup of tea.
