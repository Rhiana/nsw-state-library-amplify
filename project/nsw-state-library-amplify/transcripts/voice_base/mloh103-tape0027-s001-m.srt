1
00:00:13,25 --> 00:00:22,35
Again a lot. I should explain it a bit like this. I'm an economist and a researcher and.

2
00:00:22,35 --> 00:00:29,77
I know what you can do with statistics. Statistics you use to package different face.

3
00:00:29,77 --> 00:00:34,26
And you can do it any way you want to so you can look at bill and cliff as a village.

4
00:00:34,26 --> 00:00:42,57
And you can brush it with the tar. Of welfare dependency and say look this cost the taxpayer so much money.

5
00:00:42,57 --> 00:00:45,02
And it is being done at the same time.

6
00:00:45,02 --> 00:00:52,14
That look at the other side the reason why the word welfare dependency here was it was created by systematically

7
00:00:52,14 --> 00:01:00,73
withdrawing any asset we had. Into local council conditions including five million dollar. Bridges.

8
00:01:00,73 --> 00:01:01,98
Hundred fifty thousand dollars.

9
00:01:01,98 --> 00:01:07,58
Roads and this and the amount of cost so we never could build a commercial infrastructure that was denied.

10
00:01:07,58 --> 00:01:13,16
Secondly even if it wouldn't have taken place. You must value.

11
00:01:13,16 --> 00:01:19,81
A model that can make out a one hundred thousand dollar property. A ten million dollar property within ten years time.

12
00:01:19,81 --> 00:01:22,81
Each and every individual who had no money ten years ago.

13
00:01:22,81 --> 00:01:29,92
Now has got a home worth fifty sixty seventy thousand dollars in income but by the banking system. We changed.

14
00:01:29,92 --> 00:01:36,25
Property. As john said it could not support one farmer family. Could not so we had to walk off the land.

15
00:01:36,25 --> 00:01:44,37
And now it's supporting eighty families and in time. Well one. That adds to the national assets. Ten million bucks.

16
00:01:44,37 --> 00:01:50,97
Which is a lot more than distillate ever got into so security receipts and secondly it actually.

17
00:01:50,97 --> 00:01:56,5
Just a very thing that. Everybody's talking about now which is. Ecologically sustainable development.

18
00:01:56,5 --> 00:02:02,17
You're nurtured the earth brought in poison it. You take control of your own life or and having it rules. It.

19
00:02:02,17 --> 00:02:10,68
You produce your own products to import them. And you feed the community values are they a people hear more.

20
00:02:10,68 --> 00:02:18,12
By more of their own. Become less dependent on exports. Less depend on the motor car and.

21
00:02:18,12 --> 00:02:25,77
Bring tourist dollars in by sharing. Other people how to do this. This is what.

22
00:02:25,77 --> 00:02:36,25
Stage in this latest deal is all about now we've gone for and we've gone for a cow with. Processed food dried food.

23
00:02:36,25 --> 00:02:38,25
From nursery. At a nursery.

24
00:02:38,25 --> 00:02:40,34
And then we're going for some sort of eco tours

25
00:02:40,34 --> 00:02:45,66
and these other things that the infrastructure that will make it worthwhile for tourists to come here

26
00:02:45,66 --> 00:02:52,48
and have a look at. Buddy year two thousand and. It will be very very difficult. To buy into berlin cliffs.

27
00:02:52,48 --> 00:02:56,98
Very difficult it will be family plots and they want to leave the family to get valuable.

28
00:02:57,53 --> 00:03:03,96
It will be a training institute for this lifestyle. And will attract people who are right around the world.

29
00:03:03,96 --> 00:03:11,28
Because we offer here now. All the things that we were dreaming about and you still dream about in the cities.

30
00:03:11,28 --> 00:03:18,22
Which is to have a fresh air you have no payments to degrade you don't pollute the degree. You have a you grow.

31
00:03:18,22 --> 00:03:23,87
Beautiful foods. And you know how to do the healing arts and so on.

32
00:03:23,87 --> 00:03:30,85
So that process of ecotourism is taking place now it's a regional thing we started something which is catching fire

33
00:03:30,85 --> 00:03:34,39
regionally now and it's going to into nimbin as well.

34
00:03:34,39 --> 00:03:42,35
It is a topic which needs discussion at length because the community itself must put values on how much they will sell

35
00:03:42,35 --> 00:03:45,71
out to the great god mammon in order to become independent right now.

36
00:03:45,71 --> 00:03:53,77
We are already depend on the system as a as a lifestyle. In fact. Anything wrong with dollar couriers thing.

37
00:03:53,91 --> 00:04:01,13
It is that it's been supported to the point that it is weak at the knees it can work on a more totally.

38
00:04:01,13 --> 00:04:09,36
So secure dependence and to have a true philosophy for the next century and we hope an eclipse is in fact.

39
00:04:09,36 --> 00:04:14,24
A leading part of days. It must. Financially independent.

40
00:04:14,24 --> 00:04:31,57
You've got a role to get your side of the river you can't keep on saying. Poor theremin. Yeah. Yeah. Well i know.

41
00:04:31,57 --> 00:04:43,73
Well that that has happened. And there are still a few private place. Ok. Sure.

42
00:04:43,73 --> 00:04:52,64
Strata title it didn't really improve people's chances of making more money it just made it easier for people to buy.

43
00:04:52,64 --> 00:04:59,81
Because on a strata title they could get a law. Whereas on a multiple occupancy you couldn't on a multiple occupancy.

44
00:04:59,99 --> 00:05:07,44
Let's say a house that's for sale here for id grand and will probably be sold very quickly.

45
00:05:07,44 --> 00:05:12,94
On a multiple occupancy you might be lucky and get twenty four.

46
00:05:12,94 --> 00:05:16,9
Because you can't borrow money on the strength that much rather come get two or three.

47
00:05:17,11 --> 00:05:21,18
Yes you would just be very lucky to get any sort of money back.

48
00:05:21,18 --> 00:05:28,14
Well that was one of the when we had to go for the strata title. A lot of people didn't want that. You know.

49
00:05:28,43 --> 00:05:37,42
And we had to look at all that was about five alternatives that we had to study and. The strata title came out.

50
00:05:37,42 --> 00:05:44,36
As the winner. Now we knew that the offshoot of that immediately was a lot more rights because we'd have to pay.

51
00:05:44,36 --> 00:05:53,05
Individual rights to lose more council. As well as our internal levees. So a lot of people didn't want it.

52
00:05:53,05 --> 00:06:00,8
But it was the only way. And one of the ups of that is the forty one of the multitude of reasons.

53
00:06:00,8 --> 00:06:08,21
People have to move away. They can get as much. They can get enough money to probably set themselves up somewhere else.

54
00:06:08,21 --> 00:06:17,24
After a fashion rather than. Have to walk out with nothing. So distraught as we're good in that way.

55
00:06:17,24 --> 00:06:22,62
It has allowed people to take a capital investment. But the ones who want to sell.

56
00:06:24,2 --> 00:06:32,2
We really want them to sell and maybe somebody else comes in who doesn't want to sell. Generally people in malls or.

57
00:06:32,2 --> 00:06:35,93
In places like berlin for do not want to hang on to lifestyle.

58
00:06:35,93 --> 00:06:41,9
Because very little outside their you can compare it with but.

59
00:06:41,9 --> 00:06:44,46
You've got to recognize something must have mainstream values

60
00:06:44,46 --> 00:06:52,92
and i think one of the things that we're particularly interested in is to build a bridge between mainstream

61
00:06:52,92 --> 00:06:56,23
and turn it is. Because we've got to integrate.

62
00:06:56,23 --> 00:07:02,96
Where once all we are male and female inside you know you have you and yang. Fire and water. It's.

63
00:07:02,96 --> 00:07:08,8
That that capitalism communism duality must go all the must be a bridge builder and that bridge.

64
00:07:08,8 --> 00:07:14,19
Means that your average person can actually. Attain.

65
00:07:14,19 --> 00:07:21,08
The lifestyle of society now or claim to be ecologically sustainable. Yet.

66
00:07:21,08 --> 00:07:24,5
And to do that you must have a model that allows you to do so

67
00:07:24,5 --> 00:07:27,43
and one of the things i like to make clear about bill implicit is when you listen to it

68
00:07:27,43 --> 00:07:33,12
when this in to ourself talking it seems like an enclave of a club almost how do you get in.

69
00:07:33,12 --> 00:07:40,67
How do you keep things like this not true. You come in and you go like in any order village it is no.

70
00:07:40,67 --> 00:07:46,77
You don't know everybody on the property. Diverse people who are. Speculators who never are here.

71
00:07:47,07 --> 00:07:51,17
There is people who are active committee members who had every meeting douras. Hermits.

72
00:07:51,17 --> 00:07:56,78
There are people who work in town and don't play to look much at the village. And it's easy to get in and out.

73
00:07:56,78 --> 00:08:03,22
And and and that sense to bridge is important because if you tell the average person in the city.

74
00:08:03,22 --> 00:08:07,35
The world's falling apart. The bombs about to drop the financial system about to collapse.

75
00:08:07,35 --> 00:08:11,74
Blah blah blah all the whole thing isn't going to do you know. There's no good. You can't do more you can't.

76
00:08:11,94 --> 00:08:16,97
On that beach anymore. And you say what's your alternative well the multiple occupancy.

77
00:08:16,97 --> 00:08:22,26
You got no rotch can get a homeowner's grand can resell the place. And you have local council fighting you.

78
00:08:22,26 --> 00:08:28,39
So building cliffs was set up. To say to the mainstream person. Yes you can do it.

79
00:08:28,39 --> 00:08:34,13
You've got the safety of private property. You have all the benefits of a socially conscious infrastructure.

80
00:08:35,41 --> 00:08:51,64
So this whole life. Cried. You laugh. Middle class had no idea i think that that kind of.

81
00:08:51,64 --> 00:09:00,24
You know that's a bit of nimbin hippy bullshit. That everyone around toed winter i know you've been around yeah ok..

82
00:08:59,07 --> 00:09:05,35
I've got a t.v. I don't watch it all the time but i like to play the odd video. We like to drink.

83
00:09:05,35 --> 00:09:09,18
Fruit juice we've got a mixer. We've got three panels out there.

84
00:09:09,78 --> 00:09:15,35
I came here where i'd had a many lives before i came here.

85
00:09:15,35 --> 00:09:20,78
In one nine hundred seventy five i was earning thirty two thousand dollars a year as a training officer.

86
00:09:20,78 --> 00:09:28,12
I had a bit of break. It ran out rapidly. But you know we've got a few solar panels but.

87
00:09:28,12 --> 00:09:37,17
There's no one here who hasn't got one tower panel. When i came when we landed here. Power source.

88
00:09:37,17 --> 00:09:41,87
Was our car battery which i carried into the house and ruined a hundred to read indian.

89
00:09:41,87 --> 00:09:46,98
Beautiful indian muslim and then i got two car batteries wow.

90
00:09:46,98 --> 00:09:53,93
Oh i had one in the car and man in the house not yet the james and once a week. Nevertheless it's a bit of hannele.

91
00:09:53,93 --> 00:10:05,47
Then to families. And stuff. But john. It was. Because we live like this it does not mean to say that.

92
00:10:05,47 --> 00:10:11,74
There are certain things. These in technology that we don't one. I'm not afraid of technology.

93
00:10:12,14 --> 00:10:19,55
I love it if it's appropriate. I'm not drawing. It doesn't take me four barrels of coal.

94
00:10:19,55 --> 00:10:30,24
To fire up a bloody great pass to boil a cup of water in a day or something really interesting get a writ of death.

95
00:10:30,24 --> 00:10:38,63
And that is. If mainstream. Isn't at the answers. It has to be didn't live like a q. It. You know that. Ok you say.

96
00:10:38,63 --> 00:10:41,26
I've got to say this is just as wrong.

97
00:10:41,81 --> 00:10:46,34
Now i'm not knocking will to block you've been saved because they have been a life raft for many people

98
00:10:46,34 --> 00:10:54,56
and still are and still there will be. And as i said i know they've got their place. But as a social experiment.

99
00:10:54,56 --> 00:11:02,28
It is essentially flawed. And the reason why. Communism is breaking down in russia.

100
00:11:02,28 --> 00:11:06,99
Is because that old communist model of common ownership. Just doesn't work.

101
00:11:07,94 --> 00:11:13,44
I'm not saying that it couldn't work in some idealist society. But in the here and now. On this earth.

102
00:11:13,44 --> 00:11:20,18
It just doesn't work because there are some people who will steal who will obstruct who will be too paranoid to

103
00:11:20,18 --> 00:11:25,89
participate. It falls apart is fall apart and seychelle to fall apart and melts land it fall apart and russia.

104
00:11:25,89 --> 00:11:27,22
It's fall apart and in then.

105
00:11:28,04 --> 00:11:34,13
Now it may well fall apart because i thought i was meant to push a good repartee along the good ones to collection.

106
00:11:34,13 --> 00:11:41,24
But basically you do need some of that what you said was debt. Gentrifying establishment feeling.

107
00:11:41,24 --> 00:11:49,4
We all need to have a base and i myself find. Private property. I have a problem with that notion.

108
00:11:49,4 --> 00:11:55,61
I do believe in a lifelong lease of ownership and that's how i regard. Our tour and startle.

109
00:11:55,61 --> 00:11:58,14
I don't know it's not like that but that's how i regard it.

110
00:11:58,14 --> 00:12:05,00
We were originally set up here to lease delenn from ourselves and when we die. It goes back to the community. You know.

111
00:12:05,5 --> 00:12:11,74
But that's not the system we work on but we're approximating it closely. There is nothing wrong.

112
00:12:11,94 --> 00:12:18,82
In fact it is very necessary. To find that bridge between where you say no this is mine.

113
00:12:18,82 --> 00:12:26,91
And where you say no i'm going to share here and. Mainstream society. Is overly too much in a head trip.

114
00:12:26,91 --> 00:12:30,26
They get older right answers but no one can actually do without the fridge.

115
00:12:30,26 --> 00:12:34,5
And no one can do without the infrastructure. So we flush our problems down the toilet.

116
00:12:34,5 --> 00:12:40,95
And we just sayen wish for a better world. If you go to the multiple occupancies scene.

117
00:12:40,95 --> 00:12:43,14
You actually live the ideal lifestyle.

118
00:12:43,59 --> 00:12:51,03
But you can never actually said has fired those few basic needs that are coming up.

119
00:12:51,03 --> 00:12:56,11
Every once in a while like you're dirt poor and your teeth fall apart on you or your marriage children part

120
00:12:56,11 --> 00:13:00,17
and you can't sell your house and you're stuck. So you need an interim. Thing.

121
00:13:00,17 --> 00:13:07,85
Where you have all the right philosophies that curry's came up with at the same time enough bite size of society at

122
00:13:07,85 --> 00:13:16,72
large enough sense that it actually works on a human level as well. And i think that's what we've got.

123
00:13:16,72 --> 00:13:26,15
I think we we're not saying we are the ultimate. We are a stepping stone from that. One way street. To nowhere.

124
00:13:26,15 --> 00:13:35,17
The commune. You see that's what they try to do to us. They try to shut down a one way street.

125
00:13:35,17 --> 00:13:44,65
And that's when we said no. And when i say that i'm not being derogatory about the places or the people.

126
00:13:44,65 --> 00:13:55,29
They came at that time in the us. But they didn't spread. You know so really it was a cocoon trip.

127
00:13:56,00 --> 00:14:04,87
Now we believe that the time is coming. Where we're going to have to spread. And we believe there will be places.

128
00:14:04,87 --> 00:14:11,74
For like ours. You see my greatest dream is to see don a sixty year massacre of.

129
00:14:12,19 --> 00:14:20,03
Is that took place through this big scrub. I would like to see a hundred year project. Say.

130
00:14:20,03 --> 00:14:30,09
To read green the big scrub and. It would be done by the young guy who can do the work. It could involve kinda guy.

131
00:14:30,09 --> 00:14:37,57
In and primary school through secondary schools and through our universities. It could.

132
00:14:37,57 --> 00:14:46,78
Within ten years it would be such a major tourist attraction. That it would fund itself. Kids have got nothing to do.

133
00:14:46,78 --> 00:14:53,89
Give them something to take them to the sunlight. And this. You were this lane.

134
00:14:53,89 --> 00:15:03,21
For five years and replant it gives you the right to live on that. For as long as you live.

135
00:15:03,51 --> 00:15:10,12
This is what we've got to do. And we've got to do it in a massive. Way and this big scrub area here.

136
00:15:10,12 --> 00:15:21,25
Would be the ideal place to start. It would involve. Every religion every little town could participate.

137
00:15:21,25 --> 00:15:30,79
And put their youth to work. But sell it to them and make it as popular as it is him in is in berkeley and you know.

138
00:15:30,79 --> 00:15:37,66
Make them out of skinheads. The tree paintings. So we've got to let them go there.

139
00:15:37,66 --> 00:15:46,28
Set them up with cameras let them have their music. Let them have a smoke and if they wanted. Not too much alcohol.

140
00:15:46,28 --> 00:15:52,11
Like alcohol or who. I do see. Both.

141
00:15:52,11 --> 00:16:00,00
Very very clearly a city the program that mainstream when you live in a place like this.

142
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:03,75
When you have people you saw a year or two ago.

143
00:16:03,75 --> 00:16:07,96
Killing each other for the right to sleep in a public toilet in reality.

144
00:16:07,96 --> 00:16:16,31
Kicked to death by a teenage girl for the right to sleep in a two hour. Our society. Actually creates. All this angst.

145
00:16:16,31 --> 00:16:23,1
On the television you're being told that the ozone layer is falling apart and of. Job prospects and milk.

146
00:16:23,1 --> 00:16:28,51
And yet you're being caged into this system. Close from close to collapse because when you want to go out.

147
00:16:28,51 --> 00:16:36,3
You can buy the land. All the great. Revolutions around the world. All of them have been about ownership of land.

148
00:16:36,3 --> 00:16:43,67
Make no mistake about it. Now to too much about land. The french revolution. Land it's all about land. And the land.

149
00:16:43,67 --> 00:16:52,39
In australia today. It's menage to i should say mismanaged to. Old world concepts that are in essence saying.

150
00:16:52,39 --> 00:17:01,57
The local inhabitant. Has no right to exist he's a supplement and. The local resources are get to be exploited.

151
00:17:02,17 --> 00:17:08,66
We're now shifting into the twenty first century where we're saying expectation is over. Roads are in.

152
00:17:08,66 --> 00:17:15,62
Timbers are made in the cabinets. Now we actually have to face a tree living here. We've got to change.

153
00:17:15,62 --> 00:17:22,51
European dominated. Australian culture. To some extent what ever it is. Into a truly local culture.

154
00:17:22,51 --> 00:17:26,42
And it's for that reason that when we built the model for. Bill and cliff.

155
00:17:26,42 --> 00:17:32,61
Emotionally within ourselves we borrowed a lot from not only get rid you called it off the pacific islander culture

156
00:17:32,61 --> 00:17:35,17
and niman and on a kind of untenable yeah.

157
00:17:35,17 --> 00:17:40,75
And it's an interesting thing about this level of communism as to how deep you should go. Before you reach equity.

158
00:17:40,75 --> 00:17:43,37
When you go to.

159
00:17:43,37 --> 00:17:48,36
Original and have it and the lifestyle which are living today still in cape york and you know everywhere.

160
00:17:49,73 --> 00:17:52,3
There is no one can.

161
00:17:52,3 --> 00:17:58,39
Commoners and there is a chief who holds a certain large amount of land in trust for the population.

162
00:17:58,39 --> 00:18:04,41
So when someone gets married. You get a bit of land. There is systems of ownership. Even operating on that level.

163
00:18:06,22 --> 00:18:11,36
So we have the same systems here we must create the same systems here not what you say in the way belongs to everybody

164
00:18:11,36 --> 00:18:20,58
and. He has been. The enemy from within. For us. A druid hard to deal with because i said to people out of three.

165
00:18:20,58 --> 00:18:22,42
Our real problem.

166
00:18:22,42 --> 00:18:28,01
On the outside has been overbearing system of the inside had to have been there were true thinkers who want to be left

167
00:18:28,01 --> 00:18:31,15
alone you know one of the anarchists.

168
00:18:31,15 --> 00:18:37,7
Can make more trouble than twenty one is ready and you know that i've always been a bit ikea's to myself.

169
00:18:37,7 --> 00:18:47,88
So i could understand what you have to do you have to present the bill and clear. Whatever happens.

170
00:18:47,88 --> 00:18:50,28
You have to go to the residence me

171
00:18:50,28 --> 00:18:58,99
and you just if you want something to happen you just have to present a better case than the ones who don't want to

172
00:18:58,99 --> 00:19:10,24
hear. It really is a low level democracy. We've got about seventy four families here.

173
00:19:10,24 --> 00:19:16,53
We have a residence meeting once a month. The residents.

174
00:19:16,53 --> 00:19:24,76
Make all the decisions about everything that meeting is usually attended by about ten. Residents.

175
00:19:24,76 --> 00:19:32,15
A core group who are always there and odd ones who flock in because there might be a topic. From there.

176
00:19:32,15 --> 00:19:39,68
So it's basically it's a business meeting. And it should be transplanted into suburban australia.

177
00:19:39,68 --> 00:19:45,02
A church and of course a church. Of course through empowering neighborhood you've got to start talking.

178
00:19:45,02 --> 00:19:48,02
And if you have people running around your neighborhood that are not doing anything.

179
00:19:48,71 --> 00:19:53,87
Give them a job replanting cleaning the sidewalks up helping the old lady with her or her meal.

180
00:19:54,31 --> 00:20:00,61
So we've come so bloody big in our system we forgotten about the little people and really once you start talking.

181
00:20:00,61 --> 00:20:04,71
No matter how difficult that process is wonderful things happen on i go.

182
00:20:04,71 --> 00:20:14,44
You know where the issues are contentious debate can get pretty heated. But if nothing else. We respect the chair.

183
00:20:17,78 --> 00:20:23,48
I think in all the table years i've ever been here i've already attended one meeting where the chair couldn't control

184
00:20:23,48 --> 00:20:39,87
to me and that was a little nasty. Politics. A pretty good. People who lobby. Get things done.

185
00:20:39,87 --> 00:20:55,5
But if the majority of people don't think it's a good idea it doesn't get it. Were the acquired ideas twenty years ago.

186
00:20:55,5 --> 00:21:08,4
You know couch mint came to new members and really was a way. He. He asked the question. If not one. Twenty five times.

187
00:21:08,4 --> 00:21:17,5
He said. But what happened to all the ideals all these it. Young hippies are shy. You're all middle age.

188
00:21:17,5 --> 00:21:23,01
You showed me any group of people in society you haven't changed in the last twenty years

189
00:21:23,01 --> 00:21:32,76
and i'll say yes it's a graveyard. Everybody changes. Everybody. I also want to point out that that.

190
00:21:32,76 --> 00:21:40,29
The aquarian ideal. Never was owned by newman. It was owned by. Everybody.

191
00:21:40,29 --> 00:21:47,6
And it was in poland it was in amsterdam and was in california it was here.

192
00:21:47,6 --> 00:21:54,13
We just made one shrine for you christ first of all nine hundred seventy three which allowed us trillions to have one

193
00:21:54,13 --> 00:22:00,98
place to go to what it could sit and think about just wonderful phenomena that you actually are peaceful and organic

194
00:22:00,98 --> 00:22:06,5
and sharing and so on and none of this is completely and all of us try to be a little bit.

195
00:22:06,5 --> 00:22:11,74
So i see aquarius now everywhere to me when i look at the signing. It's very green. All.

196
00:22:12,04 --> 00:22:15,89
Both philosophies which were expanded seventy three are now everywhere.

197
00:22:15,89 --> 00:22:16,79
And i can be here

198
00:22:16,79 --> 00:22:21,13
and happily talk about aquarius even though i wasn't here nine hundred seventy three i was in california i didn't come

199
00:22:21,13 --> 00:22:28,33
here until seventy nine and. Yet i feel the same philosophy that i share with all the other ones that feeling that.

200
00:22:28,33 --> 00:22:33,00
We are part of sponsible for the planet. And we optimistic one do something about it.

201
00:22:33,00 --> 00:22:41,49
And with that ice i realized that within the bureaucracy from cambridge to perth sane people are supposed to put it in

202
00:22:41,49 --> 00:22:47,68
a nutshell for me. The essence of the twenty years.

203
00:22:47,68 --> 00:22:59,87
Is in the development of what you see when you drive around this valley. That's the aquarian to me is living. Strong.

204
00:22:59,87 --> 00:23:05,67
Gratings gaining strength every day more and more people putting trees in more

205
00:23:05,67 --> 00:23:13,56
and more people concerned about environmental issues. More and more people writing letters about matters.

206
00:23:13,56 --> 00:23:20,68
And people get involved in the things that we have the day we didn't realize just what the problems were there in to

207
00:23:20,68 --> 00:23:27,62
what we know now. We have a group of people here are very conscious of what's going on in the world.

208
00:23:27,62 --> 00:23:34,53
I think that's my thing what i would have said. Well i'm not in seventy three years or twenty years hence now.

209
00:23:34,53 --> 00:23:41,15
Yeah a man comes of age just twenty one days say orcon voted eighteen. I believe ukraine movement. Is getting of.

210
00:23:41,15 --> 00:23:46,49
A good just getting towards its military stage. It's missionary stage you probably go out and.

211
00:23:46,49 --> 00:23:53,28
And want to change the world for a little while and settle down and maybe ten years time. And at that time it becomes.

212
00:23:53,28 --> 00:24:02,7
Mature philosophy. I don't quite i don't think. The i think the philosophy in fact is stretched from. Earth's.

213
00:24:02,7 --> 00:24:07,05
Children who go and sit in the forest and climb up. Powell's probably.

214
00:24:07,05 --> 00:24:11,74
To the other end of the spectrum which would probably be in the likes of a few.

215
00:24:11,87 --> 00:24:23,46
Other cities around but we're not going to you if no one knows who we are so they can..

216
00:24:17,00 --> 00:24:24,48
Well he says got to take the step on. From oz. I'm hoping it's a d. Devolution.

217
00:24:24,48 --> 00:24:30,15
I would i would like to see now is that we have set this up. This can be done.

218
00:24:30,15 --> 00:24:36,35
And we all know that the next one should be taking a bunch of young employed people out there and. Getting the desert.

219
00:24:36,35 --> 00:24:42,46
To give for you it's just to get here the situation of debt. When you come of age.

220
00:24:42,46 --> 00:24:49,05
In the pacific islands right off our front door here and man gets presented on marriage.

221
00:24:49,05 --> 00:24:57,93
And he selected a partner with a house and a plot of land. That is that is an asset he gets. We are in our society.

222
00:24:57,93 --> 00:25:04,37
Tell people you've got to earn it all from the beginning. And that creates poverty.

223
00:25:04,37 --> 00:25:11,52
So it is a really good thing to look at our own processes and saying what are we really doing.

224
00:25:11,52 --> 00:25:22,79
With with our world while. In fact why is the establishment. In effect. Trying to. Well. Choke the life out of.

225
00:25:22,79 --> 00:25:30,83
One of the very few places. That actually tries to do what it. What we all know ought to be done.

226
00:25:30,83 --> 00:25:35,83
However now we've said a lot of things about the lismore city council.

227
00:25:35,83 --> 00:25:42,7
And i'd like to say one more thing and this is not by way of apology because what we've said has been absolutely true.

228
00:25:42,7 --> 00:25:50,43
One individual. Drove us to distraction financially and emotionally in all sorts of way.

229
00:25:50,43 --> 00:25:58,36
And he was allowed to do that by many of the med but. Three mayors ago.

230
00:25:58,36 --> 00:26:06,89
We've gone through about seven men and five planners and christ knows how many engineers at all that.

231
00:26:06,89 --> 00:26:17,35
Three minutes ago. We struck up a report with bob's. Who is in there. That time. And bob put us on the agenda.

232
00:26:17,35 --> 00:26:22,05
And for that. We're very grateful to him as an individual.

233
00:26:22,05 --> 00:26:28,26
Since then we've also had a lot of support from the past man.

234
00:26:28,26 --> 00:26:38,42
And the crew and of our resident mayor john crowther that howell frederick's. So i really. In fact.

235
00:26:38,42 --> 00:26:45,18
What they did to is early in the piece and ripped all our money off. In the end. They came good.

236
00:26:45,18 --> 00:26:49,78
And given all that i was to get some more money. In fact. Fact and.

237
00:26:49,78 --> 00:26:53,69
Should be said we when you reflect on that on the history.

238
00:26:53,69 --> 00:27:00,35
You tend to get stuck and the big learning experience in the big planes and so on. It shouldn't be forgotten that.

239
00:27:00,35 --> 00:27:05,98
Over the last few years we've become very effective in networking throughout the value layers of government.

240
00:27:05,98 --> 00:27:10,28
And we found very good responsiveness denner of what's all the messages.

241
00:27:10,28 --> 00:27:15,5
About why we're doing what we're doing are now understood by the average. Average bureaucrat.

242
00:27:15,5 --> 00:27:17,4
And there are some visionaries when state local

243
00:27:17,4 --> 00:27:26,74
or federal government to have really help in this along yet said yeah that must be said it's about did you do any other

244
00:27:26,74 --> 00:27:45,88
kind of stuff you'd like to talk about. Yeah well yeah i know. They well they were all.

245
00:27:45,88 --> 00:27:50,31
They were all the ones that are sorry. I didn't say they were the.

246
00:27:50,31 --> 00:27:56,96
You couldn't repeat our team and to repeat the question. Sorry. Courteous movement. Was a bit elitist.

247
00:27:56,96 --> 00:28:00,79
Because there is such a thing as a trickle down theory.

248
00:28:00,79 --> 00:28:07,42
And you also find that the ones who had the notion the students did not were not the people who actually by

249
00:28:07,42 --> 00:28:11,74
and large did. The telling of the story with their hands.

250
00:28:11,78 --> 00:28:22,5
I think one of the nice thing that has come from aquarius one of the real growth. Things..

251
00:28:17,79 --> 00:28:24,91
Is that has become a universal movement. What i wanted by the ph d. Or what i want to add more humble.

252
00:28:24,91 --> 00:28:29,59
Occasional qualifications. What do you are a great debater or buddy you were a silent type.

253
00:28:29,59 --> 00:28:36,38
What you were a mechanic over the. You know a nurseryman. It is right throughout the whole last yes.

254
00:28:36,38 --> 00:28:43,62
The thing started with the intellectuals just like the nine hundred sixty eight revolution in paris. Also as a student.

255
00:28:43,62 --> 00:28:49,73
Thing. You know that happens with students. But then it comes down. That's where you pay students for you know.

256
00:28:49,73 --> 00:28:50,89
What do you think about lawyer.

257
00:28:51,98 --> 00:28:54,81
I want to do doing nowadays in ninety three or what are you doing now

258
00:28:54,81 --> 00:29:00,75
and i don't do much demonstrating well my daughter is too bloody busy going to work to support herself.

259
00:29:00,75 --> 00:29:14,96
So you can go successful i actually frightened a lot of work that. All pretty well.

260
00:29:14,96 --> 00:29:21,68
I tell you how we moved in here and my daughter was the first kid from here to get on the school bus.

261
00:29:21,68 --> 00:29:29,61
And they used to leave iraq and seats around. And she had a very hard time.

262
00:29:29,61 --> 00:29:37,18
For the first few months until she started learning a little bit stick around and telling few home truths.

263
00:29:37,18 --> 00:29:43,25
However by the end of her first year at school she had started to move into leadership roles

264
00:29:43,25 --> 00:29:51,86
and was being sent away on. Different leadership courses or. She's always been an excellent student.

265
00:29:51,86 --> 00:29:57,36
And she's very motivated. Self-motivated because the university trip.

266
00:29:57,45 --> 00:30:11,74
She has known since she was twelve that we couldn't afford to support. So in grade ten. She was the lions use of the.

267
00:30:12,17 --> 00:30:21,78
And she did. More than any other. There's a big college. Arrives. And it's got the. Choice kids from all of them.

268
00:30:21,78 --> 00:30:27,96
So there was a and for the other kids from this other college that she went through three of them.

269
00:30:27,96 --> 00:30:44,25
She got the one from the state level so she did very well that year and at the end of grade eleven. She outtakes.

270
00:30:44,25 --> 00:30:46,27
Award for all round. Excellent.

271
00:30:48,04 --> 00:30:56,99
Although they did make a little bit of lassitude for her that allowed by eating to be recommences for them.

272
00:30:56,99 --> 00:31:03,06
And in her final year she was a student of the year. So she was a particularly motivated go.

273
00:31:04,18 --> 00:31:15,19
We have grandchildren grow up here and now. My daughter has three children of her and.

274
00:31:15,19 --> 00:31:25,99
I'm watching my grandchildren grow up with an interest. Bringing kids up here. That was hard to.

275
00:31:25,99 --> 00:31:36,88
I made a decision to come here. I suppose. And my family suffered and benefited for that. You know.
