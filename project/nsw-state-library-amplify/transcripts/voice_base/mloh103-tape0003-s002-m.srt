1
00:00:14,76 --> 00:00:21,43
Yeah that. The deep ecology idea that we're just part of the fabric of life. With every other living thing.

2
00:00:21,43 --> 00:00:25,96
And that the despair we feel for the future of the planet is the spear of all life forms on the earth.

3
00:00:26,87 --> 00:00:34,58
So the ritual involves expressing that the spear. And in. Creating him.

4
00:00:35,82 --> 00:00:40,51
Selecting an item of landscape over a species with something to represent in the council of all beings.

5
00:00:40,51 --> 00:00:46,58
And then you make a mass and then you come to the council as that creature or. Item of landscape.

6
00:00:46,58 --> 00:00:53,24
And you find voice to speak for it. And this is a very powerful ritual.

7
00:00:53,24 --> 00:00:59,93
It's a very powerful bonding experience for people who are involved in. Rainforest action or.

8
00:00:59,93 --> 00:01:05,16
You know action from the environment. And it's also very powerful it giving people voice like.

9
00:01:05,16 --> 00:01:11,51
They found the confidence in the voice to speak what they really are concerned about. So this.

10
00:01:11,51 --> 00:01:21,65
This particular ritual is. Kind of essential to the work that john slade's been doing in the rainforest life.

11
00:01:21,65 --> 00:01:26,91
Information center and the rainforest the. Action groups around the stranger who did.

12
00:01:26,91 --> 00:01:32,4
Defending the environment the people who have committed their lives. To being on the front line.

13
00:01:32,4 --> 00:01:38,89
For the environment and. Only possible. In this theory.

14
00:01:38,89 --> 00:01:45,05
Right that it was born here because they were a sufficient concentration of people committed to developing these works.

15
00:01:45,05 --> 00:01:47,07
In their life.

16
00:01:47,07 --> 00:01:52,58
So light a manifestation more current is like conflict resolution

17
00:01:52,58 --> 00:01:58,54
and negotiation skills have become a major currency up here. And people will and. The new settlers in syria.

18
00:01:58,54 --> 00:02:04,68
Do this very well. And it's taking the shape of it and then you will.

19
00:02:04,68 --> 00:02:12,18
A conference called the hot politics conference where social activists come together and discuss.

20
00:02:12,18 --> 00:02:17,02
What's been happening in their lives. You know. Particularly if they. Being in despair and burnout. Take.

21
00:02:17,02 --> 00:02:24,14
You have to find you hot. Working together and talk about techniques. Of creating. Nonviolent social action.

22
00:02:24,14 --> 00:02:29,26
The challenge is enormous. Big changes are coming and big changes are going to be made.

23
00:02:29,26 --> 00:02:35,94
How to do this nonviolently how to create say. Compassionate and. Culturally rich community.

24
00:02:35,94 --> 00:02:42,16
Is the challenge of the times. And i see it happening here. Well the time i worked in melbourne and sydney.

25
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:49,87
I did not see it. I didn't see it expressing itself in community the west see it happening on the north coast.

26
00:02:49,87 --> 00:03:11,32
Where you. River. The river. Well. Not all of the turnings of the. Not all parts of the queerest dreams. Proficiency.

27
00:03:11,32 --> 00:03:20,73
Properties fruit. You know. And some of the fruit turned sour on us and. One of the observations i have about the.

28
00:03:20,73 --> 00:03:26,73
The drug scene was that. It was part of the queerest dream that drugs were a liberation.

29
00:03:26,73 --> 00:03:36,51
We were greatly influenced by the. Timothy leary huxley. Stuff about doorways to perception that would open your mind.

30
00:03:36,51 --> 00:03:40,99
We're about expanded awareness. And i'm quite clear that the.

31
00:03:40,99 --> 00:03:43,69
Aquarius festival wouldn't have happened without the influence of marijuana

32
00:03:43,69 --> 00:03:51,16
or an illicit gens i mean that was one of the cultural stimulants that opened them on still two hundred years.

33
00:03:51,16 --> 00:04:02,56
When it was combined with the necessities of economics and then the problem of newman not being able to have a gate

34
00:04:02,56 --> 00:04:10,75
and be discriminating about the people who were coming in and camping on. You know i'm a strong enough to say no.

35
00:04:10,75 --> 00:04:17,69
We had a number of things happening. You know. We could. Look back and say that.

36
00:04:17,69 --> 00:04:25,76
Marijuana as a community second has lots of downsides. We can say with what happened was that.

37
00:04:26,8 --> 00:04:29,22
People smoke a lot of marijuana the group themselves.

38
00:04:29,22 --> 00:04:35,23
So it was always really a vial of a lot of police will blew their minds away with marijuana.

39
00:04:35,23 --> 00:04:42,82
Because it got stronger and stronger i mean i was doing selective breeding and testing it themselves or it.

40
00:04:42,82 --> 00:04:48,72
Results in a lot of liturgy in the community. We have lots of people who have ideas about how things would happen.

41
00:04:48,72 --> 00:04:54,74
But very little action very little people are able to actually bring it all together. Sit down and make have a meeting.

42
00:04:54,74 --> 00:04:59,21
That's clear enough to make agreements. Marijuana does not assist meetings.

43
00:05:00,17 --> 00:05:03,97
A lot of the early troubles we had with meetings was that people were stunned when they came to them.

44
00:05:03,97 --> 00:05:06,5
They weren't responsible what they're saying.

45
00:05:06,5 --> 00:05:14,44
They unloaded stuff and they couldn't hear marijuana stops people from hearing. What other people have got to say.

46
00:05:14,44 --> 00:05:17,72
And then there was the market side of marijuana that.

47
00:05:17,72 --> 00:05:22,55
The good thing about it was that it would provide a means of income in to build lots of houses in the state area there

48
00:05:22,55 --> 00:05:27,59
are lots of grass castles in the city. It's true to say. It provided people with income.

49
00:05:27,59 --> 00:05:30,51
And allowed them to lift themselves out of poverty.

50
00:05:30,51 --> 00:05:37,8
And to prove the conditions of the family but the other side of that was that introduced. The now eighty.

51
00:05:37,8 --> 00:05:45,08
People got easy money and. So they dismissed. The idealism of the queer in dreams as a relevant.

52
00:05:45,08 --> 00:05:52,55
What the real world is about is making money. Mate. And doing deals and being smart about the drug deals. So we had a.

53
00:05:52,55 --> 00:05:55,89
What's called the deal ocracy the people who are smart at selling drugs.

54
00:05:55,89 --> 00:06:01,19
Thought themselves to be superior and apart from what was going to else was going on.

55
00:06:01,19 --> 00:06:11,00
There is associate that with these paranoia. None of these things make them. Pull community. It's a community.

56
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:18,34
So in new old days you know. You should be able to grow. Remember when had you gotten pets and to be safe. Not now.

57
00:06:18,34 --> 00:06:22,31
People have been known to being busted people coming in with guns and stealing marijuana.

58
00:06:22,31 --> 00:06:27,46
Patches and was kind of stuff. Whole communities. Fall apart because.

59
00:06:28,05 --> 00:06:34,27
The growers afford what amongst themselves on the community. And had such a siege mentality. They didn't want business.

60
00:06:34,27 --> 00:06:40,22
What this. You know that the community ceased to work as a community. It was just a drug running cooperative.

61
00:06:40,22 --> 00:06:49,1
So there are lots of downsides. And then we had the problem of. Human being to open. So that.

62
00:06:50,42 --> 00:06:55,13
During the eighty's when they ran the government governments or in australia began closing down mental hospitals

63
00:06:55,13 --> 00:06:55,96
and putting.

64
00:06:55,96 --> 00:07:00,77
Patients on the road and saying community should look up look after them the family should look after them.

65
00:07:00,77 --> 00:07:06,11
What we got was a policeman all went straight to the saying i want to go to newman.

66
00:07:06,11 --> 00:07:17,99
And women being inundated with the walking wounded. And i can say. The addicted. I remember in the late seventy's.

67
00:07:17,99 --> 00:07:22,69
A group of. Sixteen year old alcoholics from the western suburbs of new haven.

68
00:07:22,69 --> 00:07:33,12
Descended on women and expected to be looked after. Oh sorry. I remember in the late. Member in the late eighty's.

69
00:07:34,37 --> 00:07:39,91
The late seventy's. A group of sixteen year old seventy year old.

70
00:07:39,91 --> 00:07:43,24
Alcoholics from the western suburbs of sydney descended on human.

71
00:07:43,24 --> 00:07:50,57
And one of them looked up and this was the new age and the new age would look after people like them.

72
00:07:50,57 --> 00:07:59,23
Would tolerate their behavior. And their behavior. Was disgusting. They were drunk most of the time. And abusive.

73
00:08:00,17 --> 00:08:08,85
And richard lee. Dissolute. And proud of it. They saw themselves as being punks who were there to shock.

74
00:08:09,21 --> 00:08:17,72
We old aquarians into a new sense of reality. And why did. We were shocked when reported.

75
00:08:17,72 --> 00:08:22,27
But were unable to do anything about it and that became the model for people to follow. I mean.

76
00:08:22,27 --> 00:08:28,2
One of those guys did now. Another one's on a med pension brains.

77
00:08:28,2 --> 00:08:32,94
These were desperate cases people who wanted to be did this is total neil ism. We're talking about the future.

78
00:08:32,94 --> 00:08:39,76
And suddenly we have to deal with needless. And you have no future. And on top of that. That. You know.

79
00:08:39,76 --> 00:08:46,23
The rejects the. The walking wounded who arrived in town from. The closed.

80
00:08:46,23 --> 00:08:54,13
Mental hospitals who are expected to be look i looked up. I remember the case of them and turn straight on and.

81
00:08:54,13 --> 00:09:03,58
You came to now. The town and. He was very black. He was about five foot four.

82
00:09:03,58 --> 00:09:09,95
Tall and five foot four across the shoulders. And when he got some alcohol in him he would. Hangry. And violent.

83
00:09:11,12 --> 00:09:17,54
He was looked after by the community. He was fit for free in the cafe and i asked to do some shoes.

84
00:09:17,54 --> 00:09:23,3
Just sweep in the would happily contribute to that he was you know sober he was a really nice guy to talk to the

85
00:09:23,3 --> 00:09:28,3
community. But when drunk he put his fist through the plate glass window of the rainbow cafe one night.

86
00:09:28,3 --> 00:09:38,24
And another cation he. Two women. And one night had a ton of fools. And the next day you sleeping off he's. Alcoholic.

87
00:09:38,24 --> 00:09:47,12
Fathers in the tomato sauce and. Some guys coming to town from town of all fools.

88
00:09:47,12 --> 00:09:55,76
Approached the tomato sauce put bella gloves on the face and pulled out simple b. From forty to seventy theorem.

89
00:09:55,76 --> 00:09:59,42
Cuts and beat the guy up we do about the legs. The limb no it was not.

90
00:09:59,42 --> 00:10:05,58
This is bad news when you community has been dealing with these but what other. Expression was there.

91
00:10:05,58 --> 00:10:11,01
I heard that this guy left town shortly after that he did get the new seeds

92
00:10:11,01 --> 00:10:13,81
and i heard that he was one of the deaths in custody.

93
00:10:14,44 --> 00:10:20,21
But there was like it was like the situation was if you can survive in human you can't survive anyway. You know.

94
00:10:20,21 --> 00:10:26,26
More compassion more tolerance in even than any other community i've been to. And it was much the abused.

95
00:10:26,39 --> 00:10:34,15
So what's happened more recently. Is like the street drug scene. Had got very.

96
00:10:34,15 --> 00:10:42,16
I mean it's being attended to now but for a while there it got very bad. Smith moved in i couldn't imagine.

97
00:10:42,16 --> 00:10:47,92
Its make would come to him and we always thought. In the seventy's that it required.

98
00:10:47,92 --> 00:10:51,81
More money than that but of course marijuana generated. Its own income.

99
00:10:51,81 --> 00:11:00,9
Its own drug trade so there was an exchange people would bring back an exchange for marijuana and.

100
00:11:00,9 --> 00:11:08,22
Nimbin became a holiday resort for. Junkies. Right. If you're living in the back streets of.

101
00:11:08,22 --> 00:11:09,79
You know that you and you had a habit.

102
00:11:09,79 --> 00:11:16,51
You heard about this wonderful place we can get any drug you want within ten minutes in when i go for holy name and so.

103
00:11:16,51 --> 00:11:24,98
Newman developed its own hard drug scene and. This. This makes.

104
00:11:24,98 --> 00:11:30,11
In another sense this is like newman being a prophetic community it's only acting at what's happening in other.

105
00:11:30,11 --> 00:11:34,94
Other cities but doing it much more blatantly and much more upfront. Than anywhere else. It's true.

106
00:11:34,94 --> 00:11:40,88
But newman only has one main street and. The smack scene is right smack in the middle of it and.

107
00:11:40,88 --> 00:11:46,19
Visitors coming to him and don't see the new age optimism the rainbow power company. What they see as work down.

108
00:11:46,19 --> 00:11:57,69
People. No light in their eyes or to know that is in the future and. It's kind of got. Institutionalized.

109
00:11:57,69 --> 00:12:05,14
You know like. There's sufficient concentration to have its own mores in its own defense. Not easily moved.

110
00:12:05,14 --> 00:12:20,27
Not easily hidden and. Not a great advertisement for anyone. No more sense of failure from nimbin.

111
00:12:20,27 --> 00:12:26,18
Community trying to deal with the effect of drugs and i think.

112
00:12:26,18 --> 00:12:31,58
I agree with what i said about this the problem is the law. Prohibition creates the problem.

113
00:12:32,99 --> 00:12:39,11
If marijuana and heroin were available. Legally and.

114
00:12:39,11 --> 00:12:44,02
Controlled in the same way as the supply of alcohol and cigarette in the containers controlled.

115
00:12:44,02 --> 00:12:50,74
We wouldn't have the market situation we wouldn't have the economy that supports the scene and.

116
00:12:50,74 --> 00:12:55,79
All the downside of it would be removed. It could be treated it could be addressed as a community problem.

117
00:12:55,94 --> 00:13:02,69
But while we have a this is covert. There's no way you can bring the forces of light onto it you know like. You.

118
00:13:02,69 --> 00:13:11,93
You can't have active programs. You. You can't create. A community. Rehabilitation program.

119
00:13:11,93 --> 00:13:20,93
That's going to work because the culture of the. Addiction is self-supporting you know. Anyway. It's a nutty problem.

120
00:13:20,93 --> 00:13:26,16
I think. I've got more hope than him and i'll do something creative about it than anywhere else. But it's like.

121
00:13:26,16 --> 00:13:32,62
It's one of the things that newman and hear it from aquarius that has its dockside set aside and talking

122
00:13:32,62 --> 00:13:42,24
and share this. Let me talk about this other aspect of nimbin. That. When we were organizing the queerest festival.

123
00:13:42,32 --> 00:13:45,08
We heard this rumor that was coming from the aboriginal community.

124
00:13:45,08 --> 00:13:52,58
In melbourne of all places that nimbin had a coup supported. And it was the valley had been cursed.

125
00:13:52,58 --> 00:13:56,41
It was said that they'd been a message to the and.

126
00:13:56,41 --> 00:14:04,25
And i could have been put on by the aboriginal people that nothing would ever prosper. That happened in that valley.

127
00:14:04,25 --> 00:14:12,03
To somehow the kiss was lifted. So i was really interested to find out about this it was part of the myth making.

128
00:14:12,03 --> 00:14:18,12
The festival. And i went chasing.

129
00:14:18,12 --> 00:14:23,75
Every zone leaders in the am searching them out to find out what they knew about it and i came to the nothing.

130
00:14:23,81 --> 00:14:32,95
You know. I mean. Uncle lisle and. Who is the average loner at the time. And he knew nothing about it or if you did.

131
00:14:32,95 --> 00:14:36,91
He was unwilling to talk about it. But the woods that was said.

132
00:14:36,91 --> 00:14:44,06
Were when i asked him about his spiritual issues when i got back with christian. Woods right.

133
00:14:44,06 --> 00:14:48,56
So my feeling was a bunch of young people have been so effectively. Christianized.

134
00:14:48,56 --> 00:14:56,36
That they didn't know the story anymore. If it wasn't immediately available. So we went into the festival. With it.

135
00:14:56,36 --> 00:15:02,56
Hanging over us and. A couple of years and. In about nine hundred seventy seven. I had an opportunity to visit.

136
00:15:02,56 --> 00:15:10,68
Kath walker. Stradbroke on. And it was. We had a remarkable night. With catherine and her camp fire.

137
00:15:10,68 --> 00:15:17,02
Which she showed us some of her sherman. Abilities sherman palace and of poetry.

138
00:15:17,02 --> 00:15:20,12
And the madness and all that kind of stuff of on those nights.

139
00:15:20,12 --> 00:15:23,04
And in the course i told her story of nim and what was happening there.

140
00:15:23,04 --> 00:15:28,87
And she expressed interest in finding it more and i was interested if i have the aboriginal story.

141
00:15:29,05 --> 00:15:33,54
So i invited cat who had come to him and. Stay with us for a while and she did.

142
00:15:33,54 --> 00:15:39,47
And she stayed with a friend and at the end of a week stay. I went to see you. And i say well what do you think.

143
00:15:39,47 --> 00:15:50,5
What do you know. You see that she is feeling with that newman. Was my initiation ground. The.

144
00:15:50,5 --> 00:15:58,44
Very strong country that. This is not good for women. So it's not a place where women are going to prosper.

145
00:16:00,13 --> 00:16:05,43
So i take that into account. And the other thing. Other thing about it. Is that.

146
00:16:05,43 --> 00:16:14,25
It's a place where people come to learn. Young men coming through initiation. And if you stay too long.

147
00:16:14,5 --> 00:16:20,63
You don't get the initiation if you don't learn. And move on then you turn to stone.

148
00:16:20,63 --> 00:16:29,16
And i think that the rocks will take the energy back that take the teaching. Back and you'll be become. Region. And.

149
00:16:29,89 --> 00:16:32,62
I got this misleads.

150
00:16:32,62 --> 00:16:37,61
Nine hundred seventy seven the battle of trainee creek with noni seventy eight and i was like i felt.

151
00:16:37,61 --> 00:16:44,19
Developed or any crick for me was like. As much as i could do in community organization. I mean i got.

152
00:16:44,19 --> 00:16:51,37
What i wanted the community was strong enough. You know. It was working as a community and. I did.

153
00:16:51,37 --> 00:16:57,56
Fictive really been marginalized by my. Radical stand on the first fight. So that any time i try to do anything.

154
00:16:57,56 --> 00:17:04,08
You know i had a chorus of voices saying shut up. Stop. Don't do anything more you cause too much trouble.

155
00:17:05,87 --> 00:17:16,42
I begin to realize that my initiation was. It was time for me to move on. So those words had a personal meaning for me.

156
00:17:16,42 --> 00:17:22,86
But i also observe them in him and i see that. Part of the drug problem in nimbin is young people.

157
00:17:22,86 --> 00:17:31,09
Because that the drug market the drug dealers. Namely usually. Typically people selling drugs the tourist.

158
00:17:31,09 --> 00:17:40,51
Typically nineteen eighteen year olds who lack. Appropriate initiation. They path the man who is. Off the riles.

159
00:17:41,25 --> 00:17:48,24
And it needs. Stronger. Initiation. To bring them in line. Also. Is that when you.

160
00:17:48,42 --> 00:17:55,61
If this is forty thousand years old this wisdom. About this country. And if you ignore it you do so at the peril.

161
00:17:55,61 --> 00:18:03,26
And it's as if. If you. Muck around with that kind of energy. It has its own eighty eighty s you know so what was.

162
00:18:03,26 --> 00:18:10,55
Was that positive thing for learning. Turns in on itself. And then the shadows. Reveal themselves.

163
00:18:10,55 --> 00:18:19,74
So you know since then there's an e. Meter is a metaphor. In here about. The social problems and even the drug problem.

164
00:18:19,74 --> 00:18:27,82
Is being generated. Being. The shadow of the korean dream. Because somehow the land is being abused. Somehow.

165
00:18:27,82 --> 00:18:39,41
Not enough respect. Is being taken of the energy that. That bellina here and lee has. So. Naman. It's my.

166
00:18:40,47 --> 00:18:54,13
Mother of joy mother of this be. It broke my heart. It broke it open. Yeah.
