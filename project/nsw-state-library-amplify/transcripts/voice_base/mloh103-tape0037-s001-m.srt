1
00:00:05,86 --> 00:00:10,92
Ok. Type or do you choose the second of march no they don't need three.

2
00:00:10,92 --> 00:00:17,91
Home in sydney and jones so it is in leeds more we're doing a two way.

3
00:00:17,91 --> 00:00:21,51
Joint going to give you start introducing who you are and.

4
00:00:21,51 --> 00:00:32,04
When you first came to nimbin urn how you describe how you feeling. Well. My name's john. And presently. I guess.

5
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:41,64
Rainforest conservationist and. Philosopher. Are often in august nine hundred seventy three.

6
00:00:41,64 --> 00:00:50,4
Are been living in england for five years and i was on my way back to australia.

7
00:00:50,4 --> 00:00:57,81
Travelling for about nine months out of the land through asia. Meditating in india and nepal studying meditation.

8
00:00:57,81 --> 00:01:06,36
And i never heard of newman. Or the aquarius festival. Back in august. And then a good friend of mine carol elliott.

9
00:01:06,36 --> 00:01:15,68
Who's. You know a pretty important figure i think in the nimbin story carol elliott norman stand. When i got to see me.

10
00:01:15,68 --> 00:01:17,25
With my wife gretta.

11
00:01:18,86 --> 00:01:23,54
They said oh you've got to go up to nimbin and we've got a place that you can stay at on crofton's route.

12
00:01:23,54 --> 00:01:31,46
So we drove straight up we didn't like sydney too much we drove straight up and. Well it's been here ever since.

13
00:01:31,46 --> 00:01:38,06
Can you tell us about those early does. In how you started out. Well. I remember.

14
00:01:38,06 --> 00:01:43,65
Carolyn norman saying when you get to nimbin. Just go to the rainbow cafe and ask for jim.

15
00:01:43,65 --> 00:01:46,32
And i thought you know i just thought of an australian cafe

16
00:01:46,32 --> 00:01:51,59
and i thought oh that's an unusual name for a cafe the right. And we got to nimbin and.

17
00:01:51,59 --> 00:01:58,42
There was the rainbow exactly where it is now and. We got there just in time for dinner which was a commune all male.

18
00:01:58,42 --> 00:02:08,97
Around. One long table and. Basically our. I realized the whole of the. New settler community in that region.

19
00:02:08,97 --> 00:02:13,61
Was sitting around that table that not you know that everyone had gone back from the festival

20
00:02:13,61 --> 00:02:19,74
when there was just a handful of people maybe twenty or thirty people. Left after the festival and.

21
00:02:19,74 --> 00:02:27,42
They're all sitting around that table. So it's grown a lot since then. So you do so yourself was part of that.

22
00:02:28,15 --> 00:02:35,73
Back to the earth movement. You know to get back to. You know starting your own port building your own who.

23
00:02:35,73 --> 00:02:42,64
Well i quickly came to see myself that way that wasn't my original intention in going up there originally i just moved

24
00:02:42,64 --> 00:02:45,82
to the country and. I had you know.

25
00:02:45,82 --> 00:02:55,48
Some interesting communities i'd been part of i kind of abortive attempted a community in northern california a couple

26
00:02:55,48 --> 00:03:01,21
of years previously that on the last a few months. But i had. You know i had time to bargo.

27
00:03:01,21 --> 00:03:07,63
Create my first garden which was in a spiral and. You know i would. But quickly.

28
00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:13,27
I came to you know be very much part of that movement and.

29
00:03:13,27 --> 00:03:21,46
I was part of the original group of shareholders in the dream that. Of coordination cooperatives that.

30
00:03:21,46 --> 00:03:28,91
Then went on to become the community a town of all falls and grettir and i bought shares in that. Before.

31
00:03:28,91 --> 00:03:34,25
You know there was any land or anything like that we just bought shares in that dream and.

32
00:03:35,65 --> 00:03:39,67
But i myself was looking for a more spiritual community. So i want to.

33
00:03:40,51 --> 00:03:44,78
You know i've been meditating in india and nepal as i say

34
00:03:44,78 --> 00:03:54,35
and as soon as we arrived in australia we made contact with an english. Buddhist monk he was. You know.

35
00:03:54,35 --> 00:04:03,65
Wearing tar i put a strobe scald who was teaching meditation at the chinese buddhist society in dixon street in sydney

36
00:04:03,65 --> 00:04:06,94
and we invited him up and. He did.

37
00:04:06,94 --> 00:04:12,99
The first meditation retreats i think it was still in seventy three or maybe seventy four. We organized maybe.

38
00:04:12,99 --> 00:04:18,31
Are over the next couple of years five or six. Meditation retreats for him which. I think you know.

39
00:04:18,31 --> 00:04:25,71
Had quite a profound influence on the direction of that community most of the people who were up there at that time.

40
00:04:25,71 --> 00:04:34,4
Took part in one or more of those retreats. And so. I was looking for a more cohesive.

41
00:04:34,4 --> 00:04:38,35
Integrated like minded community of people who are committed to.

42
00:04:38,35 --> 00:04:44,19
Personal and spiritual growth and coordination cooperative intangible we're always a little bit too kind of crazy

43
00:04:44,19 --> 00:04:52,08
and walled for my own tastes. At that time. And. So you're not in seventy five.

44
00:04:53,85 --> 00:04:57,4
Dominant which is a community into a creek road.

45
00:04:57,4 --> 00:05:05,62
That had actually started before the aquarius festival i bought that land i think in seventy one or seventy two and.

46
00:05:05,62 --> 00:05:14,17
The land stretch from training a creek up to wallace road on the. Reach that separates a creek from tunnel creek and.

47
00:05:14,17 --> 00:05:20,52
Dominant addai knighted a section of their land on top of that ridge for the dream that i had had

48
00:05:20,52 --> 00:05:27,03
and that i shared with them of the meditation santa. And in nine hundred seventy far.

49
00:05:27,99 --> 00:05:33,05
Several of us began to build up their build a shed in seventy farve and.

50
00:05:33,05 --> 00:05:37,89
Started to build the foundations for meditation set up.

51
00:05:37,89 --> 00:05:44,92
And then later in seventy five i went back to india again for more meditation and to spend some time with a teacher.

52
00:05:44,92 --> 00:05:51,09
A woman called. Who also came back and forth. Teaching.

53
00:05:52,05 --> 00:06:00,51
In australia and up in the newman area a few times and the years after that. And at that time. In dallas.

54
00:06:00,51 --> 00:06:05,27
In the himalayas. While i was there to spend some time with the miller and.

55
00:06:05,7 --> 00:06:12,33
Norman standout and carol elliott who started birth and beyond. You name been. Birthing.

56
00:06:15,25 --> 00:06:22,37
Midwife so i guess that i that i you know i met to be with him a lot. And we also met another.

57
00:06:23,45 --> 00:06:28,98
Tabu just monk an englishman. Whose name now is christopher to miss and he's quite a famous.

58
00:06:29,81 --> 00:06:37,76
Progressive meditation teacher who lives in england now and he's no longer a monk but. He was in.

59
00:06:37,76 --> 00:06:43,56
Carolyn norman we're doing a meditation retreat with him and. A whole bunch of young westerners were there.

60
00:06:43,56 --> 00:06:48,07
So i went looking for carolyn norman. Walking up to sort of this beautiful mountain.

61
00:06:48,07 --> 00:06:53,64
And i came around the turn of the mountain and there was this little. Char shop. You know like a little tea shop.

62
00:06:53,64 --> 00:07:01,1
Called the todd man's do a lot of the looking. You know. Plain of the ganges. Many thousands of feet below.

63
00:07:01,1 --> 00:07:05,9
And there's a whole bunch of young. Westerners there americans new zealanders australians.

64
00:07:05,9 --> 00:07:12,09
Sitting around drinking coffee and eating sweet cakes from this meditation retreat. And i sat down with them.

65
00:07:12,09 --> 00:07:15,43
And within five minutes. We had agreed that.

66
00:07:15,43 --> 00:07:20,25
You know whole bunch of them were coming over to help build this meditation center and that we're going to.

67
00:07:20,25 --> 00:07:26,86
Then look for a piece of land near bar to bar and. To grow our food and build their houses and.

68
00:07:26,86 --> 00:07:33,2
That we'd be caretakers of the meditation center. And that was what actually happened so.

69
00:07:33,2 --> 00:07:39,71
Within about ten minutes of that meeting the next. I guess. At least the next five years of model off.

70
00:07:39,71 --> 00:07:46,58
Were pretty well. Laid out on a map and. What we discussed there was exactly what happened.

71
00:07:46,58 --> 00:07:52,42
Christopher came to australia a few months later. Maybe about maybe nearly a year later.

72
00:07:52,42 --> 00:07:59,1
To lead the first meditation retreat at this meditation center that we had built in the mean time and.

73
00:07:59,1 --> 00:08:06,13
The participants in those actually three retreats and. Maybe about fifty participants in. H.

74
00:08:06,13 --> 00:08:13,29
So out of those hundred fifty people we found twenty who wanted to share that dream of a spiritual community.

75
00:08:13,29 --> 00:08:26,88
And we each put in a thousand bucks and. So. That was in. Seventy five seventy six and. Basically up until the creek.

76
00:08:26,88 --> 00:08:35,1
Action in seventy nine. That was my last there. My son was born a his name is buddy. He's fifteen now and.

77
00:08:35,1 --> 00:08:45,24
He was the first child born on that farm so he was named after it and. We build our own houses and you know.

78
00:08:45,24 --> 00:08:51,46
Kids grew organic fruit and veggies and stuff and. Lived a very pure and beautiful life there.

79
00:08:51,86 --> 00:09:02,42
Tell us about some of the. The rules. Of body farm some of the ethics. Well it was a very very highly ethical.

80
00:09:02,42 --> 00:09:14,04
Society we live by the buddhist precepts of killing. Stealing lawing. Drugs or alcohol. And no sexual misconduct.

81
00:09:14,04 --> 00:09:25,42
I mean you know. Sexual conduct it. Hurt anyone and. We didn't keep any animals are other domestic animals or.

82
00:09:25,42 --> 00:09:26,59
You know a lot of stock.

83
00:09:27,45 --> 00:09:32,78
We just want didn't want to have any fences we just wanted to live with the animals from the bush and.

84
00:09:32,78 --> 00:09:39,96
We didn't want any dogs or cats getting into the bush. And we had a forest management policy which left.

85
00:09:39,96 --> 00:09:45,27
Ninety five percent of the. Hundred sixty acres that we bought. It was left as bush.

86
00:09:45,27 --> 00:09:52,7
And the only areas that we cleared were areas that had previously been cleared. You know i saw about.

87
00:09:52,7 --> 00:09:57,31
Maybe about ten percent of the land. About sixteen acres i'd say maximum.

88
00:09:57,31 --> 00:10:05,27
We maintained for a buildings near agriculture. We looked after each other and shared. Most of our things in.

89
00:10:05,53 --> 00:10:12,52
Common we shared all of our mode of eagles at in those early days for instance and.

90
00:10:12,75 --> 00:10:20,06
We had a calming all male every day we cooked for each other and. You know i just looked after each other there was no.

91
00:10:20,06 --> 00:10:27,01
Doors necessary on the buildings now and you know. It was totally safe place to have kids and we were also you know.

92
00:10:27,01 --> 00:10:35,78
Very interested in social action. This was our style of buddhism was. What you might call. Engaged. Buddhism and.

93
00:10:35,78 --> 00:10:42,12
We were involved in the social issues of those days especially the home birth. Movement which was.

94
00:10:42,12 --> 00:10:47,12
Illegal and we you know participated in those illegal. Births we felt that it was.

95
00:10:47,12 --> 00:10:51,06
Everybody's right to take birth and death and. These things back.

96
00:10:51,06 --> 00:10:56,23
Back from or thora jesus and back into our own hands and.

97
00:10:56,23 --> 00:11:02,1
It's kind of a bit on real now looking back on it you know like everything's changed so much since those days

98
00:11:02,1 --> 00:11:08,52
but it was a very beautiful time. We built sixteen. Illegal. On this place.

99
00:11:10,25 --> 00:11:16,24
Multiple occupancy wasn't allowed then in fact. It was partly the court cases.

100
00:11:16,24 --> 00:11:24,86
The sixteen demolition orders that were put on two buildings that were part of the. You know. Part of the trigger.

101
00:11:24,86 --> 00:11:31,46
You know or the part of the whole thing that created multiple occupancy in new south wales.

102
00:11:32,43 --> 00:11:35,64
Looking back on those terms. To you.

103
00:11:35,64 --> 00:11:43,14
Do you think it's too hard on you so so far no not at all i mean if we were to try

104
00:11:43,14 --> 00:11:46,26
and do that from a sense of sacrifice or.

105
00:11:46,26 --> 00:11:50,32
You know or just a sense of duty or anything like that it would have been terribly difficult.

106
00:11:50,32 --> 00:11:57,65
But it was totally passionate desire you know we were following our bliss erik's to see. And i can't think that.

107
00:11:58,06 --> 00:12:04,91
Any of us have ever been happier since then do you know i've had things change and. Times change we were on a wife.

108
00:12:04,91 --> 00:12:10,13
You know. And when you're on a wave it's easy just catch the wife and. You stay on it but.

109
00:12:10,13 --> 00:12:15,33
If you have to swim in the same direction it's a different matter. You know. We're on a wife and it was crying.

110
00:12:16,33 --> 00:12:23,39
There's no sense of fear in fact that a lot of those the level of sharing and.

111
00:12:23,39 --> 00:12:26,77
Stuff that was happening then isn't still happening nobody.

112
00:12:27,11 --> 00:12:34,5
Well i mean it's easy to get into that you know like idealising the past or something like that but it's.

113
00:12:34,5 --> 00:12:38,94
I don't think it's a sense of failure it's a birdie farm is an incredibly beautiful place now

114
00:12:38,94 --> 00:12:45,1
and in fact i'm living there again. I've been away for quite some years but i've moved back there again and.

115
00:12:45,1 --> 00:12:51,33
I think it's fantastic. And the fact that there's only one communal meal or two a week now and the fact that.

116
00:12:51,33 --> 00:12:58,83
People don't share their cars anymore because it was just such a hassle maintaining. You know it's shared. Vehicles.

117
00:12:58,83 --> 00:13:04,4
And you know other things that's another thing at the beginning was that now on

118
00:13:04,4 --> 00:13:10,57
and there are buildings that anyone who build a building on the land. It belong to the land so that you know.

119
00:13:10,57 --> 00:13:17,32
If you left. You just. It was left there for someone else you know and. So there's no buying or selling of buildings.

120
00:13:17,32 --> 00:13:23,75
That's kind of changed a little bit i mean you know. Not. Not totally but you know.

121
00:13:23,75 --> 00:13:34,15
Things you know things change people get older and. I think it's still great. What about the strain on relationships.

122
00:13:34,15 --> 00:13:43,27
Plus what my body found in those so we go. Well i don't think i can remember anything anything. Particular you know.

123
00:13:43,27 --> 00:13:43,76
I mean.

124
00:13:43,76 --> 00:13:48,92
I don't think that there was such a strain on relationships i think that there's a huge strain on relationships in a

125
00:13:48,92 --> 00:13:54,44
nuclear family situation where. The only people that you have that you're close to. You know.

126
00:13:54,44 --> 00:13:58,92
You know like three or four people and then. With them they're on top of you all the time.

127
00:13:58,92 --> 00:14:05,27
Place like body farm all of the kids had. You know. A dozen. You know people that they laughed and.

128
00:14:05,64 --> 00:14:13,07
Held in were close to and if your parents were off the air. It just didn't matter so much. You know and.

129
00:14:13,07 --> 00:14:19,57
Also there was you know levels of sharing and. Communion and intimacy that i think.

130
00:14:20,52 --> 00:14:23,68
You know that that's how we're meant to live really you know that's how we.

131
00:14:23,68 --> 00:14:27,23
That's that's how our tribes were for hundreds of thousands of years and.

132
00:14:27,23 --> 00:14:30,29
I think it's a terrible strain to try and live any other way.

133
00:14:32,5 --> 00:14:37,18
Can you tell us about the development of the growing lobby of the rainforest a promotion center.

134
00:14:37,18 --> 00:14:45,31
And where you fit into that. Well. That goes back to august seventy nine when you know a creek blew up and.

135
00:14:45,31 --> 00:14:50,26
This was a much more just start again and. To make it a statement.

136
00:14:50,26 --> 00:15:00,02
Back in well back in nine hundred seventy nine in august. I went to the channon market which is a monthly. Craft and.

137
00:15:00,02 --> 00:15:05,22
Produce market down the chan and just nearby. And.

138
00:15:05,22 --> 00:15:10,79
Some of their neighbors from down in the valley a creek appealed for help.

139
00:15:10,79 --> 00:15:18,22
They'd been struggling for farve years to try and stop the forestry commission from logging the end of that valley.

140
00:15:18,22 --> 00:15:22,88
Rainforest down there and they had the forestry commission coming in the following day with bulldozers

141
00:15:22,88 --> 00:15:29,71
and they wanted to help to do a blockade and. That seemed very you know.

142
00:15:30,16 --> 00:15:34,64
Far away from me from what i was interested in i was interested in meditation and.

143
00:15:34,64 --> 00:15:37,84
Organic gardening and stuff but somehow. The next day along with.

144
00:15:37,84 --> 00:15:43,12
I think just about everyone from body farm i found myself down there with a few hundred people.

145
00:15:43,12 --> 00:15:47,02
And we did this blockade and. It was incredible and.

146
00:15:47,02 --> 00:15:53,64
Somehow or other a lot of people were very very moved their lives were moved by that but manof was totally transformed.

147
00:15:53,64 --> 00:15:59,57
And in fact within two years. It had pulled me off. Entirely.

148
00:15:59,57 --> 00:16:05,27
But it started more slowly than that and i was sort of back and forth. But you know when i was in the right.

149
00:16:05,62 --> 00:16:07,82
Forest i heard it. Screaming. You know.

150
00:16:07,82 --> 00:16:13,95
And i heard screaming for help and over the next couple of years at a creek

151
00:16:13,95 --> 00:16:16,92
and later on in the campaign for the not kept range.

152
00:16:16,92 --> 00:16:23,47
And the rainforest of new south wales i became more and more modern life and the loss of the rainforest became

153
00:16:23,47 --> 00:16:26,02
and meshed. So in.

154
00:16:26,02 --> 00:16:33,07
Nine hundred ninety one having learned about the plight of the rainforests in many other countries and.

155
00:16:33,07 --> 00:16:39,32
Empowered bar as success in really being able to do something. You know. Moving from a situation.

156
00:16:39,32 --> 00:16:40,99
In august seventy nine.

157
00:16:40,99 --> 00:16:47,93
Where most people had never even heard of rainforests let alone knew their significance to eighty two

158
00:16:47,93 --> 00:16:53,59
when the rann government made the historic decision to protect the rainforest of new south wales.

159
00:16:53,92 --> 00:16:55,83
We felt incredibly empowered.

160
00:16:55,83 --> 00:17:01,11
That ordinary people who didn't have any particular training or background could really do something.

161
00:17:01,11 --> 00:17:06,94
And we've also learnt that the rainforests of the world were threatened that. They contained.

162
00:17:06,94 --> 00:17:11,32
More than fifty percent of the world's. Species of plants and animals.

163
00:17:11,32 --> 00:17:16,39
And that at the current rates of destruction they would be utterly and within our own life time.

164
00:17:16,39 --> 00:17:18,63
And that this would be.

165
00:17:18,63 --> 00:17:24,57
Unprecedented in the history of the world and also that many scientists warn that if we allowed this to happen.

166
00:17:24,57 --> 00:17:30,19
The last support systems of the earth would be destroyed and complex life would vanish from the earth.

167
00:17:30,19 --> 00:17:34,16
Within a few human generations. So.

168
00:17:34,16 --> 00:17:39,73
We also discovered in writing to groups around the world that there wasn't a single group at that time.

169
00:17:39,73 --> 00:17:46,62
That had the world's rainforests on its agenda. So that's when we started the rainforest information sandor in lismore.

170
00:17:46,62 --> 00:17:53,21
And began. Networking and trying to create a network around the world. To work on far as problems in.

171
00:17:54,37 --> 00:17:57,67
You know indonesia and brazil in malaysia or a new guinea.

172
00:17:57,67 --> 00:18:03,4
And other countries where are the kind of consciousness that we had developed. Didn't exist as yet.

173
00:18:03,67 --> 00:18:12,69
And meanwhile we were still very. Are active. Issues. In australia. Right forest issues from the franklin where.

174
00:18:12,69 --> 00:18:13,91
About ten

175
00:18:13,91 --> 00:18:20,55
or fifteen of us from the lismore area were invited down by the wilderness society to help set up their blockade of the

176
00:18:20,55 --> 00:18:22,56
franklin river in i.e. Three.

177
00:18:22,56 --> 00:18:28,63
And then also up to the daintree where most of the people at the daintree protest also came from the.

178
00:18:28,63 --> 00:18:33,48
You know the from the name been. It's rainy creek lease more area and.

179
00:18:34,06 --> 00:18:37,4
But not only rain forest issues in nineteen eighty we did.

180
00:18:37,4 --> 00:18:43,85
Blockades at middle had in the mid north coast of new south wales to stop a sand mining operation there.

181
00:18:43,85 --> 00:18:51,27
And also we were very involved in the pine gap and. A lot of the women were involved in the women's.

182
00:18:51,27 --> 00:18:58,65
Actions in those days. The warship. Actions trying to stop the nuclear power and american warships.

183
00:18:58,65 --> 00:19:08,51
From entering australian waters and so on i guess there's traditionally been a lot of resentment i guess. Because of.

184
00:19:08,51 --> 00:19:14,67
Because of the fact that there's been a lot of people at the forefront of those movements from the nimbin bar north

185
00:19:14,67 --> 00:19:23,07
coast area. Do you have any apologies for that old. Bar now i mean i just think people are sour and grateful. You know.

186
00:19:23,38 --> 00:19:26,00
I mean you look at the opinion polls and it's.

187
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:31,83
Shows that ninety percent of everyone thinks that we need an environmental thing and so on and so on and.

188
00:19:31,83 --> 00:19:37,64
No one really acknowledges where the where the. You know where the lead you know. From that came from and.

189
00:19:37,64 --> 00:19:40,16
I know that it's unpopular and that makes me.

190
00:19:40,16 --> 00:19:46,23
You know i have all the more admiration for the people that did it he was this totally thankless task where people were

191
00:19:46,23 --> 00:19:49,65
abused and vilified for waking everybody up. You know.

192
00:19:49,65 --> 00:19:54,16
It's like people want to stay asleep people would rather choke to death on their own vomit in their sleep

193
00:19:54,16 --> 00:20:02,17
and wake up are enough. So i don't feel apologetic at all as you can hear. Ok what about the role of the.

194
00:20:02,17 --> 00:20:08,13
Grown extremists. And what about the term. Worries do you do this with the.

195
00:20:08,13 --> 00:20:14,41
Oh well i mean i don't you know i'm not sort of quite romantic like that myself to you know not

196
00:20:14,41 --> 00:20:22,31
but i can i get is that again a much better statement. Well. I mean i don't.

197
00:20:23,06 --> 00:20:29,38
I don't associate myself and think of myself as a as a rainbow warrior or anything romantic like that.

198
00:20:29,38 --> 00:20:35,26
But i am a green extremist and. I guess i am a rainbow warrior i mean if that. Meaning.

199
00:20:35,26 --> 00:20:40,17
Has you know if that word has any meaning and. I think that i'm surrounded by.

200
00:20:40,17 --> 00:20:47,38
Green extremists and rainbow warriors here. The local. Forest. Protection society ha ha so-called. You know.

201
00:20:47,38 --> 00:20:54,23
The lawyers wives and the rest. That i started a group called raw age and it's something like.

202
00:20:54,23 --> 00:21:00,28
Stands for something like rage against green extremists or something like that so the rainforest information center.

203
00:21:00,28 --> 00:21:00,67
Printed these t.

204
00:21:00,67 --> 00:21:04,44
Shirts with green extremists across the front and huge letters

205
00:21:04,44 --> 00:21:08,29
and it's a most popular autumn you see them everywhere and here. We sell hundreds of.

206
00:21:08,85 --> 00:21:16,38
You know people are proud to be green extremists. Can you tell us a bit about your spiritual journey and.

207
00:21:16,38 --> 00:21:23,18
You're developing your relationship with the rainforest and then that. That sort of.

208
00:21:24,18 --> 00:21:29,34
Well you know this developed slowly from those years but so i don't argue yes that i can feel so much.

209
00:21:29,34 --> 00:21:39,02
My spiritual journey. Changed from a buddhist perspective to. What i would call deep ecology of those years.

210
00:21:40,28 --> 00:21:48,01
In the buddhist perspective. Really mind and spirit and the inner life of human beings is primary.

211
00:21:48,01 --> 00:21:53,37
But it quickly became clear to me in the rainforest. That my body and my mind.

212
00:21:53,37 --> 00:22:00,12
Had evolved within these very forests over the last hundred fifty million years ago when the first.

213
00:22:00,12 --> 00:22:05,27
Flowering plants in the world were evolving. In gone on a land of a giant soup of.

214
00:22:05,37 --> 00:22:11,4
On and to include south america and australia and antarctica. Covered in rainforests.

215
00:22:11,4 --> 00:22:15,94
The place that's now cape tribulation the first flowering plants the.

216
00:22:15,94 --> 00:22:21,19
Angiosperms were developing my insistence was some kind of little rodent. Scurrying around.

217
00:22:21,19 --> 00:22:26,79
You know trying to get out from under the dinosaurs one hundred thirty million years ago. Now. Since that time.

218
00:22:26,79 --> 00:22:35,93
My body and my mind. Have evolved to where i am now and. To try and separate. The spiritual life from that.

219
00:22:35,93 --> 00:22:42,58
Incredible miracle of that evolution it seems to me is a very few tall task and also a dangerous one because.

220
00:22:42,58 --> 00:22:46,52
As a result of the way that we.

221
00:22:46,52 --> 00:22:53,53
Despise nature and think of the earth as just dirt and having no soul having no intelligence and. Life.

222
00:22:53,53 --> 00:22:56,23
And by denying our connection with that i mean.

223
00:22:56,23 --> 00:23:02,47
If we understand our own evolution then we realize that we are just like a leaf. On the tree of life.

224
00:23:02,47 --> 00:23:06,28
And that if we are a law if then it's only because the tree is alive.

225
00:23:06,28 --> 00:23:10,95
And if we are intelligent it's only part of a tiny fragment of the intelligence of the tree.

226
00:23:11,57 --> 00:23:19,11
So he is the earth which holds. Maybe ten million species of plants and animals in incredible.

227
00:23:19,11 --> 00:23:24,75
Symbiosis and cooperation and partnership and we are one of those. How can we call that.

228
00:23:24,75 --> 00:23:30,71
You know how can we think of that as being dead heck and we think of that as having no soul. So very much.

229
00:23:30,71 --> 00:23:39,23
My spiritual journey became one of surrendering to the body of which i am just one cell the body of god the living.

230
00:23:39,23 --> 00:23:47,00
Earth and. Finding that it's very easy to read. Receive instruction and meaning from our life from that that.

231
00:23:47,00 --> 00:23:51,2
In the same way as. You know my heart beats and.

232
00:23:51,2 --> 00:23:54,17
You know my lungs work and my fingernails grow you know

233
00:23:54,17 --> 00:24:00,96
and i all grow if i cooperate in order to create the integration that is this body. So i feel that we humans.

234
00:24:01,21 --> 00:24:12,02
If we will let go of their futile. Kind of self-interest with a small s. and Recognize that our own self interest.

235
00:24:12,02 --> 00:24:18,07
Can't be. Other than the interests of the earth of which. We are just a tiny fragment. You know. Then.

236
00:24:18,07 --> 00:24:21,99
You know what once we understand that then it's very easy for our lives.

237
00:24:21,99 --> 00:24:25,34
To fall back into harmony again with the earth. In the way that.

238
00:24:25,34 --> 00:24:30,13
Of course our ancestors life must have been in harmony. Or they wouldn't have survived for a minute.

239
00:24:30,13 --> 00:24:33,06
You look around at every tree and every plant every animal.

240
00:24:33,06 --> 00:24:36,49
And it lives in harmony with the earth it doesn't struggle against the earth.

241
00:24:36,49 --> 00:24:42,26
And it resists receives its instructions for the earth it knows how to feed itself how to breathe how to reproduce

242
00:24:42,26 --> 00:24:50,51
itself. But we in our arrogance. Thinking ourselves superior tonight. Have kind of. Shut ourselves off from that.

243
00:24:50,51 --> 00:24:56,7
But the good news is that all that we have to do is let go of that arrogance and recognize that we are merely.

244
00:24:56,7 --> 00:25:00,15
Part of the earth. Merely miraculously. Part of the earth.

245
00:25:00,15 --> 00:25:07,06
And then we too can fall back into harmony with the earth again and. It's only by doing this our belief that.

246
00:25:07,67 --> 00:25:12,46
Rice that our species. And indeed complex life at all will be supported on the earth.

247
00:25:13,46 --> 00:25:20,89
We are the last generation of human beings that will be in a position to make that decision. It's clear from.

248
00:25:20,89 --> 00:25:24,27
David suzuki. Says that we have less than ten years before.

249
00:25:24,27 --> 00:25:31,32
The damage to the last support systems reaches the point of no return. The damage to the air and the water in the soil.

250
00:25:31,32 --> 00:25:36,94
The poisoning of the earth these. These things will reach a point of no return. Very very soon. And that.

251
00:25:36,94 --> 00:25:44,58
Unless we take responsibility for. You know. Caring for the earth. Correctly. Living correctly on the earth.

252
00:25:44,58 --> 00:25:49,84
Our children will get a chance and no future generation of humans will have a chance because it'll be too light.

253
00:25:49,84 --> 00:25:56,31
But that can't come from a sense of sacrifice or a sense of duty as long as we feel separate from nature

254
00:25:56,31 --> 00:26:01,99
and think that. You know it that we have to somehow. Protect this thing.

255
00:26:01,99 --> 00:26:08,13
The environment you know something over their spirit separ. From us then we're doomed to failure.

256
00:26:08,13 --> 00:26:11,28
It's only when we realize that we are not the environment.

257
00:26:11,28 --> 00:26:16,02
That every breath we take connects us to the earth every drop of water or food.

258
00:26:16,02 --> 00:26:19,57
That passes into our body connects us to the earth we are connected.

259
00:26:19,57 --> 00:26:21,39
It's just that we ignore that connection

260
00:26:21,39 --> 00:26:28,9
and we define ourselves as purely spiritual beings whatever that might mean you know once we once we once we realize

261
00:26:28,9 --> 00:26:34,79
that we are part of the earth then this spiritual thing is actually very down to earth anyone who wants to prove this

262
00:26:34,79 --> 00:26:39,6
to themselves only has to hold their breath. For three minutes. You know.

263
00:26:39,6 --> 00:26:44,44
Anyone holding their breath for three minutes will quickly realize what i'm talking about. We can call it.

264
00:26:44,44 --> 00:26:47,2
The atmosphere and think that it's over there

265
00:26:47,2 --> 00:26:52,93
and that it's not really in their self interest to protect it you know stop the c.f.c.'s and so on do you know.

266
00:26:52,93 --> 00:26:59,67
But it's not the atmosphere it's part of our own body that we're talking about. And by projecting it. Out there.

267
00:26:59,67 --> 00:27:04,12
We're destroying ourselves and we're destroying the earth once we acknowledge that it's part of us.

268
00:27:04,72 --> 00:27:09,64
Then there's dissect for us necessary in order to protect it. You know if someone's.

269
00:27:09,64 --> 00:27:15,64
Soaring our leg off we don't sort of say look i'm too busy to protect it. We know it's part of us and you know.

270
00:27:15,64 --> 00:27:23,43
We just do whatever we have to do. So anyway that's my. Spiritual position i guess. I guess the detractors of the.

271
00:27:23,43 --> 00:27:23,88
Be occurring

272
00:27:23,88 --> 00:27:32,03
or duals who would say that people who moved to the newman area twenty years ago were saying the same things then.

273
00:27:32,03 --> 00:27:37,68
We only heard. You know. Less than ten years left but look we're you know we're still here and.

274
00:27:37,68 --> 00:27:45,78
It hasn't happened but the. Stuff doesn't happen. Well. So. I think it has happened. But.

275
00:27:45,78 --> 00:27:51,21
I mean you know i look around and you look at what's happening to the world. It's you know it's just a tragedy.

276
00:27:51,21 --> 00:27:58,64
You know. But you know the poisoning of the air and the oceans and. The quality of life to tearing and sour.

277
00:27:58,64 --> 00:28:05,27
But i'm personally not saying that it is going to happen in ten years myself. I'm quoting david suzuki who says that.

278
00:28:05,62 --> 00:28:13,41
I myself feel that the earth has. More resilience than that. But the fact that this is coming very very soon.

279
00:28:13,41 --> 00:28:15,5
I don't think that there's any doubt about that.

280
00:28:15,5 --> 00:28:22,95
We're losing an average of more than two hundred species every day this can't go on there's a finite.

281
00:28:22,95 --> 00:28:28,94
You know there's there's. There's there's only so much that the earth can take. I think everybody knows this anyway.

282
00:28:28,94 --> 00:28:33,54
You know this i don't think many people would say that anymore i think most people would.

283
00:28:33,54 --> 00:28:40,08
If they really were honest with themselves realize that this can't go on. Can you tell us a bit about the why that you.

284
00:28:40,08 --> 00:28:40,99
Explored.

285
00:28:40,99 --> 00:28:47,96
The earth by spirituality i'm thinking of the council of all beings which was something that you to go to

286
00:28:47,96 --> 00:28:54,44
and you co-wrote a book called thinking like a man. Can you expand on some of themes of. Well you know.

287
00:28:54,44 --> 00:28:59,03
This deep ecology philosophy which of karn of been expanding.

288
00:28:59,03 --> 00:29:04,36
You know it was very satisfying but i realized that it didn't change anything that we could have these are do years.

289
00:29:04,36 --> 00:29:19,1
But it was still terribly difficult to change our behavior. And as i looked into that i was sorry. Ok.

290
00:29:19,1 --> 00:29:28,31
So the castle of all beings was an attempt to bring. Deep ecology to life to actually change our behavior and.

291
00:29:28,31 --> 00:29:32,27
One of the things that i realized. As i was studying this problem is.

292
00:29:32,27 --> 00:29:39,16
Of how is it that we human beings can be so stupid as to soar off the very branch that we ourselves are sitting on i

293
00:29:39,16 --> 00:29:45,26
mean. Why do we do we want to commit suicide what are we doing. How come it's so difficult to change.

294
00:29:45,26 --> 00:29:52,74
And i realize that. We modern humans are the first. Civilization. In the history of the world.

295
00:29:52,74 --> 00:30:01,87
To dispense with the rituals and ceremonies that. All other peoples. Have and still do. Practice which.

296
00:30:01,87 --> 00:30:07,49
Acknowledge and nurture that interconnectedness between human. Things in the rest of the earth community.

297
00:30:07,49 --> 00:30:12,94
That it seems is that sense of interconnectedness which all other species.

298
00:30:12,94 --> 00:30:19,89
Have you know i mean baboons and flowers never forget that they are part of the earth. You know never occurs to them.

299
00:30:19,89 --> 00:30:27,12
So we humans are the first ones to think that we might be something special something superior something different and.

300
00:30:27,12 --> 00:30:33,1
The way that we've you know remained connected to the earth and remained part of the great symphony

301
00:30:33,1 --> 00:30:40,48
and not just got lost in our own ideas and thoughts. Was with these ceremonies in these rituals and.

302
00:30:40,48 --> 00:30:48,33
So the council of all beings. Is a modern version of this it's a way in which. Through a couple of days of.

303
00:30:48,33 --> 00:30:56,74
Ceremony and ritual and. And communion with each other we can reestablish. Not the idea of.

304
00:30:56,74 --> 00:31:04,06
Deep ecology but leaving experience of deep ecology the living experience that the earth is my body and.

305
00:31:04,06 --> 00:31:08,85
Once i feel that the earth is my body it becomes much much simpler. To defend the earth because it's.

306
00:31:08,85 --> 00:31:15,35
I'm no longer defending. Something outside myself and so it's like. It wasn't the right. It wasn't me.

307
00:31:15,35 --> 00:31:22,77
As a separate being defending the rainforest. The environment or i became. That part of the rainforest.

308
00:31:22,77 --> 00:31:30,2
That was acting in its own self-defense and of course self-defense. Is much much easier it doesn't require any great.

309
00:31:30,2 --> 00:31:36,88
And i believe he or any great. You know. Special qualities anybody can defend themselves.

310
00:31:36,88 --> 00:31:42,21
Can you tell us a bit about what happens during those three those in the crowd who were all brings what people actually

311
00:31:42,21 --> 00:31:50,91
do get to come around a bit. Well. First of all i'd have to say that the council of all beings can consist of all.
