1
00:00:10,45 --> 00:00:14,17
It was sort of. I was sort of.

2
00:00:14,17 --> 00:00:20,5
Working on a minimalist thinking like that whole minimalist thinking i would run into that sort of quick.

3
00:00:20,5 --> 00:00:28,79
Grab and mcluhan's. Thing and i was very very media. Aware because i was looked at to me was a whole study.

4
00:00:28,79 --> 00:00:36,84
Not public art and. A quick grab and so that people make it simple as possible. Symbols and.

5
00:00:36,84 --> 00:00:41,78
Simplify symbols of it becomes easier so. If you want to get through to the mainstream.

6
00:00:41,78 --> 00:00:47,00
The real the people that are really out of it and somehow also twix them. I mean that was my idea.

7
00:00:47,7 --> 00:00:56,2
So honestly by just creating subliminal images. So i was sort of working on a minimalist revelent.

8
00:00:56,2 --> 00:01:03,46
And so i just had a simple quote also the whole movement. You know moving with a back with a pack of just one costume.

9
00:01:03,46 --> 00:01:10,03
Which is easy. And then. I had banners and i had. Pints and things like that but i want to move into an area and.

10
00:01:10,03 --> 00:01:14,69
Go to an action. Just a whole theater to work out the health of the kid.

11
00:01:14,69 --> 00:01:19,86
And have to move in quickly and then quickly get into it. Water is this.

12
00:01:19,86 --> 00:01:23,86
You know when things are happening really fast around you just just being in it.

13
00:01:23,86 --> 00:01:27,94
And like there's sort of that instant sort of. Getting to sort of that sort of.

14
00:01:28,53 --> 00:01:33,31
You know getting into a fine box and getting into superman costumes. That's sort of an area like.

15
00:01:33,31 --> 00:01:38,84
Here you know you well yeah i like that here piers that's a theatrical thing.

16
00:01:38,84 --> 00:01:45,04
But that was another constructs all sort of fantasy in my head you know. Like that sort of like these costumes like.

17
00:01:45,04 --> 00:01:49,59
You turn into this. And i talk to mention it just it just appears.

18
00:01:49,59 --> 00:01:53,68
Nobody knows who it is they up here what i see is this just this image.

19
00:01:54,32 --> 00:02:06,71
So you play it play it up to them and the costume. Then. Be started to work the cost him in a sort of fine.

20
00:02:06,71 --> 00:02:13,42
Writing and drawing so that that it's there. You know when it's picked up. On camera it's really clear and.

21
00:02:13,42 --> 00:02:20,95
Turn from piper mash i didn't work too good with the skull thing to a gas mask concert's gas mask and is easily.

22
00:02:20,95 --> 00:02:26,46
Cranked up easy to get. And that sort of says it lasts and.

23
00:02:26,46 --> 00:02:32,71
And also putting a hood in connection with the with the with a air and breathing and pollution. So that symbols.

24
00:02:32,71 --> 00:02:40,04
Sort of work that idea. And i keep working on a sort of. I still do it i'll keep working the ideas.

25
00:02:40,04 --> 00:02:47,73
And the the costume on the back had. And the right so in the right when i was working thinking the pace. Actions.

26
00:02:47,73 --> 00:02:57,25
Mark actions were around peace and the environment at one cost him a good interface. And has. And so.

27
00:02:57,25 --> 00:02:58,89
I worked on that and.

28
00:02:58,89 --> 00:03:07,43
And the dulles saw him that i had the dollar sign we had sort of red on the edges and gold which was an x..

29
00:03:06,18 --> 00:03:12,05
I was a dollar x. And i used that name on mon i use that as. You know i like the. The x. In this.

30
00:03:12,05 --> 00:03:19,75
You know like the takes a q so the execution of the dollar was there was the weapon. And.

31
00:03:19,75 --> 00:03:26,56
But i also use it to play with it you know sort of use there's a guy. I use. I just play with the in the mind.

32
00:03:26,56 --> 00:03:35,37
Sequence of just so he sees props and. In dance wise. There's multiple forms. And then the. Then the towards.

33
00:03:35,37 --> 00:03:36,73
Then the whole

34
00:03:36,73 --> 00:03:46,00
and even now if developed it even further so you've got it's totally environmentally plugged in there doesn't even talk

35
00:03:46,00 --> 00:03:57,00
about in the right so in the right. Just says now. You know. Ecological destruction and. On it and.

36
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:03,11
And then i got to know have panels that go on to what they're going to interface panels i have just war.

37
00:04:03,81 --> 00:04:09,99
Right so this is the image of we're all sort of say in the right so in the right to say well this is just war.

38
00:04:10,14 --> 00:04:19,55
And you know missiles and. Barrels and drums. Build up a whole. Traveling kit and. A vehicle so it grew into a whole.

39
00:04:19,55 --> 00:04:25,61
Traveling at fit. Show with banners and. You know. So that whole process.

40
00:04:25,61 --> 00:04:33,68
Grew and it came to a crescendo when i went overseas with him just to take nevada and rocky flats and you know.

41
00:04:33,68 --> 00:04:39,51
Woodstock and all that washington. And then i came back.

42
00:04:39,51 --> 00:04:45,14
Recently and i come back recently and and you know so now it's really not easier. And.

43
00:04:45,14 --> 00:04:51,24
This is getting down to what why i'm here now. Is actually we need to really get down to rest the right. You know.

44
00:04:51,24 --> 00:04:56,46
The planet is indeed should we now have bad of these around the place. Sort of freaked the daylights.

45
00:04:56,46 --> 00:05:01,89
You know like with all the information freaks that they live up to we badly need to get people.

46
00:05:01,89 --> 00:05:09,35
Wiser had i can restructure their lives to heal the planet. And we need jobs the economy has to be around. Healing.

47
00:05:09,35 --> 00:05:11,76
Healing the planet it's very clear.

48
00:05:11,76 --> 00:05:16,58
Sort of we've gone through all the social experiments we've done now things that work we know what's got to be done.

49
00:05:16,58 --> 00:05:22,29
It's not as if we don't know what's going to be done. We know what's not to be done. You know not to pollute the.

50
00:05:22,29 --> 00:05:27,15
You know the nests that we. We live from. And we've got to. And we.

51
00:05:27,15 --> 00:05:42,32
We've got to stop fighting one another incorporating in you on this to to might this. World habitable for everybody is.

52
00:05:42,32 --> 00:05:49,73
That is what that's what the great one of the. Growing movement in general is these the. Is that movement. It's.

53
00:05:49,73 --> 00:05:52,64
It's growing more i mean. I'm involved with the earth.

54
00:05:52,64 --> 00:05:59,48
Repair at the moment you know was being involved with us repair found i was because i'm frank scuff from the united

55
00:05:59,48 --> 00:06:06,66
nations day because i'm also interested in changing the symbols of the united nations for. Because united nations.

56
00:06:06,66 --> 00:06:16,73
Is needs. Drastic. Reforming. And if it needs to recognize that we have n.g.o.s. And we could have an ngo.

57
00:06:16,73 --> 00:06:25,85
N.g.o.s not not. Nation states running the show body. N.g.o.s as. As a form of. Of decision making.

58
00:06:25,85 --> 00:06:28,07
Non-government organizations that help be people's.

59
00:06:28,07 --> 00:06:32,43
Bicycles and got more people moving away from governments of making decisions.

60
00:06:32,43 --> 00:06:37,45
As the power brokers but actually things come in with forums like. People. You go play.

61
00:06:37,45 --> 00:06:42,09
You know groups like greenpeace and community ida broad and friends of the earth.

62
00:06:42,09 --> 00:06:48,12
And a whole melody and that's growing more and more it is a people's movement. And so that's social groups.

63
00:06:48,12 --> 00:06:51,1
Coming out from the grassroots and from different groups.

64
00:06:51,1 --> 00:06:56,61
From different places around with people in pal them selves that the people are excited that power.

65
00:06:56,61 --> 00:07:01,87
These these decisions. Coming out. Feed themselves through government sure you have the government.

66
00:07:01,87 --> 00:07:07,65
Things but the ngos. Have to be. Listened to and has to be a major forum. I mean you don't go.

67
00:07:09,46 --> 00:07:14,15
And it's growing more so i want to see you not it. You know. You know other nations really.

68
00:07:14,93 --> 00:07:20,21
And at the beginning to move there that do have certain n.g.o.s in the united nations.

69
00:07:20,21 --> 00:07:29,5
And the last call for us the first big first summit i was n.-g. O. Organize. So it was a big big part for.

70
00:07:29,5 --> 00:07:43,07
Non-government organizations now you know that's a spiritual base is really important because that's why it's there.

71
00:07:43,07 --> 00:07:50,06
We get it we talk. We involve with the materialistic world right. Well the material wealth.

72
00:07:50,06 --> 00:07:54,23
Through meditation in my eye my experience from meditation. Sort of.

73
00:07:54,23 --> 00:08:01,56
It made me aware that we live in a world of illusions. I mean i have been involved auditions. So that. That horse.

74
00:08:01,56 --> 00:08:02,93
That spiritual connection.

75
00:08:02,93 --> 00:08:09,24
He sort of grew actually being here in you know from my experiences i mean the whole experience has been experienced

76
00:08:09,24 --> 00:08:17,85
period but my. You know i actually did these things. Totally out of from.

77
00:08:17,85 --> 00:08:23,33
You know like what happened inside of me you know i think certain brought me out i mean.

78
00:08:23,33 --> 00:08:28,58
I just got experience i mean i didn't know what i was entering into it's just these things came to me.

79
00:08:28,58 --> 00:08:31,47
It's almost like. I was like a messenger that was sort of.

80
00:08:31,47 --> 00:08:36,26
I was just part of the process and sort of linking up with other people in this process.

81
00:08:36,48 --> 00:08:40,46
And this is a whole lot of stuff written up about in spirit sort of looked at it.

82
00:08:40,46 --> 00:08:47,73
I mean it's the shambhala warrior type raisen that a warrior. Run by warriors and things like that. Yeah.

83
00:08:47,73 --> 00:08:53,85
Well they're all sort of like. We need people want to talk about people coming on the earth and.

84
00:08:53,85 --> 00:08:58,33
Rescuing the situation from the dark ages you know that's sort of destroying the planet.

85
00:08:58,33 --> 00:09:03,82
And it's will be in full been written before. I saw talent. In things and. And you cannot sort of.

86
00:09:03,82 --> 00:09:06,09
You know when you look at it and it's there.

87
00:09:06,64 --> 00:09:13,28
And so that that became you know that's sort of our sort of join that bandwagon that's and. Sort of creating.

88
00:09:13,28 --> 00:09:24,01
Being part of that that that. Movement. In my life style. But the spirituality is from observation. Around you is that.

89
00:09:24,01 --> 00:09:28,29
You know you become aware that you're connected on one thing. And then you also that.

90
00:09:28,29 --> 00:09:39,14
That you're also just this is this whole. Like you're actually right there in the here and now and.

91
00:09:39,14 --> 00:09:43,57
You're observing and you develop this consists of observation but it's delusion.

92
00:09:43,57 --> 00:09:52,31
Because if you see and hear things but it's not really. It's not tangible would still allusion ery it's elusive.

93
00:09:52,31 --> 00:10:00,37
And so where that is all that. Ask that connection that you become to connect that you connect it. And then the us.

94
00:10:00,37 --> 00:10:04,77
Is a living entity in itself you know that so living entities and.

95
00:10:04,77 --> 00:10:13,01
I was after in that spirituality i learnt that all matter is spirit. Sit up at a point there is actually a living.

96
00:10:13,01 --> 00:10:19,76
So everything. All matter is. And when we get down to recycling and. All of the rest of it the rest of the planet.

97
00:10:19,76 --> 00:10:24,41
Will become that awareness that. That everything that's my and everything is produced.

98
00:10:24,41 --> 00:10:27,39
I mean it's far fetched thinking you might be into the some people

99
00:10:27,39 --> 00:10:33,42
but to me it's not far fetched that everything is recyclable everything. Has a place in the universe.

100
00:10:33,42 --> 00:10:37,59
In this whole thing is just knowing. Just becoming a way that it says.

101
00:10:37,59 --> 00:10:44,12
This matter is a very small matter is the spirit. And it's. It's a living entity and.

102
00:10:44,12 --> 00:10:49,3
You know when you're in that mirror types of so you become aware that. For the few water any area.

103
00:10:50,09 --> 00:10:53,2
You know you can have your heart when you're shitting and pissing

104
00:10:53,2 --> 00:10:57,6
and all the rest of you just realize that you're just like another animal and.

105
00:10:57,6 --> 00:11:04,16
You're an animal just like and but you got to this other thing here the global brine thing you know. Connects you up.

106
00:11:04,16 --> 00:11:09,35
Can't put your finger on it but there is that connection. I mean i travel from here to america.

107
00:11:09,35 --> 00:11:14,61
And a see the same paypal. Doing the same things the same connection i can see sign people.

108
00:11:14,61 --> 00:11:18,01
Connect up in a striker doing exactly the same even look alike.

109
00:11:18,22 --> 00:11:21,1
And i don't know why but i don't know how but you can see.

110
00:11:21,1 --> 00:11:26,31
Act type images talk about act talk without any questions just doing things.

111
00:11:26,31 --> 00:11:29,36
Exactly the same sly the global brain you know it's just that connection.

112
00:11:29,61 --> 00:11:34,00
No answers no no i mean it's just there if you observe it.

113
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:38,23
You can see these can you know people talk about god and all the rest of knocking on the stand that.

114
00:11:38,23 --> 00:11:42,65
And i could say oh it's all relevant. So if you don't not you just a guy sort of.

115
00:11:42,65 --> 00:11:47,3
Squash everybody and so this is the why in the army why are you saying you know it to me are such.

116
00:11:47,3 --> 00:11:53,68
You know develop your own. Process. And then keep keep keep keep an eye open mind.

117
00:11:53,68 --> 00:12:02,25
And i sort of run into the guy a principle that. The living earth and and.

118
00:12:02,25 --> 00:12:04,7
I feel that we can he or we can heal the world.

119
00:12:05,78 --> 00:12:09,99
I mean is the healing we just got to be aware of what's destroying and really stop the.

120
00:12:10,96 --> 00:12:16,66
And find solutions i'm just keeping my fingers crossed. But if we do. If it does go. Place.

121
00:12:16,66 --> 00:12:22,61
I mean it's you and guys for you personally you don't it doesn't end life in general because all my free spirit.

122
00:12:22,61 --> 00:12:27,44
Will be the world will go on like the universe will go on because its plants have come and gone

123
00:12:27,44 --> 00:12:31,81
and so forth so we can have that sort of. Get away from us but at the moment i live on the earth.

124
00:12:31,81 --> 00:12:54,01
And i'm going to try my best to be. Evolved person in this time. Yeah it's a great useful tool and it wasn't. Yeah.

125
00:12:54,01 --> 00:13:04,19
Well the mind. I'm on drugs. Of its time. Was very real i mean that's true i mean that the mind drugs.

126
00:13:04,19 --> 00:13:13,08
I experienced it before because i was. First of all so was i for seizing on hundred sixty sixty nine.

127
00:13:13,08 --> 00:13:23,24
And i was slavin the whole city. Has it as a house. You know. It's called and. So become aware things in melbourne and.

128
00:13:23,24 --> 00:13:23,67
The scene

129
00:13:23,67 --> 00:13:30,29
and cause that sort of changed me i moved away from all my tribal connections with the family so i moved away from

130
00:13:30,29 --> 00:13:38,23
those sort of roots and start seeing sort of these. You know if liking to seeing things you seen the illusion.

131
00:13:38,23 --> 00:13:43,23
Talking about. Its illusionary human start seeing different things and it sort of.

132
00:13:43,23 --> 00:13:53,25
Made you aware of certain senses and hearten the senses and so forth. But it also because i was sort of.

133
00:13:53,25 --> 00:13:55,97
It was very special i really realized that community.

134
00:13:55,97 --> 00:14:00,00
That cultures in the past was this part of a spiritual connection.

135
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:04,54
That i didn't go and just drop pills in the mouth all the time and we sort of abuse that.

136
00:14:04,54 --> 00:14:09,99
That's where we've lost it in our society it's a consumerist society. And people want to have.

137
00:14:10,04 --> 00:14:16,87
They hit all the time it was not made for that was made for special rituals and certain people used to not.

138
00:14:16,87 --> 00:14:27,84
What people went through to get there. To be that and to use it for those sort of special events sort of become aware.

139
00:14:27,84 --> 00:14:33,34
But in this sort of world we sort of moved away from that sort of. You know that's how it is i mean i can't say.

140
00:14:33,34 --> 00:14:34,15
It's good

141
00:14:34,15 --> 00:14:41,01
or bad i say that the death experience is good provided people know how to put the brakes on it because it was it's

142
00:14:41,01 --> 00:14:52,54
becomes destructive just. So it has been a useful tool and and. And still. Well and i don't do it so he's got.

143
00:14:52,54 --> 00:14:59,12
I wouldn't say little you know like doggy pains on sort of i went through a sort of. Means he can't by doing.

144
00:14:59,12 --> 00:15:06,78
Be tripping on acid while on stage. And i'm going to put this on here. But i used to do that i used to. I used to.

145
00:15:06,78 --> 00:15:13,78
I went through a stage of of. Tripping on stage will perform like i did all the rehearsals without all of that.

146
00:15:13,78 --> 00:15:15,72
And did all my stuff and trip and.

147
00:15:15,72 --> 00:15:19,15
And then i do things that i do things like i'll be on stage

148
00:15:19,15 --> 00:15:22,54
and also get an idea of getting something i'll go off stage.

149
00:15:22,54 --> 00:15:26,68
And get this thing and i'll see something in the audience i'll bring it up on stage you know.

150
00:15:26,72 --> 00:15:35,47
I did things that totally freed me up because it just became this whole thing i was just you know i things were

151
00:15:35,47 --> 00:15:38,33
stretched out time was stretched out there was no fear.

152
00:15:38,33 --> 00:15:43,2
You know i took away all that because i was part of the whole carnival and performance

153
00:15:43,2 --> 00:15:47,54
when i was performing i was i was the center of attraction.

154
00:15:47,54 --> 00:15:53,86
At the world weather center with the other people around me. But it was very often a very useful.

155
00:15:53,86 --> 00:16:05,85
In terms of growth spiritual. Yeah well that's that's. Well it's a living. Kind of the living theater.

156
00:16:06,14 --> 00:16:13,16
It's a nine straight. In itself is a main street and that's what. I've been perceived since aquarius first of all.

157
00:16:13,16 --> 00:16:22,58
And putting it up was doing it up so that. It's a billboard for that to keep it like that and. So it's sort of.

158
00:16:22,58 --> 00:16:27,32
Nineteen that. That's a good thing about more of the murals that i used to it sort of keeps.

159
00:16:27,32 --> 00:16:32,33
That link as a as a theatrical. Help that. Part of it.

160
00:16:32,33 --> 00:16:35,51
But they are the other thing is that the people that come here it's like. Theatre.

161
00:16:35,51 --> 00:16:39,74
Like people perform there and i dress up in a certain way.

162
00:16:39,74 --> 00:16:45,38
And it sort of shocked the different dialects out of different people they're white i bet. But it's there.

163
00:16:45,38 --> 00:16:55,06
Because i want to say well. This is how i feel you know. And. And it's just it's sort of been left.

164
00:16:55,06 --> 00:16:57,58
Somehow it's been a place where.

165
00:16:57,58 --> 00:17:03,83
That's what i'm grateful that newman has been a place where people can bring along their different ideas which are

166
00:17:03,83 --> 00:17:10,55
totally. Not mean you know line with the with the smooth running cogs of society.

167
00:17:10,55 --> 00:17:16,65
And and creates is this tension of this thing solve problems to be solved at this is the world out there.

168
00:17:16,65 --> 00:17:22,93
Coming to name them. Which is the theater a little small little theater. You know the globe theater.

169
00:17:22,93 --> 00:17:30,25
That you walk into without any. Rehearsals you just come in there's people just bring their a particular being.

170
00:17:31,25 --> 00:17:47,03
And perform it in different ways. Oh yeah. It just carries on. Yeah. Carries on. You know that it carries on and.

171
00:17:49,4 --> 00:17:53,57
You know when you have. You just look around it's. The billboard. Billboards.

172
00:17:53,57 --> 00:18:00,47
All kinds of things that are happening around the place. For one thing it's a billboard. And even is a billboard as.

173
00:18:00,47 --> 00:18:09,99
As well as. Big for a controversial form of new ideas which is made itself into mainstream.

174
00:18:10,31 --> 00:18:14,25
And next week we've got the. The eco conference where you've got tourism.

175
00:18:14,25 --> 00:18:19,43
As a step is that a vanity and what i mean veneers and hopefully. I mean it's.

176
00:18:19,43 --> 00:18:24,69
Whatever the decision is going to be my name in will still be. That because that's how it's perceived outside.

177
00:18:26,18 --> 00:18:35,71
Any white people not aware of what it is that the artistic creative spiritual.

178
00:18:35,71 --> 00:18:43,18
Shermans in the world and i what name goodness were the ones who have been here that's just. Yeah it's great.

179
00:18:43,18 --> 00:18:52,62
If you shoot into it. If you tune into that and it's there. For others it's a total a dismal.

180
00:18:52,62 --> 00:18:55,85
That i would want to really try and my people the way that it's.

181
00:18:55,85 --> 00:19:03,03
It's really it's it's it's just one place in the world which is very important for the world the way it is so real jam

182
00:19:03,03 --> 00:19:08,49
and got to be grateful that we had inquiries first of all. And we need to celebrate of ish.

183
00:19:09,34 --> 00:19:11,96
Just to bring out all the what it.

184
00:19:12,62 --> 00:19:18,21
You know what are you know what it did then and who has developed up to now and just the whole culture and what we.

185
00:19:18,21 --> 00:19:29,39
Developing and acil of russian is what we're developing towards. Twenty one the twenty first.

186
00:19:29,39 --> 00:19:34,96
While more and more hype for the fear that that. Named and becomes. Well.

187
00:19:34,96 --> 00:19:42,55
In the mind straight i like to see turn into a mole and. And the traffic rate directed at just on the physical level.

188
00:19:42,55 --> 00:19:52,37
Like we do get funding. To do things. Have alternative ideas that are dreamt up.

189
00:19:52,37 --> 00:19:56,02
That really work well for here do happen even i was terribly expensive to do that

190
00:19:56,02 --> 00:20:06,64
but we can do it because a lot of things that gets short circuited. Because because. It's too expensive. But thank you.

191
00:20:06,64 --> 00:20:10,84
If people put their heart and soul into like governments like. You know.

192
00:20:11,45 --> 00:20:19,54
Let's do it it's a good idea that all the drug issue in the mainstream will be totally changed. If this becomes.

193
00:20:19,54 --> 00:20:24,21
You know i walked thorough fair with all carts of people cars and cultures. Which it will be.

194
00:20:24,21 --> 00:20:29,67
Once it becomes a more it will be a lot more people want all concert cultures all the change in him is changing.

195
00:20:29,67 --> 00:20:38,16
That whole thing that of him and just being there sort of. That just sort of was a. Take a lot.

196
00:20:38,16 --> 00:20:40,64
And not be just another saying which was. Well.

197
00:20:40,64 --> 00:20:46,41
We need to find probably solutions to helping people that are really on drugs. You know i'm creating.

198
00:20:46,41 --> 00:20:53,36
You know i really screwed up. And hopefully put in. You know the whole drug issues put in perspective.

199
00:20:53,36 --> 00:21:01,67
Into perspective. In specially that. You know marijuana for instance you know and just suppression of the information.

200
00:21:01,67 --> 00:21:08,28
For what it is. And then. That education would put it above and put it on level doesn't go underground.

201
00:21:08,28 --> 00:21:16,9
Because people are destroying themselves you know with fear and and and. And they being.

202
00:21:16,9 --> 00:21:26,32
Being manipulated being being exploited by criminal elements. Not not not by korean. Elements.

203
00:21:26,32 --> 00:21:32,37
By elements which owing to the grade the same grades that i portray.

204
00:21:32,37 --> 00:21:37,45
People into quick money sort of the chopping down forests and too.

205
00:21:37,45 --> 00:21:43,37
For for it's for wood chipping and so for a multi national level. And getting a quick.

206
00:21:43,37 --> 00:21:50,5
Get as much out of the environmental polluting. So that they you know just. Just so they can make money.

207
00:21:50,5 --> 00:21:56,04
Just the whole thing is just making money out of drugs. And it's the same sort of mentality of people just.

208
00:21:56,04 --> 00:22:03,89
Exploiting and exploiting people by giving him. Stuff that they shouldn't be given. And but i can't.

209
00:22:03,89 --> 00:22:09,99
And the only way you can. Change that situation is. First of all to make a total.

210
00:22:10,93 --> 00:22:17,54
Because police are involved as well as governments involved with the whole distribution of drugs.

211
00:22:17,54 --> 00:22:26,67
Petrochemical companies might get the whole drug. Pop. Top popping drugs and it's not just about. About smoking.

212
00:22:26,67 --> 00:22:34,76
And that it's always been with his drugs and. The only way that you can be mystified is education.

213
00:22:34,76 --> 00:22:41,31
And is a better way of living in facades the positive of. You can do away with it i mean surprises you.

214
00:22:41,31 --> 00:22:48,25
Certain people are going on to get off it and get on with. You know. Not destroying themselves i would so.

215
00:22:48,25 --> 00:22:51,87
All rescue them before hand. By saying hey you know. We don't.

216
00:22:53,18 --> 00:22:58,17
These are the alternative troi these things are you know you create people come to nimbin looking for.

217
00:22:58,17 --> 00:23:07,05
Seeking a chinese you know it's or it's a refuge. It's a refuge to newmans a refuge for for people that have had it.

218
00:23:07,05 --> 00:23:12,17
Had it really bad out there in the in the world. And it's a sort of a car and the place a toll in place.

219
00:23:12,85 --> 00:23:16,42
So i mean these issues have to be addressed and.

220
00:23:16,42 --> 00:23:22,76
As in those nice simplistic answers because we're dealing with a whole world. Global brian thinking about it.

221
00:23:22,76 --> 00:23:28,22
So we just got a look at what other people have other people are dealing with the drug drug issues

222
00:23:28,22 --> 00:23:34,32
and how it's changing and helping to change the law and these ideas. And hopefully name will come up with a unified of.

223
00:23:34,32 --> 00:23:44,75
Idea to try to to change the situation here you know i've got my ideas of of. You know communities.

224
00:23:44,75 --> 00:23:52,29
Where people can plant trees and. You know it seems for the environment and. Hang around music around them.

225
00:23:52,29 --> 00:23:59,56
The whole thing of festival continuous festival. But i can. They doing things for the involved living on the us.

226
00:23:59,56 --> 00:24:01,75
And they're doing things and they sort of.

227
00:24:01,75 --> 00:24:11,95
Get involved with that sort of integrate themselves with with a culture that's one thing. I mean. This and just.

228
00:24:11,95 --> 00:24:20,91
Infinite ideas of that sort of creative living. Creative living. And healing. L. Cells because the whole thing.

229
00:24:20,91 --> 00:24:27,56
Aquarius was about survival. You know was the whole key thing of the chris festivals was crawling. Crying out.

230
00:24:28,17 --> 00:24:34,85
We are destroying ourselves you know wars destroying the in the. The pollution it's unlike you.

231
00:24:34,85 --> 00:24:45,46
We were aware of the pollution in the cities and it is at the back. Straight through. So. So we're going to save.

232
00:24:45,46 --> 00:24:49,00
You know like. We save the planet that's the key phrase of.

233
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:54,14
Save the earth of woodstock at the moment you know the woodstock earth. For instance and.

234
00:24:56,24 --> 00:25:02,69
But that's that's it we need to become healers on the earth. And so we've got a lot of knowledge.

235
00:25:02,69 --> 00:25:09,44
Developed and got to keep developing because we haven't got through a lot of strength and individual.

236
00:25:09,44 --> 00:25:23,33
Energy and be bright and. And exercise you off your communication skills. Rise and i hope everybody.

237
00:25:23,33 --> 00:25:27,75
Puts energy towards nick she is a queer sort of it's not just about a festival.

238
00:25:27,75 --> 00:25:36,5
It's about celebrating a period in town and. I'm all stoning time. So the ideas come out of the community. You know.

239
00:25:36,5 --> 00:25:41,09
All forms of the community i mean or government. People coming out and and.

240
00:25:41,09 --> 00:25:48,93
Put on a forum or want a forum about governments. You know. To get together with. About alternative government and.

241
00:25:49,35 --> 00:25:56,45
And so forth and have it as part of the celebration. Anyone just on of the banner of aquarius foundation.

242
00:25:56,45 --> 00:26:04,35
Three five forty five plug for their creators foundation. But they're curious. Next sherry's.

243
00:26:04,35 --> 00:26:09,99
And through the name been used likening touchwood name been used to get in touch in even using that that name and.

244
00:26:10,11 --> 00:26:19,09
This is a good. Good a good connection with. Development of the thinking of members.

245
00:26:19,09 --> 00:26:27,96
Is so few people really want to know how neighborhoods. He's been developing and is subscribed to in the news.

246
00:26:27,96 --> 00:26:39,15
He's a post office box name and two on on things like they're. Three on two on your part of his name. So that's.
