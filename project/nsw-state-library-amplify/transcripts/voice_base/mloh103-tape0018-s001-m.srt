1
00:00:18,83 --> 00:00:41,25
So this is all right you. Should cover church. K.o.v. Icy icy. Sky came up here when i was about mines martin.

2
00:00:41,92 --> 00:00:51,9
I've been out of high school for two years. I'm writing. Planning on going back to university next year.

3
00:00:51,9 --> 00:00:57,6
I came to new when i was about nine. So that means how long is that. Nineteen twenty now.

4
00:00:57,6 --> 00:01:07,17
So that's more than ten years. I've been up in this area. I spent. Probably most of my school years.

5
00:01:07,17 --> 00:01:09,78
Living in the area if not travelling to lose more to go to high school.

6
00:01:09,78 --> 00:01:13,32
I spent the last three days of promise school here.

7
00:01:13,32 --> 00:01:18,43
And i've sort of seen i've had things to do with both sides of the name been in town.

8
00:01:21,6 --> 00:01:29,53
More there's there's always been a sort of division or. A pretty recognizable rift between. Between the original.

9
00:01:29,53 --> 00:01:35,6
Although the old timers you know the rednecks the settlers. Dairy farmers. What have you.

10
00:01:35,6 --> 00:01:39,01
And the alternative community which came in after seventy three

11
00:01:39,01 --> 00:01:43,33
and a even though they're sort of pretty much reconciled now.

12
00:01:43,33 --> 00:01:46,59
I've noticed that that division has always been there and i think it always will be there.

13
00:01:47,48 --> 00:01:52,79
You know and i've seen it not only in nimbin. But in any way. You know where that where that's have alternative.

14
00:01:52,79 --> 00:01:59,35
Sort of. Our pricing is happened. It's sort of a it's a big influential thing on the society but it's not actually.

15
00:01:59,35 --> 00:02:08,83
Assimilated into it all that much. You know there's a bit of. Bit of resentment and stuff left behind. Right ok.

16
00:02:10,89 --> 00:02:15,41
Probably a really vivid memory that i always have seen coming into.

17
00:02:15,51 --> 00:02:21,67
Name them when i was nine years old for the first time with my auntie and. Mother and cousins and people.

18
00:02:21,67 --> 00:02:26,2
And it was hot summer day really hot and dragonflies a buzzing around.

19
00:02:26,2 --> 00:02:29,88
And the one thing i could sense was the smells you know. You know what.

20
00:02:29,88 --> 00:02:34,25
Nimbin has this distinctive smell which is really different. It was a mixture of.

21
00:02:34,25 --> 00:02:44,48
Poor poor vision and grass and sort of. You know. Animals and sweat and and. You know. Feted human smells you know and.

22
00:02:44,48 --> 00:02:49,92
We just i've been up this big pool poor on this. And this watermelon on this type will. And i to.

23
00:02:49,92 --> 00:02:58,13
And it's just the sort of. It's my first memory of newman. Was from that time and.

24
00:02:58,13 --> 00:03:04,81
Other than that i've just got a sort of continuing. Memory from when i was young and. Of sun was up in x.

25
00:03:04,81 --> 00:03:12,85
Land which is sort of. Just blood and you've been wrong. You know. The images of some the strange and the cash shit.

26
00:03:12,85 --> 00:03:19,13
And the mud. And the insects and incense and things like that. And sort of.

27
00:03:19,13 --> 00:03:23,48
I think that belongs to childhood not i really can't recapture that anymore.

28
00:03:23,48 --> 00:03:38,09
Too much has happened since to be able to sort of retrieve that top of idyllic. Ideal feeling that. It was there. Well.

29
00:03:38,09 --> 00:03:43,89
I never consciously realised that my parents were different from anyone else's parents. And it was only.

30
00:03:43,89 --> 00:03:50,04
I only learnt it externally from other people and from other people sort of. Disparagement and.

31
00:03:50,04 --> 00:03:55,59
Which meant that when i got a primary school for example me for. I was only about nine. You know.

32
00:03:55,59 --> 00:04:00,46
I'm wearing a full moon for will jump out. Nothing underneath.

33
00:04:00,46 --> 00:04:08,35
You know big pair of baggy cotton pants and now into pens now underway no shoes. Long hair. Feathers and kids saying.

34
00:04:08,35 --> 00:04:09,84
You know. You know.

35
00:04:09,84 --> 00:04:15,41
Really being ostracized in school which was really bad and kids saying well you know do you have what she had.

36
00:04:15,51 --> 00:04:20,94
Do you brush your teeth you know. If you got a disease you know what languages do you speak type thing.

37
00:04:20,94 --> 00:04:27,22
And it was pretty bad for war. But i learned how to. I think actually what happened to our generation my generation.

38
00:04:27,22 --> 00:04:34,02
Is that after. After going through that original. Rejection time.

39
00:04:34,02 --> 00:04:38,5
By by out the peers we actually became much more conservative than our parents were.

40
00:04:38,5 --> 00:04:45,6
Which means that now we're sort of integrating back into sort of mainstream. A striving middle class.

41
00:04:45,6 --> 00:04:53,42
Technological society. There's a bit of it. There's a bit of a backlash actually. Which is pretty pretty big.

42
00:04:53,42 --> 00:05:01,31
You know i didn't go to the camo school. But my mom taught there for watermark a lot of friends from there.

43
00:05:01,31 --> 00:05:08,72
I started off in the central school which was always a stronghold of. You know. Dairy found the sons and daughters.

44
00:05:14,34 --> 00:05:27,79
Are not once or twice playground fights. Prejudice. Just general small minded. You know. Typically strain.

45
00:05:28,82 --> 00:05:32,39
Narrow minded thing but the thing about it was it was never too serious.

46
00:05:32,39 --> 00:05:36,03
You know nothing and nothing too bad at the happened.

47
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:41,74
It was just the ways that i was with the hippies and those with the good guys you know the cricket players and stuff.

48
00:05:41,74 --> 00:05:48,24
You're either cricket player or your hippie. And hippies didn't play balls or. Cricket or you know something.

49
00:05:48,24 --> 00:05:56,22
They went around sort of raiding herman hesse or. Burning incense or. You know talking about. Shit. Christian thing.

50
00:05:56,22 --> 00:06:04,76
But you know. But that sort of young kid sort of picking up symbols and images of themselves last bus.

51
00:06:09,49 --> 00:06:19,22
Well we were just always into we were into each other. Which is something i think a lot of other kids. When.

52
00:06:19,22 --> 00:06:27,17
We're into just discovering each other in a sort of pretty personal way. I just remember. You know sort of.

53
00:06:27,17 --> 00:06:32,29
Looking from school and going down to the river and swimming and stuff like that you know naked and spying secrets

54
00:06:32,29 --> 00:06:39,35
and later on smoking marijuana and girls and parties and sort of. It was.

55
00:06:39,35 --> 00:06:42,48
It was a way of life which we picked up from our parents because i suppose we.

56
00:06:42,48 --> 00:06:48,17
You know we imitate our parents more than anyone else. And. And that was just not.

57
00:06:48,17 --> 00:06:51,92
You know there was any group of about six of us or something that did that.

58
00:06:51,92 --> 00:07:10,95
And everyone else was pretty much into something bad beatles or something. Something else. Yeah do. I have.

59
00:07:10,95 --> 00:07:17,38
I haven't like. I actually when i first come up to name and. I've lived in paradise valley for about.

60
00:07:17,38 --> 00:07:22,93
About three months before my mum came up from sydney she was the working at a school down there.

61
00:07:22,93 --> 00:07:29,99
And i was living with this group of adults. Of whom my stepfather was one and. I really remember their.

62
00:07:29,99 --> 00:07:37,29
I pin this and their sort of generosity and their sort of feels in this you know that will sit around and just.

63
00:07:37,29 --> 00:07:45,73
I suppose it was a typical middle class top of. Adult gathering. Insofar as that they're all educated they've been any.

64
00:07:45,73 --> 00:07:49,99
Psychologists lectures teachers doctors. And they.

65
00:07:50,54 --> 00:07:58,17
But i i had a sense of togetherness which i really hadn't seen before in the city. You know. I've been brought up.

66
00:07:58,17 --> 00:08:02,98
Going to very schools in the city you know. My parents were sort of.

67
00:08:02,98 --> 00:08:08,08
Divorced when i was quite young and a lot type thing i was always used to. Displacement or disembodiment.

68
00:08:08,08 --> 00:08:15,41
Or something which was which was. I you know. Broken a path. And like me when i.

69
00:08:15,63 --> 00:08:19,56
First came to him in the first thing i saw amongst the adults was this.

70
00:08:19,56 --> 00:08:28,62
Cohesion and just a seriousness of purpose as well. An integrity that what they were doing.

71
00:08:28,62 --> 00:08:31,37
And yet i had a lot of fun too. You know.

72
00:08:31,37 --> 00:08:36,05
I mean it wasn't serious as nothing too serious about there was no big big you know.

73
00:08:36,05 --> 00:08:38,56
Bloody ross the system all big kamin see it over

74
00:08:38,56 --> 00:08:43,67
and i was just until people deciding to have a lot of fun in their lives you know.

75
00:08:43,67 --> 00:08:48,96
After going through the rat rights fees and and.

76
00:08:48,96 --> 00:09:05,7
I suppose that me my friends will pick up on that i mean we still laugh. Well. We've sort of.

77
00:09:05,7 --> 00:09:10,72
We've all moved on our own individual lives really like.

78
00:09:10,72 --> 00:09:15,75
A lot of my very close friends from paving from the early days. Have gone to uni.

79
00:09:15,75 --> 00:09:20,25
Like one of them has just graduated with honors in your apology to a new.

80
00:09:20,25 --> 00:09:25,11
He's off in england at the moment looking at uni's over there. Which is pretty impressive. You know.

81
00:09:25,11 --> 00:09:31,39
My sister is down in sydney. Finishing off an economics degree now and things and others of us are still up here.

82
00:09:31,39 --> 00:09:38,56
Like myself. Like luke who plays music or play music we. We do things are right. As well.

83
00:09:38,56 --> 00:09:42,34
And that's alright we sort of. I think really that.

84
00:09:42,34 --> 00:09:50,33
Nimbin didn't have such an impact on us that we were going to fall into one of it's types of categories whether it was

85
00:09:50,33 --> 00:09:55,46
get too far into drugs that we became junkies will become full on hippies or whatever we're going to do we.

86
00:09:55,46 --> 00:10:10,29
We followed our own paths. You know which were all different. Some of us have been back a few years. Differently.

87
00:10:10,29 --> 00:10:23,74
Absolutely. Well. The people who who are. I knew. As a kid who i now know to be. You know. Full on addicts.

88
00:10:25,16 --> 00:10:33,02
Quite seriously. Ruined by drugs by hard drugs were always a bit. A bit self destructive anyway and.

89
00:10:33,02 --> 00:10:37,87
Whether they're in yemen or wherever they were there in the streets or chippendale sorry hills or brunswick street

90
00:10:37,87 --> 00:10:41,87
or wherever they were. Those who talk to people who are going to get into that anyway.

91
00:10:41,87 --> 00:10:49,3
So i don't think there's always an argument that nimbin produces. The circumstances for people to become junkies but.

92
00:10:49,3 --> 00:10:59,18
I think that that. That. That's i don't post and choice. So i mean i i remember a girl who who was really amazing.

93
00:10:59,18 --> 00:11:04,77
And she. She taught me how to ride a horse. I knew a few years like the seventies or something.

94
00:11:04,77 --> 00:11:12,49
And last year i learned that she thought of a no team has been. And that. That really threw me a lot and.

95
00:11:12,49 --> 00:11:17,2
She didn't have any friends. She just couldn't handle it. So she died.

96
00:11:19,13 --> 00:11:26,98
And you know there's quite a few stories like that around. But then again there are people who are sort of.

97
00:11:26,98 --> 00:11:32,75
Not seen or heard of for quite a few years now and they've disappeared into the woodwork. And there's no there's no.

98
00:11:32,75 --> 00:11:37,00
Thing about nimbin this is no real support system for people who have gone into that type of thing.

99
00:11:38,14 --> 00:11:46,49
I don't know whether that should be a social concern or a hospital concern or sort of parents' concern

100
00:11:46,49 --> 00:11:53,77
but for all the kids who are out there on their own and homeless. There's no real support system for them.

101
00:11:53,77 --> 00:12:15,41
And that's pretty sad. You know. It's pretty bad. Marijuana fitted into. Into the usual young. Simian rebellious semi.

102
00:12:15,95 --> 00:12:20,72
Celebration resort of thing about. You know just being out there and going.

103
00:12:20,72 --> 00:12:23,87
Getting away from your parents without hippies or bureaucrats or businessmen

104
00:12:23,87 --> 00:12:27,76
or whatever they were getting away from them getting away from school.

105
00:12:27,76 --> 00:12:32,35
Getting away from your own ambitions whatever it is and having a good time with your friends.

106
00:12:32,35 --> 00:12:37,01
And it was never a serious thing for me. I mean i haven't smoked for a long time.

107
00:12:37,01 --> 00:12:45,74
And lot of my friends have any that they selected to go. The line. When they finish high school and. It does change.

108
00:12:45,74 --> 00:12:53,54
It does sort of affect affect your development. In certain ways it opens you up to different.

109
00:12:53,54 --> 00:12:58,24
Different thoughts and different ways of looking at things but then again it's. It's like any drug it's recreational.

110
00:12:58,24 --> 00:13:06,15
It's. If you have too much of it it's not good for you. You know. So marijuana use.

111
00:13:06,15 --> 00:13:14,99
The thing about marijuana there was lots of people going to dealing. Which is pretty. I was. I was sort of.

112
00:13:14,99 --> 00:13:20,43
Was critical of that. Because i thought it was a bit. You know better things to do than get into dealing marijuana.

113
00:13:20,43 --> 00:13:26,5
And they're still doing it. And i think that's a destructive force in my own peace you know my own sort of generation.

114
00:13:27,49 --> 00:13:34,2
But you know. Again that's the choice. And sort of. I can't. I find it hard to be able to justify a lot of people's.

115
00:13:34,2 --> 00:13:35,75
Reasons for doing things.

116
00:13:35,75 --> 00:13:42,63
I couldn't put it down to it being their choice so marijuana is something that all of us experience that people do

117
00:13:42,63 --> 00:13:47,72
experience everywhere. Wherever they are. And it's a great it's a great thing it's like.

118
00:13:47,72 --> 00:13:56,55
It's like anything it's like the joys of life you know. And it's just it's just a matter of abuse and acceptance.

119
00:13:56,55 --> 00:14:15,41
I suppose. Yes absolutely absolutely. When i remember that when i was eighteen. I was fully into drama. Right.

120
00:14:15,64 --> 00:14:21,33
Why but drama was it. And i remember just reading shakespeare and reading all of the cars.

121
00:14:21,33 --> 00:14:29,38
And what we decide to do is to start up a new drama troupe. You know just of young kids promise school educates and.

122
00:14:29,38 --> 00:14:37,1
I remember we put on about two productions a very sings light off and you learn. People like that and.

123
00:14:37,1 --> 00:14:44,58
Our member writing two plays. Really funny little. Sort of plays. About just about us i suppose.

124
00:14:44,58 --> 00:14:50,35
And we actually put the morning town. You know. Audiences came in those drinks and wine and cheese and.

125
00:14:50,35 --> 00:14:53,24
Music and it was really good. And that happened.

126
00:14:53,24 --> 00:14:57,01
You know probably when i was eleven and twelve which is young time for that to happen.

127
00:14:57,01 --> 00:15:02,41
There was also a classical music side which i played out every week. Which was really good for furthering you know.

128
00:15:03,22 --> 00:15:12,22
Mine and everyone else's musical. Sort of skill or practice or whatever you know. We used to sort of. And have weekly.

129
00:15:12,22 --> 00:15:17,73
Gatherings at the town hall. And about eight o'clock on sunday nights. And just play music. House.

130
00:15:17,73 --> 00:15:21,36
People sit around in questions and i'd get up and play some clarinet.

131
00:15:21,36 --> 00:15:27,82
Sinatra and my sis to play the chill live in mother play the piano and. It was really good. It was very informal.

132
00:15:27,82 --> 00:15:32,82
I mean i'm sure squeaking the whole time. You know. That was acceptable.

133
00:15:32,82 --> 00:15:39,15
Yeah so definitely there was a lot of a lot of help in us.

134
00:15:39,15 --> 00:15:43,99
As far as getting us into our own thing was concerned you know whether it was musical.

135
00:15:43,99 --> 00:15:46,97
Skateboarding or whatever the hell it was you know it was all. Wise.

136
00:15:46,97 --> 00:15:49,7
All right to be doing those things you know you didn't have to be going off

137
00:15:49,7 --> 00:15:55,1
and achieving what school you have to be you know.

138
00:15:55,1 --> 00:16:00,6
Fulfilling the expectations of your grandparents or or your parents or teachers or whatever it was.

139
00:16:00,6 --> 00:16:07,24
It was always very much an individual orientated thing. I don't know where that was more so than anywhere else.

140
00:16:07,24 --> 00:16:38,28
But it seemed that way. That's really true not only is it a challenge. It's a year. It's. Being in nimbin.

141
00:16:38,28 --> 00:16:45,39
And feeling the need to break out of nimbin. And go to the city. And achieve something else is not only a challenge.

142
00:16:45,39 --> 00:16:51,63
It. It's also a very difficult thing to do emotionally. Because once you've been up here.

143
00:16:51,63 --> 00:16:55,00
If you've been up here for as long as i have which is more than ten years.

144
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:01,34
You become really attached to what is basically a paradise. And you begin to wonder will.

145
00:17:01,34 --> 00:17:06,53
Is there really need to go to the city is there really need to get a degree is there a need to achieve something

146
00:17:06,53 --> 00:17:12,19
and become a sort of working. Functioning member of a sort of open society.

147
00:17:12,19 --> 00:17:16,41
And you really think now there isn't a need for that. But yes it's a challenge.

148
00:17:16,41 --> 00:17:22,23
And it's a nice challenge but i think even supplies will come back to you know.

149
00:17:22,23 --> 00:17:38,62
Over time will be coming back i've always come back here. Ferals. I don't remember there always being ferals actually.

150
00:17:38,62 --> 00:17:47,62
I think. Feral seems to be one of the lightest phases of existential billion with the with. Comes from. It's from punk.

151
00:17:47,62 --> 00:17:57,24
From skinhead from from whatever. I don't really. I just think that farrel's.

152
00:17:57,24 --> 00:18:02,1
It's important for whoever decides to become that that. Out. Lee.

153
00:18:02,1 --> 00:18:04,46
Contemptuous of everything learns how to integrate at some point.

154
00:18:04,84 --> 00:18:08,09
And the fact is that all of the ferals do people for government.

155
00:18:08,09 --> 00:18:12,79
Which isn't isn't a bad thing or anything but you know. That's how we work our society but.

156
00:18:12,79 --> 00:18:17,36
It'd be nice if one day they. They learned how to my own nature or something and they set up workshops and they sold.

157
00:18:17,82 --> 00:18:25,32
Surely they sold handcrafts all. So close to something like that because at the moment they're really quite there.

158
00:18:25,32 --> 00:18:39,4
Even there be exported to there. Why not. I don't i've never really had any interaction with ferals apart from.

159
00:18:39,4 --> 00:18:42,99
Mating the minute. In a crate all getting stoned with them was something.

160
00:18:42,99 --> 00:18:47,94
I think they're just fun loving people who just want to have a good time. But it's a juvenile type of thing.

161
00:18:48,75 --> 00:19:02,36
It's an important thing but it's juvenile and i think it's something that had to grow out of eventually. Well.

162
00:19:02,36 --> 00:19:08,82
The boys seemed to sort of revolve around. Around what's happening drug wise. Ah.

163
00:19:08,82 --> 00:19:14,52
That sounds like a general statement but at first it was always just the pace loving he.

164
00:19:15,22 --> 00:19:21,21
You know stereotypical sixty's american images of he who who really just wanted to live peacefully on a calming smoke.

165
00:19:21,21 --> 00:19:29,59
Your joint. Right smack a mean cocaine mean. All this stuff you know. Designer drugs are in there now.

166
00:19:29,59 --> 00:19:32,19
And people changing. You know.

167
00:19:32,19 --> 00:19:37,51
You get sort of yuppie middle class suburbanites from brisbane will see me coming up

168
00:19:37,51 --> 00:19:46,71
and down to to buy their trucks here setting up new businesses and. And what have you so newman's lost its original.

169
00:19:46,71 --> 00:19:54,54
Idealistic sort of cohesion it. And it's become a bit disparate. And a bit sort of a bit scattered in that way.

170
00:19:54,54 --> 00:19:59,69
You know. It's the drug culture has. Has given such a commercial center.

171
00:19:59,69 --> 00:20:04,57
As far as business is concerned that there's no real social conscience anymore.

172
00:20:04,57 --> 00:20:10,44
And that's sad because you can see it in the street and you can see it in the people but at the same time.

173
00:20:10,44 --> 00:20:12,93
It's becoming much more neary. And it's.

174
00:20:12,93 --> 00:20:19,18
It's turning into a pretty peaceful middle class hamlet at the same time where. Whereby you've got.

175
00:20:19,18 --> 00:20:25,03
Families who aren't into drugs at. Or aren't into anything to alternative coming up.

176
00:20:25,03 --> 00:20:32,11
Having kids living in actually living really pays full and. You know make a logical sound and happy lives.

177
00:20:32,11 --> 00:20:37,14
Out in the hills you know. I suppose they aren't farming fully conscious. But it's not.

178
00:20:37,14 --> 00:20:39,76
It's not a self-conscious thing like it was in the early guys.

179
00:20:40,09 --> 00:20:40,89
And that's really good

180
00:20:40,89 --> 00:20:45,88
and i think the more of that that happens everywhere on the straight the better because it needn't be.

181
00:20:45,88 --> 00:20:53,12
The sudden or revolutionary or or. Aggressive towards the old settlers there. Like it was in seventy three.

182
00:20:53,12 --> 00:20:56,11
But it can be integrated into the mainstream society.

183
00:20:56,3 --> 00:21:01,74
You know which simply just means learning how to live with with an awareness about what you're doing with your rubbish.

184
00:21:01,85 --> 00:21:06,15
You know where you put in a plastic. Where you put in your bottles. Where you're putting the sheet.

185
00:21:06,87 --> 00:21:13,01
You know working out how you can use you use your own land. For the most you know. Most convenient purposes and.

186
00:21:13,01 --> 00:21:16,37
Efficient purposes without destroying what you've got which is what perma culture is all about.

187
00:21:16,37 --> 00:21:18,33
And that started off here.

188
00:21:18,33 --> 00:21:24,98
And learning about the social the social sort of relevance of that as far as your kids are concerned and.

189
00:21:24,98 --> 00:21:31,06
What school to send them to all things like that. You know. And that's that's where nimbin has its strengths now.

190
00:21:31,06 --> 00:21:38,35
It doesn't have it in the old. Nostalgic. Yearnings of the dugout paypal it's got it in the.

191
00:21:38,35 --> 00:21:45,29
Hard working conscious and yet mainstream. Middle class trend it's been happening in the last five years.

192
00:21:45,29 --> 00:21:49,59
And other than that other than the sort of. Other than the yuppie drug scene in the.

193
00:21:49,59 --> 00:21:53,14
And the middle class families saying child put it.

194
00:21:53,14 --> 00:21:59,41
I can't really think of there being any other one just rent there's always the rebellious.

195
00:21:59,41 --> 00:22:04,28
Clique from sydney from newtown from glee. Who decide to come up and check nimbin out.

196
00:22:04,28 --> 00:22:08,05
But it's usually be too slow and they end up going back. Back home to sydney.

197
00:22:08,05 --> 00:22:15,34
Or the others there's a bit of an aboriginal community developing as well which is good because i always.

198
00:22:15,34 --> 00:22:20,4
I always noticed. Conspicuously that there weren't many aboriginals in yemen. And there they were.

199
00:22:20,85 --> 00:22:26,34
And they're actually getting land for example there's a. There's quite a large community at the base of nimbin rocks.

200
00:22:26,34 --> 00:22:29,67
Who have reclaimed their land and it's their land. And they all lived there.

201
00:22:29,67 --> 00:22:32,25
And it's really good and they're quite happy in.

202
00:22:32,25 --> 00:22:36,5
And everyone interacts with them and i enjoy it with us and it's really good. So it's you know.

203
00:22:36,5 --> 00:22:42,67
It's pretty much all be one family. As far as they're concerned now which is good.

204
00:22:42,67 --> 00:23:01,98
Apart from that i can only think of any other. So cultural trend that's taking place in human. Well it's.

205
00:23:01,98 --> 00:23:08,73
There are a few. There are a few of us who've decided to do that but it's much less. Self consciously alternative.

206
00:23:08,73 --> 00:23:16,26
Than what our parents who are the basically people who who want to settle down. Have families if they can leave.

207
00:23:16,26 --> 00:23:23,16
You know leaving their out house if i can afford that. But they're also basically people who are still trying for some.

208
00:23:23,16 --> 00:23:29,22
Some sort of occupation you haven't got any any real. Livelihood. Yet.

209
00:23:29,81 --> 00:23:36,09
And so they're not really getting into perm culture and not really getting into. Into. Hippiedom.

210
00:23:36,09 --> 00:23:39,77
As such what they getting into is just staying up here rather than going to city.

211
00:23:40,34 --> 00:23:43,02
So i don't know whether that's a regressive step what it is i think it's.

212
00:23:43,02 --> 00:23:49,44
It really matters to make a judgment on that level but. But they're. They're much more ordinary that things you know.

213
00:23:49,93 --> 00:23:55,00
And most of the moment all you know all be getting that all in a couple of months or something.

214
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:01,95
After a while to thirteen weeks but yeah it sort of there's a lot of. There's a lot of.

215
00:24:01,95 --> 00:24:06,26
Pull towards just staying sort of going and.

216
00:24:06,26 --> 00:24:11,62
I think it'll change i think over the next few decades name them will become so much more of an ordinary place.

217
00:24:12,18 --> 00:24:21,56
You know. A kind. It will become pretty much a country town with. With different tendency. He's now.

218
00:24:21,56 --> 00:24:45,37
And that's about it. Well. I think it's a very simple thing which is that when you've been exposed to.

219
00:24:45,37 --> 00:24:49,31
Such a wide variety of different life. Lifestyle options.

220
00:24:51,00 --> 00:24:56,52
You know it comes as no surprise that what you would naturally get. Is is a wide and.

221
00:24:56,52 --> 00:24:58,78
Open and accepting

222
00:24:58,78 --> 00:25:06,6
and tolerating view of society as a whole which i suppose on a personal level means that that having been brought up in

223
00:25:06,6 --> 00:25:12,99
sydney as a young kid. And sort of going to private schools. Until i was seven or six or whatever.

224
00:25:12,99 --> 00:25:18,62
You know it's a close type of life it's a close lifestyle it's very much a middle class protected.

225
00:25:18,62 --> 00:25:29,09
Financially secure conservative type of wives. Of living. Coming up here just opened me up to a completely different.

226
00:25:29,09 --> 00:25:29,73
Freedom.

227
00:25:29,73 --> 00:25:36,16
Which which and fortunately lot of people in this country haven't got the opportunity to to experience you know.

228
00:25:37,4 --> 00:25:48,24
And so it's a living. Growing up up here has opened me to a whole different range of spiritual practices.

229
00:25:48,24 --> 00:25:49,46
And i mean you know.

230
00:25:49,46 --> 00:25:57,41
The simple fact that there is there's a krishna krishna sort of settlement in the will and bar that there's so much.

231
00:25:57,41 --> 00:26:02,14
There's so much and discipline which is seriously followed up here.

232
00:26:02,14 --> 00:26:06,15
Is is impressive you know to a young person to a young person's impressionable mind.

233
00:26:06,89 --> 00:26:10,86
And that's something which i just know. Wouldn't have been an issue. In sydney.

234
00:26:10,86 --> 00:26:16,51
And i can see it now because i had friends in sydney when i was a kid and. And i still know them. And we've grown up.

235
00:26:16,51 --> 00:26:21,39
Parallel although they've grown up down there i've grown up here and they. And this sort of.

236
00:26:21,39 --> 00:26:22,1
Into what they're doing

237
00:26:22,1 --> 00:26:28,46
but they're very commercially oriented they're very consumer oriented they're much more into finding out.

238
00:26:28,46 --> 00:26:37,65
What money they can get hold of whatever they can they're into urban types of. Types of hobby. While i was doing.

239
00:26:37,65 --> 00:26:41,83
Drama or something up here that we're doing sky boarding in the streets of manly whatever you know.

240
00:26:41,83 --> 00:26:46,34
While i was smoking marijuana that were probably taking ecstasy or designer drugs you know and stuff.

241
00:26:46,34 --> 00:26:54,96
It's just a different type of slant on things. One is a bit more competitive in rat race than the other.

242
00:26:54,96 --> 00:27:01,12
And each have this sort of negative tendencies in their positive tendencies. But i think that the mere fact that.

243
00:27:01,12 --> 00:27:05,51
Being up here for so long and experiencing the different types of people i have up here.

244
00:27:05,51 --> 00:27:17,52
If you know of his many years i have mains that may and. Young people like myself. Have got quite a wide and accepting.

245
00:27:17,52 --> 00:27:28,02
A more educated you're more informed about about a strange society. And it's sort of subcultures as a whole you know.

246
00:27:28,81 --> 00:27:31,09
It's a. It's a general sort of statement i think.

247
00:27:31,09 --> 00:27:49,34
I think the wider view you have the more the more informed you are about your society. Well.

248
00:27:49,88 --> 00:27:56,26
Well it is totally confusing the thing about the spiritual. Sort of a thought that is playing around in these hills.

249
00:27:56,26 --> 00:28:03,25
Is that people become very self-indulgent and they become quite self preoccupied.

250
00:28:03,25 --> 00:28:06,95
Which is which i suppose it's all right for an individual in some part of his life

251
00:28:06,95 --> 00:28:13,35
but in the end you've got to get down to the real the real hard work. Digging the shit. And.

252
00:28:13,35 --> 00:28:16,55
And so you know what you probably see up here is a lot of.

253
00:28:16,55 --> 00:28:21,69
Of quite precious people going around spouting forth their little philosophies. But see that's.

254
00:28:21,69 --> 00:28:26,57
You know that's what it's all about you've got to have somewhere in the country that does that not everyone can be out.

255
00:28:26,57 --> 00:28:28,46
Being business executives or something.

256
00:28:28,46 --> 00:28:32,85
You know knowing their fast buck you know someone's going to be delivering their philosophies however how.

257
00:28:32,85 --> 00:28:41,08
Like they may be. So that's what it's like up here you know and it's good because in the end it is confusing.

258
00:28:41,08 --> 00:28:45,46
You know it is confusing there's a lot of stuff that's going around and three. You know.

259
00:28:45,46 --> 00:28:50,89
Especially before you've developed your own firm beliefs about the world.

260
00:28:50,89 --> 00:28:56,77
It's hard to know which are really where it's i don't know. You know. A lot of them they just real crap.

261
00:28:56,77 --> 00:29:06,25
And a lot of them are quite quite inspiring. So i mean there's a lot of. You've got you've got a cult has.

262
00:29:06,25 --> 00:29:13,64
Transcendental yogis set on these side issues all those people out there doing what i do. And i suppose.

263
00:29:13,64 --> 00:29:27,28
You witness it. And you observe and you appreciate it and you take a choice. Here. Do i have one.

264
00:29:27,28 --> 00:29:36,5
Look like this many stupid u.p.i. Do is i really can't choose or now. I really can't think of one.

265
00:29:36,5 --> 00:30:11,58
I can't think of one. A funny name in story. I can't. It's hard to think. Think of an author like him. Will.

266
00:30:11,58 --> 00:30:14,2
From a from me.

267
00:30:14,2 --> 00:30:21,35
The real the real beauty in the real importance about living up here is being the natural the natural abundance of the

268
00:30:21,35 --> 00:30:27,63
life which has meant that over the years of our. Really learned how to how to live out there and.

269
00:30:27,63 --> 00:30:34,99
You know which which included. Trips walking. Dyce cross not cat range. Ridge.

270
00:30:34,99 --> 00:30:41,4
From from the him being here to the to the bison. The mound in the hills. You know which meant. Sort of.

271
00:30:41,4 --> 00:30:46,13
Getting on my horse with some friends in for three days camping in writing from here through the forest up to the bison

272
00:30:46,13 --> 00:30:50,19
the pinnacle over there which you can see. You know which. Which meant.

273
00:30:50,19 --> 00:30:55,4
Just being so inspired by the landscape that i'd go out and buy a canvas and paints to try and paint what i could say.

274
00:30:56,31 --> 00:31:04,26
Pretty poorly probably. But it's. You know it's just such an inspiring thing to be in you know having.

275
00:31:04,26 --> 00:31:10,45
Having the opportunity to go down to hangar falls. Every week and swim down there in this amazing.

276
00:31:10,45 --> 00:31:17,99
Natural water for well. And all of that. It's just it's amazing thing to be able to do. As a kid.

277
00:31:17,99 --> 00:31:21,4
When you're growing up and i really i do pity a lot of.

278
00:31:21,4 --> 00:31:26,12
A lot of people who who just haven't known that part that part about a stride

279
00:31:26,12 --> 00:31:33,23
or that part about being out in the country. And sort of hippiedom. And drug culture and all of that is around.

280
00:31:33,54 --> 00:31:35,76
But for me it always lies at.
