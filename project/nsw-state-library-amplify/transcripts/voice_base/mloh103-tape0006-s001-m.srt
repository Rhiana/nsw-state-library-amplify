1
00:00:20,01 --> 00:00:43,09
So. Oh. Jobs. We rise. Ok. Ok. Mine's joshua masson and. I first came to nimbin.

2
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:49,47
When i was about two years old i came out with my parents from england and. We arrived in western australia.

3
00:00:49,47 --> 00:00:54,95
And travelled right the way across the country. My parents were basically. Searching for an alternative lifestyle.

4
00:00:54,95 --> 00:01:01,78
What they'd experienced when they were my age. In and and. They ended up in nimbin. And.

5
00:01:01,78 --> 00:01:07,08
I was sort of directed out to the. Kamin there. And we ended up staying in the area for about ten years.

6
00:01:08,5 --> 00:01:12,61
What do you know these days. Well the earliest thing i remember.

7
00:01:12,61 --> 00:01:16,86
Was intolerable falls when we were living in this kind of.

8
00:01:16,86 --> 00:01:19,36
Well i suppose you could call it a house it was a wooden platform.

9
00:01:19,36 --> 00:01:23,03
With a big old army tent and a sort of light construction over the top of it

10
00:01:23,03 --> 00:01:28,85
and struggling to get it built in the wet season. You know. Ticks and rain and all the rest of it.

11
00:01:28,85 --> 00:01:34,49
And i just remember having complete freedom to sort of swim in the creek and run around there and.

12
00:01:34,49 --> 00:01:40,35
You know there are a lot of other young kids my age. Sort of. Just learning to. Adventure around.

13
00:01:40,35 --> 00:01:47,38
The whole place and it was fantastic i disremember running around you know in the sun on tumble.

14
00:01:47,38 --> 00:01:57,06
Is not really what you want. I suppose. I would. I would have swapped. A little bit of.

15
00:01:57,06 --> 00:02:02,91
The actual security of knowing that you have a completely secure home.

16
00:02:02,91 --> 00:02:08,17
Because we did move around quite a bit and a lot of the drawings that were living in were pretty kind of makeshift.

17
00:02:08,17 --> 00:02:11,62
From time to time. But then again. You know. There are a lot of sort of.

18
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:13,97
Advantages that come along with that as well because you know.

19
00:02:13,97 --> 00:02:16,41
I always felt that i was part of a larger community and stuff like that.

20
00:02:16,46 --> 00:02:30,08
And i definitely wouldn't have swapped any of them. So. You do so. How did you realize. You know. Well it was.

21
00:02:31,12 --> 00:02:37,37
I suppose i felt like i was part of a larger community because we were also sort of. Involved in the same things like.

22
00:02:37,37 --> 00:02:42,57
My family and all of the other families and people there were all sort of hen building their houses.

23
00:02:42,57 --> 00:02:44,63
And all facing the problems of. All you know.

24
00:02:44,63 --> 00:02:49,97
Of food and community living and stuff like that together and so like our saw adults.

25
00:02:49,97 --> 00:02:54,15
Interacting in a different way to what you see them in mainstream society and.

26
00:02:54,15 --> 00:03:00,85
That was reflected in the children as well that we sort of stayed together. As a larger group. A lot more and.

27
00:03:00,85 --> 00:03:05,87
Sort of did a lot more. Of sort of daily activities together and.

28
00:03:05,87 --> 00:03:11,84
This was my experience of it was jest as feeling that. All of the adults around me were a part of my family and.

29
00:03:11,84 --> 00:03:17,00
You know even faces that i only just recognized i knew that i could trust because of the way that i'd seen them.

30
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:21,29
Living around me. And the same with all the children and i found it very easy to make.

31
00:03:21,29 --> 00:03:27,91
And play with a lot of different children because i knew that we were all just part of this sort of big farm together.

32
00:03:27,91 --> 00:03:33,99
So i was a different. Well. Well.

33
00:03:33,99 --> 00:03:39,31
My education in was interesting because i spent some time in the alternative schools there. But then.

34
00:03:39,31 --> 00:03:42,62
I also spent most of my primary school years at the straight school.

35
00:03:42,62 --> 00:03:46,21
As it was called which was like the newman central school and.

36
00:03:46,39 --> 00:03:51,64
It was at a time when children from the alternative families and the hippie settlers around the place.

37
00:03:51,64 --> 00:03:57,09
Were starting to go to the. Sort of central school. And those starting to actually be interaction between.

38
00:03:57,09 --> 00:03:59,92
The hippie kids and the straight kids and.

39
00:03:59,92 --> 00:04:05,28
You can imagine it was quite a kind of intense sort of thing that was going on within the classrooms because there's a

40
00:04:05,28 --> 00:04:10,49
lot of contention between them. Which i suppose was just a reflection of the tension in the whole community.

41
00:04:10,49 --> 00:04:16,41
But that tension between us. Sort of. Dissipated. We actually got our acts together.

42
00:04:16,51 --> 00:04:21,55
Over the years that i was in primary school. And it was a really interesting thing because i remember at like.

43
00:04:21,55 --> 00:04:29,26
You know in years one and two and three. Feeling very sort of threatened and intimidated by the. Straight kids and.

44
00:04:29,26 --> 00:04:32,13
Very separate from them. And then over the years.

45
00:04:32,13 --> 00:04:35,71
And actually everything became a lot more relaxed and a lot more positive and.

46
00:04:35,71 --> 00:04:40,95
By the end of that time there was actually a real lot of positive stuff happening. And.

47
00:04:40,95 --> 00:04:47,01
It was funny because i didn't see as much of that. In the adult community as i did. Among the kids. And so you know.

48
00:04:47,01 --> 00:04:55,33
It was i suppose that was a kind of a special thing that was going on in those laws of the vision. Was that of.

49
00:04:57,75 --> 00:05:06,9
What we hear is a difference. Well all of the straight kids felt as though the hippie children in their school.

50
00:05:06,9 --> 00:05:12,16
Were sort of dirty and. Weren't as sort of. Refined as.

51
00:05:12,16 --> 00:05:17,73
Them and didn't have a christian upbringing was a very important part of it and.

52
00:05:17,73 --> 00:05:21,23
Also kind of felt that their parents and. That they as well.

53
00:05:21,23 --> 00:05:25,82
Were an intrusion into the kind of routine and the pattern that had been set up in that area.

54
00:05:25,82 --> 00:05:29,93
And i suppose in a way that's rightly so because we are playing in what used to be their playgrounds

55
00:05:29,93 --> 00:05:34,16
and their older brothers playgrounds and stuff like that but.

56
00:05:34,16 --> 00:05:39,62
I suppose as the years went by and they realized that we could be just as much fun. And just as creative.

57
00:05:39,62 --> 00:05:45,54
And just as kind of. Into sport and into all those things that they are into. Or that started to break away.

58
00:05:45,54 --> 00:05:48,63
And i remember sort of. In my year in particular.

59
00:05:48,63 --> 00:05:53,33
Every time we all went on an excursion together all did something that brought us together. All of that stuff.

60
00:05:53,33 --> 00:06:00,23
Started to break down. And i suppose. You know. It did break down a lot faster. Among us than i did among the adults.

61
00:06:00,23 --> 00:06:04,35
And you know. We would have parties and i remember having parties myself.

62
00:06:04,35 --> 00:06:09,01
Where straight kids would come over and they would look different and speak differently and all that kind of stuff.

63
00:06:09,01 --> 00:06:12,71
And they would kind of tentatively walk into our house and see all of the sort of hippie ornaments

64
00:06:12,71 --> 00:06:16,41
and stuff like that around the place. And just be absolutely fascinated that they were.

65
00:06:16,44 --> 00:06:18,00
We are allowed to go inside that.

66
00:06:18,00 --> 00:06:23,93
When their parents were so hesitant about having anything to do with that part of the community and. You know.

67
00:06:23,93 --> 00:06:29,52
They were actually quite proud of themselves that they were able to go and you know participate without us

68
00:06:29,52 --> 00:06:34,81
and to let us into their lives as well because you know it was something that their parents just weren't able to do

69
00:06:34,81 --> 00:06:41,08
and i mean i go to meetings now. And i'm nineteen years old and. I see all of the faces of those straight kids parents.

70
00:06:41,08 --> 00:06:44,83
And it's still just a wall of resistance you know. And i remember. Sort of. Ten years ago.

71
00:06:45,56 --> 00:06:50,29
Breaking through that wall with all those kids and having a great time with them. But now. You know.

72
00:06:50,29 --> 00:07:00,47
It's just there are some things in that community. That will never change you know. Is there anything. You know.

73
00:07:00,47 --> 00:07:15,79
My roots. To. I suppose. Among the adults the thing that i remember. Is walking up see.

74
00:07:15,79 --> 00:07:23,41
We lived in a house just behind. Craft gallery in town there for quite a long time. We had the house for ten years and.

75
00:07:23,41 --> 00:07:26,34
I remember walking up at night time and.

76
00:07:26,34 --> 00:07:31,78
Just saying the kind of things that were going on in the streets there and a lot of them i didn't really understand.

77
00:07:31,78 --> 00:07:37,82
But i could actually say. The mechanism between the straits and the hippies at work. And you know i would say.

78
00:07:37,82 --> 00:07:40,94
A bunch of really aggressive kind of. You know people.

79
00:07:40,94 --> 00:07:46,27
Run across from the rainbow cafe and punch in the windows of the pub. And then run away.

80
00:07:46,27 --> 00:07:49,97
And all of this try to come running out of the pub. You know around closing time.

81
00:07:49,97 --> 00:07:55,21
And fight with these people in the straight muscle that happening a lot. And you know. It was a kind of.

82
00:07:55,21 --> 00:08:01,6
Two sides of the street. Type of thing going on for quite a while and i just remember. You know.

83
00:08:01,6 --> 00:08:05,84
Hearing a lot of complaints about the way the straights lived in the town.

84
00:08:05,84 --> 00:08:10,73
From from the alternative people that the noise from the pub. And the alcohol and all that kind of stuff and.

85
00:08:10,73 --> 00:08:16,41
You know those kind of criticisms were just as strong as the criticisms from straight people. About you know.

86
00:08:16,77 --> 00:08:20,4
Smoking grass in the straight and stuff like that as well. And so as far as you know.

87
00:08:20,4 --> 00:08:23,95
You asked me about criticisms and straight away i am talking about the drug issue there and.

88
00:08:23,95 --> 00:08:36,92
You know since we were everything leads to a dozen or so. This is the absolutely. Because you know. Like i am.

89
00:08:36,92 --> 00:08:43,95
There was a lot of hypocrisy in terms of those two sides of the community criticizing each other because you've got all

90
00:08:43,95 --> 00:08:46,83
of you know. All of these strikes in town at night.

91
00:08:46,83 --> 00:08:49,97
Getting really really drunk in the pub and playing a lot of really loud music.

92
00:08:49,97 --> 00:08:55,4
And getting aggressive and violent and tearing up and down in their cars and that type of thing. And then.

93
00:08:55,4 --> 00:08:58,28
Their wives and their families.

94
00:08:58,28 --> 00:09:03,00
Criticizing the alternative community for smoking drugs in the straight and for that disrupting their community.

95
00:09:03,00 --> 00:09:07,98
And yet the community. We're talking about. You know it had a very sort of destructive face to it as well.

96
00:09:07,98 --> 00:09:12,61
And i remember. You know on the straight kids. There was you know a lot of kind of guns and.

97
00:09:12,61 --> 00:09:17,11
A lot of violence and a lot of sort of stories about domestic violence and stuff like that

98
00:09:17,11 --> 00:09:21,24
and it was all very scary to me. Just the same way that. Among the straight families.

99
00:09:21,24 --> 00:09:27,35
You know the whole idea of kind of smoking dope in your family and. And sort of. You know people hanging around naked.

100
00:09:27,35 --> 00:09:44,84
On your community. Must have been very scary to them. So what was of these images. What was your thesis. Where. Well.

101
00:09:44,84 --> 00:09:50,79
The whole thing about where lighting to other adults. In a similar way to how you do with your parents and.

102
00:09:50,79 --> 00:09:57,48
You know sort of feeling that. That feeling of trust and feeling comfortable around a whole community of people.

103
00:09:57,48 --> 00:10:03,92
And spending a lot of time. Of family situations at other people's places and stuff like that and.

104
00:10:03,92 --> 00:10:05,62
Also feeling as though.

105
00:10:05,62 --> 00:10:10,58
Not just your house is the safe place in the world but like the whole community is somewhere where you belong.

106
00:10:10,58 --> 00:10:15,62
And that. You know you can kind of wonder among all those different people and still feel at home.

107
00:10:15,62 --> 00:10:18,65
And i think that was the main. Thing because i noticed. You know.

108
00:10:18,65 --> 00:10:23,13
Among the straight kids that they had a very kind of territorial thing about their mom and their dad.

109
00:10:23,13 --> 00:10:34,18
And their family and. I sort of just really never felt there was absolutely because i mean you know.

110
00:10:34,18 --> 00:10:39,7
My parents still played just as powerful a role in my life because this is there was also this whole sort of added

111
00:10:39,7 --> 00:10:44,91
security of knowing that you know. You were a part of this kind of.

112
00:10:44,91 --> 00:10:50,01
Maining full thing going on all around you and all those people celebrated together and work together

113
00:10:50,01 --> 00:10:55,04
and all that kind of stuff and you know. Just that. That feeling of assurance was.

114
00:10:55,04 --> 00:11:16,67
That was what i feel surrounded by my whole childhood. You know growing up in the. I mean. Looking to the. You know.

115
00:11:18,83 --> 00:11:24,71
I think. I learned a lot about being open minded to people's points of view and being.

116
00:11:24,71 --> 00:11:30,24
Exception of people's limitations and stuff like that and i think i learned about.

117
00:11:30,24 --> 00:11:35,48
Sort of listening to people and being compassionate. To people's kind of.

118
00:11:35,48 --> 00:11:39,99
Predicament or the people situation and so rather than. Always having a kind of.

119
00:11:39,99 --> 00:11:43,91
You know motivated sort of point of view about things where you've got something to prove

120
00:11:43,91 --> 00:11:46,8
or you've made a decision how you feel about things.

121
00:11:46,8 --> 00:11:52,05
To actually sort of let things flow a bit more and to to see situations change and come and go.

122
00:11:52,05 --> 00:11:55,15
And to be a bit more accepting of that kind of thing. And i don't know.

123
00:11:55,15 --> 00:12:01,34
You know how much it's actually rubbed off politically or anything like that but i would say that you know.

124
00:12:01,34 --> 00:12:07,64
Just in terms of kind of social situations and stuff like that. I think a little bit more easygoing. About.

125
00:12:07,64 --> 00:12:11,42
You know about that type of thing. It's hard to actually explain.

126
00:12:11,42 --> 00:12:17,56
You know the way that those values affect your behavior now. Because you know. It's pretty much you. Visible to me.

127
00:12:17,56 --> 00:12:20,34
And i don't feel. I don't feel different. To all of the.

128
00:12:20,34 --> 00:12:26,43
You know people in mainstream society that i'm relating to now. But sometimes i feel as though i'm a little bit ready.

129
00:12:26,43 --> 00:12:30,06
More ready to be open minded and to graph situations for they are.

130
00:12:30,06 --> 00:12:35,11
Than people who have got a whole load of kind of preconceived ideas that they've been taught in a very linear way from

131
00:12:35,11 --> 00:12:51,81
their family and their parents. So we're well. They weren't the only the only sort of. Finding situations.

132
00:12:51,81 --> 00:12:55,99
That i can remember were sort of up in town. Late at night.

133
00:12:55,99 --> 00:13:02,54
When you know there was sort of violence going on around me and. I felt really kind of afraid.

134
00:13:02,54 --> 00:13:08,95
And i remember sometimes. Sort of out. At the bush holes when they'd have big dances and bands out there.

135
00:13:08,95 --> 00:13:11,7
And sometimes those kind of situations would get ugly.

136
00:13:11,88 --> 00:13:18,36
And i would suddenly feel completely alienated from the whole thing. And that could be very frightening sometimes.

137
00:13:18,36 --> 00:13:25,00
And i suppose. Like living there has also been conducive to me. Kind of. You know.

138
00:13:25,00 --> 00:13:30,03
Trying different drugs and stuff like that which. You know. I probably.

139
00:13:30,42 --> 00:13:33,85
It's not that i regret doing it assists that i realize now that there's actually.

140
00:13:33,85 --> 00:13:39,88
You know no need to go as far into that as a lot of people do. And so i suppose you know. I didn't.

141
00:13:39,88 --> 00:13:43,45
I didn't need that kind of thing. But then there are a lot of other people who have those kind of.

142
00:13:43,45 --> 00:13:46,58
You know who have other reference points. You know.

143
00:13:46,58 --> 00:13:50,59
Forced upon them as well like you know all those people who get into driving fast cars around.

144
00:13:50,59 --> 00:13:53,81
People who get into just hanging out at the beijing doing nothing else you know.

145
00:13:53,81 --> 00:13:56,41
That's just the thing that young people do together. And it doesn't.

146
00:13:56,41 --> 00:13:59,67
In the end it doesn't matter whether it's one or the other. You know so.

147
00:13:59,67 --> 00:14:15,47
No i don't think there are any downsides at all. Whatever the phrase. You know. You are suppose.

148
00:14:15,47 --> 00:14:24,8
That makes your original. You know a bit more clear. For me. There were less downsides in growing up in that community.

149
00:14:24,8 --> 00:14:27,92
Because we also maintained a lot of ties with people outside.

150
00:14:27,92 --> 00:14:31,45
And i was aware of the value of a lot of things that were going on in mainstream society

151
00:14:31,45 --> 00:14:38,1
and i was aware that i was going to participate. And although i was growing up in this nice kind of.

152
00:14:38,1 --> 00:14:42,66
Supportive community. That i had a role to play in mainstream society as well and that.

153
00:14:42,66 --> 00:14:47,51
You know i needed to be able to communicate. And i needed to be able to be sort of. Well presented.

154
00:14:47,51 --> 00:14:52,28
And confident and straightforward. And all that type of thing. And so you know.

155
00:14:52,38 --> 00:14:58,23
I managed to learn a bit about open mindedness and. Letting go and stuff like that by living there. But then.

156
00:14:58,23 --> 00:15:03,19
Also keep it together enough to go back and do something that i consider to be worthwhile.

157
00:15:03,19 --> 00:15:09,56
You know participating with everyone. Whereas a lot of people who. You know grew up as hippies out there.

158
00:15:09,56 --> 00:15:16,25
Became very resentful about a lot of things in mainstream society. That made them very kind of afraid to participate.

159
00:15:16,25 --> 00:15:22,13
And so they became really kind of afraid of the way the government works and afraid of the way that the system works.

160
00:15:22,13 --> 00:15:26,14
And afraid of a lot of things that people do you know. On a large scale.

161
00:15:26,14 --> 00:15:29,03
Because you know they weren't used to all those mechanisms.

162
00:15:29,03 --> 00:15:31,82
And i weren't open minded to it and i've been taught that all of that was really bad.

163
00:15:31,82 --> 00:15:37,39
And that's why their parents ran away from it. And so a lot of those people have really. You know.

164
00:15:37,39 --> 00:15:44,35
Formed by the wayside and. Found very little to turn to other than sort of. You know. Drugs and kind of.

165
00:15:44,35 --> 00:15:50,37
You know very kind of. How would you say. Close knit afraid little groups that they hide in.

166
00:15:50,37 --> 00:16:09,66
And you see a lot of those people in the streets. Yes. You know. You do. Yes yes. Well. It's a very important industry.

167
00:16:09,9 --> 00:16:17,46
They're sort of. You know a lot of people pushing hero and stuff like that through this area. Who can't. You know.

168
00:16:17,46 --> 00:16:18,2
Realize that it's a lot.

169
00:16:18,2 --> 00:16:22,04
It can be a lot more lucrative than working just in sydney and stuff like that

170
00:16:22,04 --> 00:16:28,58
and they come up here with the intention of making a lot of money and. Often supporting a habit as well and. You know.

171
00:16:28,58 --> 00:16:34,75
It ties in perfectly with the with the marijuana industry that exists here. And you know. All the people who do it.

172
00:16:34,75 --> 00:16:42,23
You know. Basically really bad greedy people. And into people off. And you see it going on all the time down there.

173
00:16:42,23 --> 00:16:46,56
And you know. It's fine. It doesn't bother me at all because you know.

174
00:16:46,56 --> 00:16:52,2
The only people injuring people that are gullible enough to go and pay a lot of money for marijuana instead of crying.

175
00:16:52,2 --> 00:16:58,83
Themselves and. You know. So it's one. It's just another one of those industries just like fast food or. You know.

176
00:16:58,83 --> 00:17:10,75
Cheap cars or whatever. So you know. It doesn't. Yeah. As far as i'm concerned. You know the drug situation.

177
00:17:10,75 --> 00:17:16,69
In the streets of nimbin doesn't actually need defending. Because the people who are peddling the drugs.

178
00:17:16,69 --> 00:17:22,85
You know just sort of. Doing their own evil thing. And you know anyone who chooses to participate. You know.

179
00:17:22,85 --> 00:17:24,36
Enters at their own risk.

180
00:17:24,36 --> 00:17:29,6
And the people who are kind of falling for and buying dope to support that whole sort of system.

181
00:17:29,6 --> 00:17:35,67
You know just kind of following their own indulgent pursuits and that's fine if they want to pay money for it then.

182
00:17:35,67 --> 00:17:37,46
You know that's their problem and.

183
00:17:37,46 --> 00:17:41,45
I suppose the unfortunate thing about it is kind of gullible people who come to him

184
00:17:41,45 --> 00:17:47,06
and i don't know what they're looking for. And i find grass. And i get smashed and sit in the main street. You know.

185
00:17:47,06 --> 00:17:52,17
Looking dazed and confused and. You just have to realise that those people who form by the wayside.

186
00:17:52,17 --> 00:17:55,28
And i say choice to be stationary and. Indolent and.

187
00:17:55,28 --> 00:18:02,16
You know to not participate in in their society or not to take advantage of what they can do. And you know.

188
00:18:02,16 --> 00:18:04,79
People choose to do that in lots of ways. And you know.

189
00:18:04,79 --> 00:18:09,77
Sitting around in nimbin getting smashed is just as repetitive as. Working in a steel factory or.

190
00:18:09,77 --> 00:18:14,56
You know doing anything else which is kind of. Mind numbingly boring.

191
00:18:16,9 --> 00:18:33,69
Well you talk to you your friends of your peers who is now. In the news. So you know this story. Sure yeah. You know.

192
00:18:33,69 --> 00:18:38,84
Among people who've grown up the way that i have. They're living on communes and stuff like that.

193
00:18:38,84 --> 00:18:42,23
But still actually getting an education and still realizing that you know.

194
00:18:42,23 --> 00:18:50,1
There's a whole world of things to do out there. A lot of them. Like me. You know. Have sort of. Been down in sydney.

195
00:18:50,1 --> 00:18:54,88
And i'm going back there and stuff like that. But then there's another group of people.

196
00:18:55,9 --> 00:18:59,6
Who have sort of stayed out there and actually made a success.

197
00:18:59,6 --> 00:19:03,53
Out of living in the way that their parents who established and.

198
00:19:04,03 --> 00:19:08,7
I think that's a really really positive thing because you know you can actually create a really good life for yourself

199
00:19:08,7 --> 00:19:14,27
out there if you choose to do that and if you feel comfortable staying in that area. And so for example.

200
00:19:14,27 --> 00:19:23,11
And it's funny it's mainly people who know me to stand again now i can. And so.

201
00:19:23,11 --> 00:19:27,93
Among that group of people who've grown up the way i have. And i've chosen to stay out there and to and to.

202
00:19:27,93 --> 00:19:33,04
You know keep living in that area. A lot of them of kind of become involved in.

203
00:19:33,04 --> 00:19:39,17
Alternative employment and self employment and. A few people come to mind like a musician i know who.

204
00:19:39,17 --> 00:19:43,02
You know it could be just as successful playing in bands in sydney or up here.

205
00:19:43,02 --> 00:19:49,91
And chooses to keep living on the coming. That his dad. You know was part of setting up and. Is now kind of you know.

206
00:19:49,91 --> 00:19:54,05
Recording music out there and playing gigs in town and doing all. All that kind of thing.

207
00:19:54,05 --> 00:19:57,03
And that really works for him. And i think that's fantastic.

208
00:19:57,03 --> 00:20:02,47
And also i know a girl my age who sort of designs clothes and makes her own clothes

209
00:20:02,47 --> 00:20:07,51
and sells in the markets around here and stuff like that and. She's just had a child.

210
00:20:07,51 --> 00:20:10,92
Up at the commune that ice live on paradise valley.

211
00:20:10,92 --> 00:20:16,41
And you know has a really nice kind of existence up there with her boyfriend. In an old house and i saw the.

212
00:20:16,61 --> 00:20:20,21
People that lived in that house before. And now she's living there with a bunch of people.

213
00:20:20,21 --> 00:20:23,29
You know who i knew when we were all young together.

214
00:20:23,29 --> 00:20:26,38
And you know i think it's fantastic that they've chosen to stay around

215
00:20:26,38 --> 00:20:32,34
and make the best of what their parents who established there. And. I suppose. You know.

216
00:20:32,34 --> 00:20:39,39
It would be very hard to actually to actually say. The difference between those pay for. And the people who have.

217
00:20:39,39 --> 00:20:47,82
You know kind of. How do you say. Where that whole thing is collapsed. It's a bit hard to explain.

218
00:20:47,82 --> 00:21:00,74
This is this is this you know rose in this you know i wouldn't say that people my age.

219
00:21:00,74 --> 00:21:05,99
Choosing to stay in this area and. Make a go of it would be the actual next chapter. Because a lot more.

220
00:21:05,99 --> 00:21:12,72
Of the people who who stay around. End up finding themselves quite trapped. And quite clean of. You know.

221
00:21:12,72 --> 00:21:18,1
Productive in that situation and. I suppose. There are only a few of them who've really kind of. You know.

222
00:21:18,1 --> 00:21:22,96
Settled in and wanted to stay there. I'd say the next kind of.

223
00:21:22,96 --> 00:21:27,84
Stage in the progress of the whole thing will be a new type of people coming to that area.

224
00:21:27,84 --> 00:21:33,5
And there will be alternative settlers in the true sense of the word just like my parents' generation were.

225
00:21:33,5 --> 00:21:37,48
But they'll be choosing that. Those alternatives for different kind of reasons.

226
00:21:37,48 --> 00:21:42,97
Nobody realizing that they can still participate in mainstream society.

227
00:21:42,97 --> 00:21:46,7
And still have jobs and still do all that type of thing.

228
00:21:46,7 --> 00:21:50,51
But they don't actually have to live in the middle of the city in order to do it.

229
00:21:50,51 --> 00:21:55,15
And that they can also integrate that into having a more kind of down to earth lifestyle and.

230
00:21:55,15 --> 00:21:57,85
You know you see that kind of thing happening in this area quite a lot.

231
00:21:57,85 --> 00:22:04,44
Where there are people who've been educated and gone to university and become sort of a the doctors or. You know.

232
00:22:04,44 --> 00:22:09,72
Any kind of professions like that and then chosen to go and practice. Or do their thing. You know.

233
00:22:09,72 --> 00:22:11,92
In an area where they can also live on the land.

234
00:22:11,92 --> 00:22:17,61
And have a really useful comfortable life like that and i suppose you know. You could be kind of. Critical of that.

235
00:22:17,61 --> 00:22:21,94
Because you know a lot of people say. All those people belong in the city and that's where they should stay.

236
00:22:21,94 --> 00:22:27,01
But i don't necessarily agree with that i think if you are a writer or you know a doctor or. You know.

237
00:22:27,01 --> 00:22:32,57
A schoolteacher or any of those kind of professions and you want to live on the land is a perfect place to go

238
00:22:32,57 --> 00:22:39,54
and do it. You know. And you can. You know. Have a small block of land. Like the. You know. Perma culture.

239
00:22:39,54 --> 00:22:45,09
Plots that are coming out now and stuff like that. You could have a small part of land. And just get on with it and.

240
00:22:45,09 --> 00:22:50,81
You know and live your life the way you want to in terms of that and because there's so much. You know communication.

241
00:22:50,81 --> 00:22:55,76
Sort of technology becoming available free to stay integrated with the rest of society. You know.

242
00:22:55,76 --> 00:23:10,93
I think we'll see a lot more of them. So what you have for the area for me. Well i heard. The process. That.

243
00:23:10,93 --> 00:23:15,88
That is happening now. Continues to happen. Which is like.

244
00:23:15,88 --> 00:23:22,31
People realizing what are the good parts and what are the bad parts. Out of the alternative. That they've created.

245
00:23:22,31 --> 00:23:27,00
And actually you know starting to to look at it all in the positive sense of creating

246
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:33,17
and maintaining something that's really going to work. Not just something that will help them to survive.

247
00:23:33,17 --> 00:23:38,17
Running away from everything else. You know. Because a lot of people really do you just run for shelter.

248
00:23:38,17 --> 00:23:44,35
From a society that was running off the rails you know. And now. They've done their. It's.

249
00:23:44,35 --> 00:23:48,81
It's time to start maintaining the good part of it and you know just like in a garden. Making.

250
00:23:48,81 --> 00:23:58,96
The good parts of it grow and getting rid of the stuff that you don't need. And what you do you think of it.

251
00:23:58,96 --> 00:24:05,67
Well we lived. You know. In the main part of town for about ten years. And so i've had plenty of that now.

252
00:24:05,67 --> 00:24:07,52
But you know. If i.

253
00:24:07,52 --> 00:24:12,04
You know if i wanted to settle down and kind of live in a family situation

254
00:24:12,04 --> 00:24:16,41
or in a community situation i would definitely choose this area. And whether it was kind of.

255
00:24:16,48 --> 00:24:23,04
In the actual nimbin valley or in the surrounding commune. You know. Just in the general area like you know.

256
00:24:23,04 --> 00:24:29,15
Bangalow way over ever. You know. I know that i'll always be. Have ties with this area. Because you know.

257
00:24:29,15 --> 00:24:35,28
The land feels good to me here. But i definitely want to go and. You know.

258
00:24:35,28 --> 00:24:40,27
Shake it up a little bit in the city first and travel around the world and all those kind of things you know.

259
00:24:40,27 --> 00:24:45,42
And make the kind of people that would have never even conceived of anything like nimbin because there's a whole world.

260
00:24:45,42 --> 00:24:49,13
Of fascinating people out there who are doing totally different things to that. You know.

261
00:24:49,13 --> 00:24:54,63
And it's not as though there's just sort of sydney and melbourne. And then the alternative to that is you know.

262
00:24:54,63 --> 00:25:02,7
Living up on a community this sort of. Whole other strat as a society that. You know that i want to get into as well.

263
00:25:02,7 --> 00:25:18,95
So that's very good. I think because i can tell a story that makes.

264
00:25:18,95 --> 00:25:27,07
All of the positive things that is here about as communities look bad. And i came. All right. Most of the people.

265
00:25:27,07 --> 00:25:31,64
When i was really young about four or five years old all the people living out untouchable were sort of.

266
00:25:31,64 --> 00:25:37,28
You know pretty formed kind of hippies and. You know we're all pretty much in the same situation of.

267
00:25:37,28 --> 00:25:41,83
You know building our own houses and growing a little grass and selling and stuff like that and i one year.

268
00:25:41,83 --> 00:25:46,85
I'm sure you'll hear a few stories about this was a big bust out of town a bow. And a lot of people.

269
00:25:46,85 --> 00:25:52,76
Up for and it was a protest about the way the old town. That these people ended up doing some time anyway. And.

270
00:25:52,76 --> 00:25:55,94
I remember we were living in the garden house. And.

271
00:25:55,94 --> 00:26:00,1
That's right down in the bottom of the valley where the road comes up and ends and.

272
00:26:00,1 --> 00:26:04,47
That's where everyone sort of goes into a tunnel from there. So you know one noise.

273
00:26:04,47 --> 00:26:07,44
We heard this kind of sound from while. On the hill.

274
00:26:07,44 --> 00:26:12,35
And it was a truckload of all of these people who'd been in prison for a couple of weeks or whatever.

275
00:26:12,35 --> 00:26:16,41
Now coming back into the coal mine. And. They were really really drunk.

276
00:26:16,8 --> 00:26:20,79
And they went to kind of people that drank a lot because as i said they were used to just growing

277
00:26:20,79 --> 00:26:28,28
and smoking grass instead. And now old is absolutely. Out of their heads. And i came tearing back through the valley.

278
00:26:28,28 --> 00:26:33,19
And parked the truck. And came stumbling through the whole area screaming and banging on doors.

279
00:26:33,19 --> 00:26:37,95
Making a hole of noise and. The whole place was just you know. Terrified of what they were doing and.

280
00:26:37,95 --> 00:26:41,57
I don't know how it ended up. Because the last thing i mean i was hiding under my pillow.

281
00:26:41,57 --> 00:26:47,23
At the noise of these drunken he's stumbling through their commune in you know in victory that i've been let out.

282
00:26:47,23 --> 00:26:52,1
And i got up the next morning. And wondered out into the yard. And the whole yard was kind of.

283
00:26:52,1 --> 00:26:58,5
Littered with these white patches that they had left it was sort of stumbling through the hole in a live rail lawn and.

284
00:26:58,5 --> 00:27:02,44
I mean i was the supposed because i was used to them being such kind of peaceful people

285
00:27:02,44 --> 00:27:08,24
but to say them on the rampage like that is kind of for all you know. All these hippies must have a bit of.

286
00:27:08,24 --> 00:27:21,21
You know a stright in them. As a horse try to having a bit of hip. In them as well as us who was there.

287
00:27:21,21 --> 00:27:29,46
She was on and they didn't have wild and subtle actually. You know. And i didn't. All the hippie kids.

288
00:27:29,46 --> 00:27:34,35
And you had you know just names like white house.

289
00:27:35,38 --> 00:27:42,21
And i suppose there were some pretty wild adventures at school but it's not really the kind of things i can describe.

290
00:27:45,6 --> 00:27:53,77
I think. In primary school. All of the hippie kids kind of picked up on. The strike retain quite fast because you know.

291
00:27:53,77 --> 00:27:56,29
We had the school social scene and we had kind of.

292
00:27:56,29 --> 00:28:01,37
You know the youth group and stuff like that and hippie kids and straight kids all treated that exactly the same way

293
00:28:01,37 --> 00:28:05,69
and we you know. We all knew how much fun it was to get dressed up and get into music.

294
00:28:05,69 --> 00:28:11,44
And you know do all that type of thing and so there was you know. It was no big deal there toll.

295
00:28:11,44 --> 00:28:21,15
And if you give me a minute i'll be ever think of a funny story for. I also remember. A lot of kind of.

296
00:28:21,15 --> 00:28:25,47
Parties and things like that to my parents took me to when i was young and.

297
00:28:25,47 --> 00:28:31,42
Especially around the time of the ninety three festival which was the. Ten years after a festival. Remember seeing.

298
00:28:31,42 --> 00:28:37,32
Kind of that type of. Parties that they used to set up in the holes that they like there was the blue north pole.

299
00:28:37,32 --> 00:28:43,37
Which was famous for big sort of end of year parties and things like that and. They had a lot of mosque parties.

300
00:28:43,37 --> 00:28:48,46
And a lot of that type of thing. And at each one of these parties there were certain things that were guaranteed.

301
00:28:48,46 --> 00:28:53,62
Now you always have a whole lot of people with really long trade locks kind of standing around playing percussion.

302
00:28:53,62 --> 00:28:59,02
You know. In the main hole. And a lot of people jumping around that and a lot of kids running around. And then.

303
00:28:59,02 --> 00:29:04,36
Behind that there was always some kind of kitchen where someone would have set up a whole lot of really bizarre food

304
00:29:04,36 --> 00:29:12,15
and food supreme but. Then you and there'd be really stoned people. Ating just. Aging this stuff.

305
00:29:12,15 --> 00:29:14,02
And behind that if you eat.

306
00:29:14,02 --> 00:29:18,08
When you've got the back door of these holes which i mean just like a big patch of grass out there.

307
00:29:18,08 --> 00:29:23,68
And it always be a bonfire. And these people with really kind of natty dreadlocks sitting really in close to the fire.

308
00:29:23,68 --> 00:29:29,03
And just sort of staring into the fire and tripping off their heads and it would just go on and on and on

309
00:29:29,03 --> 00:29:32,92
and people just kind of circulate and you guy and sit by the fire frying get warm and then you going

310
00:29:32,92 --> 00:29:38,71
and ate some of this food. And you go and listen to the music for a while and you just keep going. You know. Oh mine.

311
00:29:38,71 --> 00:29:45,3
And i used to make these amazing kind of brews. Of. With magic mushrooms like a child tape with magic mushrooms in it.

312
00:29:45,3 --> 00:29:50,06
And some people would just be you know. Drinking the stuff. By the later and.

313
00:29:51,28 --> 00:29:53,05
Also some pretty incredible things i suppose

314
00:29:53,05 --> 00:29:57,55
and i don't really saying that bizarre to me because i've seen those people doing that for years.

315
00:29:57,55 --> 00:30:01,7
And it seems like a natural way to celebrate to me but if you went there for the first time.

316
00:30:01,7 --> 00:30:08,44
You really be amazed at the kind of stuff ace to do remember the ninety three festival. Seeing a similar kind of thing.

317
00:30:08,44 --> 00:30:16,41
I mean they were all of the normal type of. Pursuits like. You know. Is this rain going to ruin you. For me.

318
00:30:17,1 --> 00:30:21,33
They're all the. Sort of normal festival things to do you know.

319
00:30:21,33 --> 00:30:27,00
And the music and the sweat lodge and on top of things and running around in the fields. And then.

320
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:32,57
I remember seeing a great trip a festival. Who are all sitting around in this massive kind of circle.

321
00:30:32,57 --> 00:30:36,81
Holding hands and. Staring up at the sky and sort of chanting these really.

322
00:30:36,81 --> 00:30:41,82
Is really we had chance remember watching it. And actually trying to sort out what they're doing.

323
00:30:41,82 --> 00:30:46,12
And i wish they just gave up and walked away because i can. I can understand.

324
00:30:46,12 --> 00:30:50,47
You know what they're actually going for its whole. Well.

325
00:30:50,47 --> 00:30:54,92
I suppose the funniest things that i used to say where the kind of things that people would get up to

326
00:30:54,92 --> 00:30:59,92
when they were stoned. In the actual straits. As a child. I didn't have any problem with kind of.

327
00:30:59,92 --> 00:31:03,99
Watching quite closely the type of things though doing. Money actually being offended by and.

328
00:31:03,99 --> 00:31:10,00
Just sort of checking them out and i remember. You know they're the kind of really derelict hippies who you know.

329
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:14,88
Don't change their clothes for wakes and stuff like that and i would get really really drunk or.

330
00:31:14,88 --> 00:31:19,2
All smashed in the street in this kind of seat there. Either a the begging or.

331
00:31:19,48 --> 00:31:24,00
Or trying to irritate people as they walk past and i say. I swear to watch of ours and just sort of.

332
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:28,71
You know try and work it out without coming from. I remember this one guy who's a famous character.
