1
00:00:12,85 --> 00:00:26,69
You know. So. Nine hundred seventy four. I was living in new england platter. And lots of people traveling from.

2
00:00:27,33 --> 00:00:31,13
From name been. To sydney would go. By the back road.

3
00:00:31,13 --> 00:00:36,03
And stay at their place overnight so i used to get lots of news about what was happening in yemen.

4
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:39,98
In the setting up a tunnel. And it was part of me.

5
00:00:40,3 --> 00:00:46,00
They wanted to go back and fulfill the promise that we made at the public meeting we said. Had said that.

6
00:00:47,62 --> 00:00:55,11
The name and the. Christmas would bring young people back to the town and. Repopulate the area. And revitalize it.

7
00:00:55,11 --> 00:01:03,16
And it's turned into a slogan by the way the architecture student that we would recycle nimbin we would recycle a town

8
00:01:03,16 --> 00:01:12,82
and. I could see it was happening and slowly. I wanted to go along and. Bob it up so.

9
00:01:12,82 --> 00:01:22,45
We got an invitation from a group called the educational smorgasbord. Which was kind of based the bell and it was a.

10
00:01:22,45 --> 00:01:27,66
Gordon lang that was a retired primary school teacher got some money from the school's commission at that stage to

11
00:01:27,66 --> 00:01:32,59
develop. Community learning. And we had some expertise at that from that.

12
00:01:32,59 --> 00:01:37,47
The festival learning exchange that happened at the pfister we had a model for doing that.

13
00:01:37,47 --> 00:01:46,62
So rather than take a job as an individual life. I think formed a partnership with a couple of people including chance.

14
00:01:46,62 --> 00:01:52,86
Who's one of the site manager of the festival the guy most responsible for the physical. Works on the festival.

15
00:01:53,32 --> 00:01:59,98
We formed a company called the reality construction company. And how job was the gun.

16
00:02:00,46 --> 00:02:10,19
You know turned myths into reality. We were going to create this new community. New future is. You newman and.

17
00:02:10,19 --> 00:02:14,11
We were all about flesh and flea and. Doing it with style. And sort of.

18
00:02:15,46 --> 00:02:24,43
Feeling that the name when it would become a big gumboot. You know sort of lost in the mud.

19
00:02:24,43 --> 00:02:31,24
Because all of the limits that the people who founded tumble. And did some one of them are syringes conditions that.

20
00:02:31,24 --> 00:02:39,48
Fifty people living in a single house you know. In the heaviest rains. Who are you know sort of twenty is.

21
00:02:39,48 --> 00:02:41,13
It was disparate. Times and.

22
00:02:41,13 --> 00:02:48,01
No money no money to do any development work to buy the tools materials think you know a lot. And lots of madness.

23
00:02:48,01 --> 00:02:54,39
And lots of people coming in plugging in and wanting help and what kind of stuff. Also cites. You know.

24
00:02:54,39 --> 00:03:02,6
This strange mixture of piny as and parasites and. Sites and. Paranoids you know like weeds the the the.

25
00:03:02,6 --> 00:03:11,54
The vision of collected. So we came back to name and first we sort of. Caressed into name been lifted you people.

26
00:03:12,65 --> 00:03:15,98
And that the company was working. Kind of blew apart.

27
00:03:15,98 --> 00:03:20,86
The reality construction company never actually got to him and blew apart in linux he had.

28
00:03:20,86 --> 00:03:26,61
Gordon lange wouldn't made a set up in him because he didn't want them. To be polluted by the aquarius dream.

29
00:03:26,61 --> 00:03:30,34
He went into question small was would this be seen as kind of straight.

30
00:03:31,05 --> 00:03:37,68
It was kind of ironic the only people interested in these new ideas were the hippies of course that. So it was.

31
00:03:37,68 --> 00:03:46,98
We did a couple of good things including two or yellow brick road show us. Nigel trivets theatre in education piece.

32
00:03:46,98 --> 00:03:55,51
Anyway we blew apart and i ended up living in human again. And working with my partner. On community development.

33
00:03:55,51 --> 00:04:00,75
And what what became obvious to us immediately was that.

34
00:04:00,75 --> 00:04:05,12
What we'd taken for granted well organized and you crystal clear this festival had been forgotten.

35
00:04:06,47 --> 00:04:10,96
People who example didn't know that you could hire the whole to have a public meeting. You know.

36
00:04:10,96 --> 00:04:15,49
There's so much antagonism a great. Between the people who stayed after the festival and the townspeople.

37
00:04:15,49 --> 00:04:23,11
But the fists the community services were seen things being withheld and not available to people.

38
00:04:23,11 --> 00:04:31,01
So are we realized that. Building this community was going to be grassroots work and.

39
00:04:31,01 --> 00:04:37,13
In the beginning of it was like learning how to have meetings again. Learning him. How to have community meetings.

40
00:04:37,95 --> 00:04:44,91
One of the legacies of the queerest festival was that the festival had acquired property in the main street of member.

41
00:04:46,18 --> 00:04:51,71
I mention the are still whole have been purchased by the festival net was sold after the festival to a group of people

42
00:04:51,71 --> 00:04:57,83
who said that they were going to stay behind and. You know some of them were already owning property and.

43
00:04:57,83 --> 00:05:03,79
That the building would be there for community function. And we sure would that there was a sufficient spirit of.

44
00:05:03,79 --> 00:05:08,56
I don't know this that. Can never be sold. Right no one could be everyone had to agree to sell it.

45
00:05:08,56 --> 00:05:15,85
And there's no way these people would ever agree. The rainbow cafe the lease and the rainbow cafe.

46
00:05:15,85 --> 00:05:21,55
Was extended and they cannot by the tunnel force cooperative. And my partner.

47
00:05:21,55 --> 00:05:26,88
Purchased the tomato sauce factory which was an old general store. In the one street.

48
00:05:26,88 --> 00:05:36,68
And these people were all available for. Community business. Specifically for the new settlers. This.

49
00:05:36,68 --> 00:05:41,68
Contrast to what was happening over at my naaman mullumbimby where the people had settled in the hills in the valley.

50
00:05:41,68 --> 00:05:46,05
And around there and had no presence. To speak of in the town.

51
00:05:46,05 --> 00:05:52,37
Niman always always had a shop front present for the new settlers. Now. This was an advantage.

52
00:05:53,12 --> 00:05:59,28
The poor the early community development organization because we had a central place to organize services from the.

53
00:06:00,87 --> 00:06:08,64
The the media factory was what we called the are still. Whole. Became a healing center. Right and swear. Carol.

54
00:06:08,64 --> 00:06:14,78
Elliott no one stand up and the first acupuncture practice on the north coast. Just.

55
00:06:14,78 --> 00:06:20,69
Message was offered the and who will treat treatments. And also became the center for organizing.

56
00:06:20,69 --> 00:06:26,07
The birth and beyond group the. Sort of the home birthing unit. That came later.

57
00:06:27,08 --> 00:06:29,86
Well we said in the back of the media factory and had.

58
00:06:29,86 --> 00:06:35,56
The first meetings of what was to become the home builders association because it became aware that the.

59
00:06:35,56 --> 00:06:40,21
Designing the land zoning. Was not what people wanted.

60
00:06:40,21 --> 00:06:47,39
People want to divide the land and allow other people to build houses on it. So there was lots of land available.

61
00:06:47,39 --> 00:06:53,4
Very cheaply. But the zoning required you can only build one house behinder dicked is.

62
00:06:53,4 --> 00:07:00,56
Now people are already building their houses by seventy full on these properties and are legal.

63
00:07:00,56 --> 00:07:08,01
So the home builders association was formed to negotiate with the council about changing the zoning. And.

64
00:07:08,01 --> 00:07:15,26
The first meeting so this home builders association were. About learning how to have meetings. And this was critical.

65
00:07:15,26 --> 00:07:22,83
Because what had happened was that. Everyone had a piece of the dream. That had been seeded by the curious fistful.

66
00:07:22,83 --> 00:07:28,66
But no foreign forth. So when the former's created. Everyone came in mauritius vomited. Their frustration.

67
00:07:28,66 --> 00:07:34,08
In the dream onto the meeting. There was lots of talk but no listening.

68
00:07:34,08 --> 00:07:37,4
So we had to work very hard at the stablish ing.

69
00:07:37,4 --> 00:07:43,97
Ways of having meetings in basically the format of sitting in a circle. Having introductions everyone spoke.

70
00:07:43,97 --> 00:07:48,53
Went around the circle everyone spoke. Introduce themselves and said what are the meaningful.

71
00:07:48,53 --> 00:07:55,5
And then we would set the agenda. From what had come up. And then we would talk right. And just require.

72
00:07:56,98 --> 00:07:59,44
Some moderation as a whole argument that structure.

73
00:07:59,44 --> 00:08:03,44
Was a part of would have a channel with stuff would quickly you know with.

74
00:08:03,44 --> 00:08:09,19
Cheering it round but basically there was someone who said. You're speaking too much you're considered think you're.

75
00:08:09,19 --> 00:08:12,29
Someone took responsibility for the meeting.

76
00:08:12,8 --> 00:08:20,54
Now having established the rules and having established the process of listening to people. We moved very quickly.

77
00:08:21,29 --> 00:08:28,01
And the home builders association was an enormously successful negotiating body. We got membership.

78
00:08:28,01 --> 00:08:32,65
All over the place i mean. That was one of the stories about the home builders association.

79
00:08:32,65 --> 00:08:38,37
Like all good voluntary associations we needed some money to spend so we decided we'd have to have a benefit concert.

80
00:08:39,13 --> 00:08:42,17
We had the benefit concert we realized there were no musicians.

81
00:08:42,17 --> 00:08:47,64
Right chris and introduced lots of musicians to get into the area. But they weren't playing together.

82
00:08:48,12 --> 00:08:54,54
So we only had a couple of people singing songs with guitars you know. But it's still a good thing but.

83
00:08:54,54 --> 00:09:02,28
Out of that result. We've got to do something about the music because this is also our priority. So i was.

84
00:09:02,28 --> 00:09:07,4
We were approached by a group who want to set up a folk love in the matter saw it

85
00:09:07,4 --> 00:09:10,87
and we said well this is this what we've been waiting for so we. You know.

86
00:09:10,87 --> 00:09:16,59
My partner and i thrust support behind the folk line. And the folk love. Took off like a rocket.

87
00:09:16,59 --> 00:09:20,27
All these people came out and started playing the music together.

88
00:09:20,27 --> 00:09:23,2
And listening to each other and forming new combinations and rehearsing

89
00:09:23,2 --> 00:09:29,11
and practicing bringing you songs to the to the. The folk club.

90
00:09:29,11 --> 00:09:33,69
Suddenly there was a flowering of music in the been and.

91
00:09:33,69 --> 00:09:34,01
Such that

92
00:09:34,01 --> 00:09:39,07
when we came to do the knicks been a fit for the home builders association which was only like three months down the

93
00:09:39,07 --> 00:09:39,61
track.

94
00:09:39,61 --> 00:09:44,28
We had thought of different combinations of musicians fighting for the states you know this is all voters you know

95
00:09:44,28 --> 00:09:49,98
people saying oh we want to fly rehearse this for you.

96
00:09:49,98 --> 00:09:54,69
So that was the kind of organization was going on at the time and the name in news we started up.

97
00:09:54,69 --> 00:10:05,89
The new news with sort of a running through skep staple publication and. We introduced. Rules which were no censorship.

98
00:10:06,34 --> 00:10:13,88
You could say what your life. But you had to put your name on it yet to own what you wrote. Arguing that. That.

99
00:10:13,88 --> 00:10:15,93
The village was so small that.

100
00:10:15,93 --> 00:10:21,22
You know people would get immediate feedback of this in an outrageous from the people they defended. We could afford.

101
00:10:21,22 --> 00:10:27,15
And since it had no capital we didn't we weren't. Obligated by need. Defamation laws or anything like that. You know.

102
00:10:27,15 --> 00:10:35,43
No one was at risk will the individuals be at risk but certainly not the publication of the assets of zero and.

103
00:10:35,43 --> 00:10:38,2
The name in news was the most fascinating publication.

104
00:10:38,33 --> 00:10:43,89
I've seen at the time i've been the editor of student publications we get the strangest. You know.

105
00:10:43,89 --> 00:10:50,25
Made right moves and. Sort of birth notices that people are calling the a still.

106
00:10:50,25 --> 00:10:57,28
Manga sunshine you have to remember sunshine and things like this with the most delightful news. Would appear in this.

107
00:10:57,28 --> 00:10:59,94
And always incredibly immediate and this used to come out weekly

108
00:10:59,94 --> 00:11:06,04
and it was enormously bonding thing so the home bill's association had in effect it had its own.

109
00:11:06,04 --> 00:11:08,31
News organ that got out to all the people building.

110
00:11:08,31 --> 00:11:14,69
About what was happening with the negotiations which started with the council on my own feeling was a soon as we had

111
00:11:14,69 --> 00:11:19,49
established and ago she a sion with the council. We were certainly going to win.

112
00:11:19,49 --> 00:11:25,77
Rights as soon as we'd sent the negotiation home builders put out to everyone stop building like crazy.

113
00:11:25,77 --> 00:11:32,49
Because everything that is built will be approved. When the new zoning comes in at least that will win that much.

114
00:11:33,19 --> 00:11:36,17
So this rapidly lead to confrontation.

115
00:11:36,17 --> 00:11:36,4
That

116
00:11:36,4 --> 00:11:43,61
when the council became a widow which was won by this time the lismore city council became aware of how extensive the

117
00:11:43,61 --> 00:11:48,65
illegal building was was that was happening in the hills they wanted to put the brakes on.

118
00:11:48,65 --> 00:11:56,04
And get pull at the borders as. Well at this time. Things begin to move very quickly.

119
00:11:57,46 --> 00:12:03,61
It was like felt like a golden period with this seemed to be like nothing that we could do that. Wasn't magical.

120
00:12:03,61 --> 00:12:12,29
We had both we had folk loans we had concerts. Slim dusty came to town. And working the main street of the infinite.

121
00:12:12,8 --> 00:12:19,63
You know you know slim dusty. Yeah yeah. Good to meet you. You know. We're playing it. You know.

122
00:12:19,63 --> 00:12:24,49
And they are sometimes we thought when drop drop. We we had a little just before the festival.

123
00:12:26,18 --> 00:12:31,59
We were invited to play at the festival it was a lovely letter from. Maybe you know. By tool.

124
00:12:31,59 --> 00:12:39,81
I bought two of my partner. From your noa sure do want to come to dinner and come and meet violet. Would like that.

125
00:12:40,44 --> 00:12:41,68
And that you know. Slim.

126
00:12:41,68 --> 00:12:45,53
So i'm just enjoying it came just lovely people who travel in country towns will realise this love this.

127
00:12:46,37 --> 00:12:49,12
So they came out with a band and had dinner with us

128
00:12:49,12 --> 00:12:52,16
and we say well why don't you know you've got a night off tomorrow night.

129
00:12:52,16 --> 00:12:56,95
Why don't you come to a concert in the nimon home that played in the name of whole one time or other.

130
00:12:56,95 --> 00:12:59,05
And with the folk like this guest of the folk club.

131
00:12:59,17 --> 00:13:04,36
So he's in the twenty four hours to organise this this concert with featuring slim dusty in the in the.

132
00:13:04,36 --> 00:13:09,11
The best of the folk club. And it was the most amazing concert. Like the folk.

133
00:13:09,11 --> 00:13:12,04
Everyone from the folk club will perform was just shining that night

134
00:13:12,04 --> 00:13:20,23
and all the townspeople turned out to see this di slim dusty and. Slim dusty performed it was just. It meant.

135
00:13:20,23 --> 00:13:26,56
There's one of us. Those nights. And we had naming ceremonies and we had.

136
00:13:26,56 --> 00:13:28,86
Healing festivals that all this kind of stuff.

137
00:13:28,86 --> 00:13:32,47
And for me the principle of community organization which i was doing

138
00:13:32,47 --> 00:13:41,4
and sharing with lots of other people was creating events where people could experience the joy of community that.

139
00:13:41,4 --> 00:13:47,72
What they believed in was affirmed in the experience of joy together she had julie. So not at the folk club.

140
00:13:47,72 --> 00:13:51,23
I don't remember crying. The song. There was some.

141
00:13:51,64 --> 00:14:00,44
It was both the quality of the music in the voice but also in the sentiments that people were seeing to each other.

142
00:14:00,87 --> 00:14:12,29
We grew very quickly very tight as a community and. Established. Like i say. The norms for the.

143
00:14:12,54 --> 00:14:16,44
Unity the expectation is that the extraordinary things happened in women.

144
00:14:16,44 --> 00:14:20,8
And there were lots of the bites of it between vegetarians in these and all this kind of stuff.

145
00:14:20,8 --> 00:14:29,75
But as if the dreams that have been seeded by the queerest festival. Begin to take. Form in community.

146
00:14:29,75 --> 00:14:36,85
And there were sufficient. Concentration of people to carry these values. Into everyday life and make them realities.

147
00:14:36,85 --> 00:14:39,84
So that. For example. Everything back to the birth and beyond group.

148
00:14:39,89 --> 00:14:45,33
It was only a matter of time before people started having babies and families. Developing me.

149
00:14:45,33 --> 00:14:54,4
And the healings center was called upon to help with the birth things. And carol. Carol's more.

150
00:14:54,4 --> 00:14:58,47
Psychic thinner than a medical. Medically trained people.

151
00:14:58,47 --> 00:15:04,51
Person but entered into this in the healing training for record pension. In good faith.

152
00:15:04,51 --> 00:15:07,92
And good will and with lots of support from people.

153
00:15:07,92 --> 00:15:15,24
Build up this birth and be on movement and birth became a spiritual experience. Such that people.

154
00:15:15,24 --> 00:15:20,52
Preferred to have home births. Than go to the lismore base hospital in the labor ward. Now.

155
00:15:20,52 --> 00:15:25,8
They were outcries of course from the doctors and because the theatre and all this kind of stuff.

156
00:15:25,8 --> 00:15:33,84
But the end result was that the labor ward in lismore changed. That i made the birthing process is much more humane.

157
00:15:33,84 --> 00:15:41,04
Much more people scented. You know. By a.b.c. Entered. Than had previously been.

158
00:15:41,04 --> 00:15:46,37
And the principles of spiritual midwood three of which you've been introduced through the new settlers in women.

159
00:15:46,37 --> 00:15:49,92
Became integrated in hospital practice in lisbon.

160
00:15:49,92 --> 00:15:55,07
So it's like that they need to be a concentration of people who willing to have home birth wanted the service.

161
00:15:55,07 --> 00:16:01,84
And once that was established and influence lots of other people as well. And then. Attitudes towards trees.

162
00:16:02,98 --> 00:16:06,71
The area of the settled by white people first.

163
00:16:06,71 --> 00:16:14,25
The first was people came to syria to cut down trees in the city to get us into. The primeval forest.

164
00:16:14,25 --> 00:16:17,8
First took the cedar. And then it was divided. The selection.

165
00:16:18,49 --> 00:16:24,87
The blocks the land was sold down south and when the conditions was that people come up here and. Clear their land.

166
00:16:25,26 --> 00:16:37,31
To create. Us. So very quickly. An extensive rainforest. Would from a cost to forty kilometers inland. The normal size.

167
00:16:37,31 --> 00:16:46,89
Including the tweed valley. Right down to the richmond. Was almost wiped out and set up the dairy farms.

168
00:16:48,84 --> 00:16:52,98
The new settlers coming to the area had a completely different attitude to trees they had been influenced by the goal

169
00:16:52,98 --> 00:16:54,29
of the movement.

170
00:16:54,29 --> 00:16:55,24
Things like that so even

171
00:16:55,24 --> 00:16:59,66
when we're preparing for the fish we were proposed by people from the borders ranges saying are you aware what's

172
00:16:59,66 --> 00:17:05,2
happening at the ranges. The border ranges to look one of the remnants of the big scrub.

173
00:17:05,2 --> 00:17:10,33
And by night one seventy four people are aware of the logging practices were happening on the night kept range this

174
00:17:10,33 --> 00:17:15,79
behind him and. Where the the. The loggers were just leaving a sort of a curtain of trees by the road.

175
00:17:15,79 --> 00:17:19,48
And almost clear filling the property

176
00:17:19,48 --> 00:17:26,06
but on the hillsides under supervision of the force of commission which was at the time calling it selective looking

177
00:17:26,06 --> 00:17:30,48
which was take anything of value and drop the lot.

178
00:17:31,41 --> 00:17:34,71
When we were first approached about this with a sense of frustration what can we do.

179
00:17:34,71 --> 00:17:41,43
Right we're organizing fist of all and. We don't have them. The way with a lot of organized protest the same time.

180
00:17:42,35 --> 00:17:45,48
But by. Nine hundred seventy six. Like.

181
00:17:45,48 --> 00:17:52,55
It was a community concern about what was happening with the logan and then it erupted.

182
00:17:52,55 --> 00:17:57,48
At the battle of trying to create in the situation was that the new settlers.

183
00:17:57,48 --> 00:18:03,11
Had moved into the area in the drainage creeks when the creeks it runs into the channel.

184
00:18:03,11 --> 00:18:08,92
And it's like two valleys across from going. East. Going west. Sorry.

185
00:18:08,92 --> 00:18:15,14
Going east from nimbin it's like two valleys across. And then he went one road up the creek and.

186
00:18:15,14 --> 00:18:24,22
At the end of the creek was fifty hc to force which was enclosed by rock. On the other side so that.

187
00:18:24,22 --> 00:18:30,82
Part of the reason that it had such old trees in it was that. Previous technologies. It was an inaccessible.

188
00:18:30,82 --> 00:18:35,54
And the brush box wasn't valued. For all that much but now the force the commission. Decided that that.

189
00:18:35,54 --> 00:18:38,64
Forest had to go to live in a lot of brush books.

190
00:18:38,64 --> 00:18:41,42
And the residents complained about the destruction the forest

191
00:18:41,42 --> 00:18:47,1
and i also pointed out that they didn't want these logging trucks. On the road there's only one right.

192
00:18:47,1 --> 00:18:52,69
And they were entered in negotiations with the forest commission and they came to the zilch. The first missions.

193
00:18:52,69 --> 00:19:00,58
Of the force of the following. You can sense that we don't care and replied lismore city council was to put up signs.

194
00:19:00,58 --> 00:19:04,36
I'm with the residents. Beware of logging trucks. Not. You know.

195
00:19:04,36 --> 00:19:07,72
So and i'm at the logging truck saying people are is going to take kids.

196
00:19:07,72 --> 00:19:14,01
But they came for you to chosen to live here and you'll suffer. If you don't take notice of that log loading trucks.

197
00:19:14,17 --> 00:19:22,31
So it was like a slap in the face no negotiations came to nothing. The people who are negotiating that. Decide.

198
00:19:22,31 --> 00:19:30,94
Protests was called for and they approached me and other people. For assistance in transforming. A committee meeting.

199
00:19:30,94 --> 00:19:37,13
Into a public protests and i joined the protests that that study aids

200
00:19:37,13 --> 00:19:42,82
and i didn't ever want to become involved in any more committees that have been committed up to my ears for long.

201
00:19:42,82 --> 00:19:50,97
You know. Moving. And i. I went along for the role i want to play with like sharman. I want to just work on the energy.

202
00:19:50,97 --> 00:19:56,53
That hell would hold a group of people together who certainly thought it would draw a crowd. And we created a bit of.

203
00:19:56,53 --> 00:20:05,51
Theater which was performed at the the china market using biggie midges and music. To tell the story. Of the proteus.

204
00:20:05,51 --> 00:20:12,29
And to announce the people there would be a meeting at the forest. The following wednesday and.

205
00:20:12,42 --> 00:20:19,38
The bit of theater was very graphic. Big media is dancing around and. Kind of mystical.

206
00:20:21,43 --> 00:20:28,54
Big crosas adult man with kind of stuff. So it's almost signs.

207
00:20:28,54 --> 00:20:37,55
Moving in and the following wednesday we had a meeting at the site and. The leaders of the. The festival.

208
00:20:39,06 --> 00:20:47,1
How do you turn this into a unified group of people are going to work together. And kids. The impulse.

209
00:20:47,1 --> 00:20:52,73
Of committee people just to stand out from the crowd and talk at them. You know. And i'm saying well.

210
00:20:52,73 --> 00:20:56,56
There's other ways to do it. And one of the things to do is to complete the circle.

211
00:20:56,56 --> 00:20:59,75
Get people to see the circus of written get a circle happening.

212
00:20:59,75 --> 00:21:07,49
We've got the grounds where real communication can happen. And with a bit of music in the systems from friends.

213
00:21:07,49 --> 00:21:09,58
We completed the circle.

214
00:21:09,58 --> 00:21:14,92
And it went from being a disparate people not knowing whether they should be there or whether they were present.

215
00:21:14,92 --> 00:21:21,45
To a group of people sitting down. Planning a protest. And trusting each other just everything the basic trust.

216
00:21:21,77 --> 00:21:33,15
So it was that circles. Tribal circles became sort of a fundamental ingredient to. The first protests. That happened.

217
00:21:33,15 --> 00:21:38,33
On the winds day. And the following monday it was a council meeting in. Reasonable.

218
00:21:38,33 --> 00:21:42,46
With a buddy famines but he thought it was one of the only communities.

219
00:21:42,46 --> 00:21:48,55
That had announced that it was going to build regardless. You know. It was doing the morally correct thing.

220
00:21:48,67 --> 00:21:52,11
It was providing. Low cost accommodation to house people.

221
00:21:52,11 --> 00:21:56,98
So they can raise the thing only and no lore in the land should prevent people from doing that.

222
00:21:56,98 --> 00:22:00,11
So they took a totally moral stand and.

223
00:22:00,11 --> 00:22:05,36
Let the council know what they were doing working with the hundreds of the social. And that would determine to be.

224
00:22:05,36 --> 00:22:12,29
The pivot. You know the test case. They'd incorporated themselves as a church. In a ready to fight.

225
00:22:12,47 --> 00:22:20,97
As an ethical community. Doing what was right in the times and. The council conceded their case that night.

226
00:22:20,97 --> 00:22:27,58
And these national party. Councils got up and said things like breaking a little.

227
00:22:27,58 --> 00:22:30,53
Advocate that we knocked down the house as soon as possible.

228
00:22:30,53 --> 00:22:35,54
And in the gallery of the body thumbs with the baby's line how do you know it was like a classic.

229
00:22:35,54 --> 00:22:40,55
You know this like a peasant class this is the new pool. You know.

230
00:22:40,55 --> 00:22:48,5
Totally i think i'm clearly clear about what they want to do. Against this with these. Rantings of these ageing.

231
00:22:48,5 --> 00:22:53,66
Community leaders who had no regard no compassion. Whatsoever for the people.

232
00:22:53,66 --> 00:23:00,83
So for me it was obvious that the battle for the forest. And the battle for the houses were one of the same.

233
00:23:00,83 --> 00:23:05,91
If we lost the trees we'd certainly lose the houses because they disposed us that houses in the same way they build us

234
00:23:05,91 --> 00:23:14,86
the trees. So the name in news put that missy jaffe. You know. To everyone. This was it. This was crunch time.

235
00:23:14,86 --> 00:23:21,87
On the wednesday. After that meeting. The bulldozers. Arrived at the forest they came down via a back road. The.

236
00:23:21,87 --> 00:23:30,2
The telephone tree worked and we. You know within an hour we had about one hundred people gathered at the forest.

237
00:23:30,2 --> 00:23:37,72
And the images. That would have been used in the play would vote to be. And took great pride in.

238
00:23:38,2 --> 00:23:44,3
Putting the dollar manny means on top of the bulldozer. And it became the icon the sydney morning herald used to.

239
00:23:44,3 --> 00:23:50,36
And that sort of died a report of this protest. And we stopped the vote as it was any measure of time. You know the.

240
00:23:50,36 --> 00:23:56,18
More police and more reinforcements were coming and it was a big showdown the minister for. Forests.

241
00:23:58,05 --> 00:24:02,05
Was totally against the hippies he was from. Griffith.

242
00:24:02,05 --> 00:24:07,58
Any writing his local newspaper that he was going to do is you know we printed that article. You know. Moralist saying.

243
00:24:07,58 --> 00:24:12,29
They're just rabble rousing hippies and we haven't taken notice of them. We printed that.

244
00:24:12,56 --> 00:24:20,29
Poured in the name when you simply want to know what we're up against and. Raise the ire of the people.

245
00:24:20,29 --> 00:24:26,62
And created this community. Now we brought all our cultural resources to bear on that proteus.

246
00:24:26,62 --> 00:24:36,5
The musicians from the folk on time and. Wrote anthems. First the seeing. The healers were there to help people.

247
00:24:36,5 --> 00:24:42,75
All the communication skills we developed and home builders association reply and coming to agreements.

248
00:24:42,75 --> 00:24:49,98
And the community was strong and i remember the day that the police reinforcements arrived and there. They had people.

249
00:24:49,98 --> 00:24:53,17
From as far as newcastle rusted on duty.

250
00:24:53,17 --> 00:24:59,2
To do the show when they came along and i was psyched up the police were aggressive i really got a roll of us you know.

251
00:24:59,2 --> 00:25:04,28
And we were still we had a circle. At the camp that morning and.

252
00:25:05,62 --> 00:25:12,15
We have been lots of discussions but basically we had been i would agree what we were going to do. Run.

253
00:25:12,15 --> 00:25:17,77
It was lots of tension lots of theater in the circle and. No clear direction.

254
00:25:18,23 --> 00:25:26,56
And we stood together holding in the circle holding close oms into the. Intertwined and took off.

255
00:25:26,81 --> 00:25:35,79
And this one was slow sublime. So strong. You could feel the spirit. Lifting us up before her. That seven.

256
00:25:35,79 --> 00:25:43,2
And i'm on my knees buckled. I just couldn't stand. T. Is streaming down high. My eyes. But that.

257
00:25:43,2 --> 00:25:50,05
One thing was obvious that we were in the spirit that. Strong in the spirit. We would be together.

258
00:25:50,05 --> 00:26:00,44
And we would defend the forest and we would win. It was clear. And. So we yielded before the. The police attack.

259
00:26:02,21 --> 00:26:07,83
They they just bonsor they pushed through our lines. They pushed away the obstacle was in the bulldozers.

260
00:26:07,83 --> 00:26:14,83
Plowed through the forest appearing road to take the logs out. But we studied that right.

261
00:26:14,83 --> 00:26:18,67
And then it became obvious that happiness of your answer is going to win the battle. Like.

262
00:26:18,67 --> 00:26:24,05
The longer we stay that was costing the police. Tapes. The thing the state government.

263
00:26:24,05 --> 00:26:28,22
They were playing the police overtime they put him in motels all is going to stuff.

264
00:26:28,22 --> 00:26:34,76
Whereas we were living in our home country this was the battle of the same thing through a ride with the invading force.

265
00:26:34,76 --> 00:26:42,08
We are in the hills and. Said people would bring in supplies or bring his food. We had a camp kitchen. Cooperate.

266
00:26:42,08 --> 00:26:46,19
Cooking. It was the thing with the query festival over again. Right.

267
00:26:46,19 --> 00:26:53,08
We were seen enjoying us hills and dancing and talking and. Sitting around campfires. We were very good at this.

268
00:26:53,08 --> 00:27:00,49
So for four weeks. We maintain this presence in the forest and pressure on the loading operations and.

269
00:27:00,49 --> 00:27:06,38
As time went by we became stronger and stronger. And as time went by the police became weaker and weaker.

270
00:27:06,38 --> 00:27:07,94
As a defense force.

271
00:27:07,94 --> 00:27:08,39
For the low

272
00:27:08,39 --> 00:27:13,79
but it's because every day they talk to these most battles of sitting around doing nothing so the police are sitting in

273
00:27:13,79 --> 00:27:17,91
the forest. Saying this is a really nice force. And he said you know.

274
00:27:17,91 --> 00:27:29,13
What a message and so in the end it was like the police wouldn't allow loading trucks to go out without god's wrath.

275
00:27:29,13 --> 00:27:31,97
Without a convoy of police cars and policeman.

276
00:27:31,97 --> 00:27:40,4
Which took a long time to organize so that the logging operation was incredibly slow down as well. And.

277
00:27:40,4 --> 00:27:46,15
So it was that them. A moratorium. Was called naval rent change his position.

278
00:27:46,15 --> 00:27:50,71
In talking about it why would he cause you through with. You know.

279
00:27:51,3 --> 00:27:57,8
He'd be repetitious we moved from concerned to describe me as a city rep a concern conservationists within two weeks

280
00:27:57,8 --> 00:28:09,17
rising. Suddenly realize there were votes in. Conservation and called a halt to the operation. And an inquiry which.

281
00:28:09,17 --> 00:28:13,07
We knew in the forest. We knew we'd won. And it took two years. The state government.

282
00:28:13,07 --> 00:28:19,26
To acknowledge that they went to logan forest they were gay and. It was going to become a state. So we won.

283
00:28:19,26 --> 00:28:24,63
And because of the heat. That was generated by the battle. When it came to the housing issue.

284
00:28:24,63 --> 00:28:29,9
The state government stepped in when we have to say look we won the forest and then they got to get us.

285
00:28:29,9 --> 00:28:36,83
And like that the houses. Pull landers at that time the minister the late poor man that was used to the planning.

286
00:28:36,83 --> 00:28:40,81
Stepped in and employed coal james the planner of the. Chris this table.

287
00:28:40,81 --> 00:28:46,1
To come up with a solution to the zoning problem which led to multiple occupancy. Dwellings up here.

288
00:28:48,92 --> 00:28:52,42
So it was as if we went from a very short time.

289
00:28:53,16 --> 00:29:00,29
Post the queries first of all when the community was weak and disparate with a vision and.

290
00:29:00,29 --> 00:29:03,00
Committed work from a number of people to create a sense of community

291
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:09,8
and she did that years into a community that was strong enough to take on the first. Commission.

292
00:29:09,8 --> 00:29:17,29
And completely reverse. Attitudes to looking in the area. The battle of tyranny creek with the thirst successful.

293
00:29:17,29 --> 00:29:23,19
Rainforest things in australia. The people who fought that fought went down to the franklin and.

294
00:29:23,19 --> 00:29:28,8
Taught people not nonviolent action. So there were a major influence in the way that the. The the franklin.

295
00:29:28,8 --> 00:29:35,23
Was fought the. The people also not kept range which is the one looking women.

296
00:29:35,23 --> 00:29:39,84
A couple of years later and then of a she lost. This you.

297
00:29:39,84 --> 00:29:45,62
Was defended and the knight kept range which was the last major pocket of rainforest of the big screen.

298
00:29:45,62 --> 00:29:48,77
Was turned into a national park.

299
00:29:49,85 --> 00:29:57,42
So within a short time from i would say from seventy four through to seventy i had a sense of community had been

300
00:29:57,42 --> 00:30:02,68
created that was strong enough to defend the values of the community. And make them real.

301
00:30:02,68 --> 00:30:10,15
And it had went from strength to strength from then on i think. You look at a number of influences on the north coast.

302
00:30:10,15 --> 00:30:12,29
And trace them to a.
