1
00:00:19,83 --> 00:00:27,03
Yeah children grow up with children around the area although we're six kilometers they have newman

2
00:00:27,03 --> 00:00:35,44
and their children attended to copy camp. Local school here. Don our youngest girl did go to nimbin high school.

3
00:00:36,12 --> 00:00:44,47
And they were. They played sport. And everything in nimble. With and against the local. All the alternate you'll run.

4
00:00:44,82 --> 00:00:49,36
And there was no problem and i think. The children are they mind.

5
00:00:49,36 --> 00:01:07,07
Thing that we've got to look at for to assimilate both groups. Into a better. Functioning community. Well.

6
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:10,7
For years has been from low points and high points in. Year.

7
00:01:10,7 --> 00:01:19,33
From a low point of view in some of the and a very small percentage i've got to emphasize of the alternative.

8
00:01:19,33 --> 00:01:28,19
Are extremists. And when it comes to such is it a local just likely in the story to just being in. Installed now.

9
00:01:28,19 --> 00:01:33,93
We've had right arguments against it. We've had community consultation and.

10
00:01:33,93 --> 00:01:40,15
Unfortunately the extremist will not accept a democratic vote in other words a majority vote

11
00:01:40,15 --> 00:01:43,39
and they're still campaigning against it.

12
00:01:43,39 --> 00:01:47,67
And we've had a situation where one of them's even said that when the sort

13
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:52,39
when the public toilets will be filled with cement when it is finished are that some of the low points.

14
00:01:52,39 --> 00:01:59,33
But the high points are when they all turn at them so. Taking part in community affairs and i mean.

15
00:01:59,33 --> 00:02:03,75
The community face much of progress associations right part associations

16
00:02:03,75 --> 00:02:13,65
and taking an active part in the community affairs. And that is the biggest proportion of them. And i do not want.

17
00:02:13,65 --> 00:02:19,95
Extremists at all. I would rather do without them and. It is i.

18
00:02:19,95 --> 00:02:25,68
A situation where i think the high point really out why the low point and.

19
00:02:25,68 --> 00:02:32,79
I'm happy to be a member of the newman community are going to show you. So.

20
00:02:34,96 --> 00:02:37,8
Yes a

21
00:02:37,8 --> 00:02:43,93
and i think that's probably one of the worst situations that all of the disadvantages probably all the aquarius first

22
00:02:43,93 --> 00:02:49,49
of all it's. Stigmatized. The village as a hippie. Capital of the strata.

23
00:02:49,49 --> 00:02:58,14
Not only the state and that is something i don't think that the community will ever live day on. It is something that.

24
00:02:58,14 --> 00:03:04,16
As i mentioned a while ago the alternative don't even want that stigmatized and that why i think the other.

25
00:03:04,16 --> 00:03:10,27
Down one is the drugs thing the did follow the aquarius festival on a budget can't all be blamed on it

26
00:03:10,27 --> 00:03:13,39
but it's different from that tong and.

27
00:03:13,39 --> 00:03:16,43
It's a problem that started to take a lot to overcome

28
00:03:16,43 --> 00:03:24,33
but there are quite a few organizations in the community at the present stage.

29
00:03:24,33 --> 00:03:26,16
Campaigning with the police and the local state

30
00:03:26,16 --> 00:03:31,61
and federal government to try to do something about it to clean it up the street thing is not very very good at all of

31
00:03:31,61 --> 00:03:40,04
the presidents died. And i think that is the one bad thing really that kind. From as well as the stigma ties. Asian.

32
00:03:40,04 --> 00:03:49,45
It came from the quest festival that it's going to take a lot to live down. So it's.

33
00:03:51,78 --> 00:04:02,42
Well it's got the image that if you want an easy life with something like this to come to newman it's there. And.

34
00:04:02,42 --> 00:04:09,53
I live far enough out of newman. Not to be caught up in a too much as i said six kilometers or why. But it is not good.

35
00:04:09,53 --> 00:04:14,64
On the street at the present stage and. Talking to developers that are developing around him.

36
00:04:14,69 --> 00:04:18,26
At the president's day you're coming in contact with this.

37
00:04:18,26 --> 00:04:23,29
When they're trying to sell properties when they're trying to sell a box full building.

38
00:04:23,29 --> 00:04:32,34
They're coming against a little bit of animosity or. Rebellion to be the wrong word against.

39
00:04:32,34 --> 00:04:37,54
Bombing i block in newman and that's one of the things that i think it's got to be overcome. And.

40
00:04:37,54 --> 00:04:41,9
It'll need a lot of work. While the alternative. Why the local community.

41
00:04:41,9 --> 00:04:56,45
To overcome all these problems but i think it can be done. Once. It's. Only the extremists. Not wanting any change.

42
00:04:56,45 --> 00:05:05,98
They the majority of the alternatives saudi most certainly don't mind any great change providing the environment is

43
00:05:05,98 --> 00:05:14,04
looked after providing all the ordinances of the council are abided by there doesn't seem to be any problem with them.

44
00:05:14,04 --> 00:05:21,62
But there is i. A section. And i said they. They extremists. Don't want any change whatever.

45
00:05:21,62 --> 00:05:29,9
And even campaign at a local auction a stopping market until people got to bali. What things.

46
00:05:38,15 --> 00:05:44,53
Probably the nice things that i've had a complaint against the. The extremists.

47
00:05:44,53 --> 00:05:55,78
Would be a situation where multiple occupancies. On properties. And on my own counsel that i've had lots of problems.

48
00:05:56,54 --> 00:06:04,39
I've got nothing against multiple occupancy at all providing that they have got community titles.

49
00:06:05,61 --> 00:06:12,33
Providing all the ordinance of council are abided by. And all the recommendations laid down for fire control.

50
00:06:12,33 --> 00:06:14,64
For environment control are abided by.

51
00:06:15,59 --> 00:06:22,25
Exactly the same as any other developers required to do that unfortunately has not been done by a lot of the multiple

52
00:06:22,25 --> 00:06:29,96
occupancy. In the area. Now there are in the police district sixty seven multiple occupancies.

53
00:06:31,38 --> 00:06:35,5
They're not all legal some of the been done in the county don't even know anything about them.

54
00:06:35,5 --> 00:06:41,31
So we've got a real big problem was filed multiple awkwardly duncanson some of which.

55
00:06:41,31 --> 00:06:44,99
Legal and some of which are working and functioning exceptionally well.

56
00:06:44,99 --> 00:06:49,53
And i've got no problem with them at all but i certainly have a problem with that.

57
00:06:49,53 --> 00:06:58,42
Any of the one to not abiding by council ordinances. The building codes. They hold.

58
00:06:58,42 --> 00:07:06,05
Provisions for the it for the sake of the environment. Of the community. So.

59
00:07:13,72 --> 00:07:21,68
He's history and had multiple options to be guided right away back to the nine hundred seventy three seventy four

60
00:07:21,68 --> 00:07:23,37
when a tunnel falls coordinate

61
00:07:23,37 --> 00:07:28,44
and cooperate of come into being mediterranean shark council it was the first one on the.

62
00:07:28,44 --> 00:07:33,15
I think the whole of the northeast corner at least of the state of new south wilds.

63
00:07:33,15 --> 00:07:42,87
And it was like a guinea pig being a council on the council that time. Had a job to come to grips with it and.

64
00:07:42,87 --> 00:07:50,13
It got off the ground. Not unanimous but what a six count was on the council.

65
00:07:50,13 --> 00:07:54,97
But a mind thing that's why indeed majority of the councils where they said that they want to do their own thing.

66
00:07:54,97 --> 00:07:56,25
And look after themselves.

67
00:07:56,25 --> 00:08:01,24
Don't tie gainey part in community affairs and have no problem say and i want to do their own thing

68
00:08:01,24 --> 00:08:07,54
and get off that ult. Now that's why the whole council not the whole council but the majority of council to vote.

69
00:08:07,54 --> 00:08:16,18
To let it go ahead. Since that time we've had i the history of multiple occupancy and. And the council.

70
00:08:16,86 --> 00:08:21,00
It has been fragmented.

71
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:27,56
Whole lot has been illegal buildings go up there's been threats of taking him down with the bulldozer.

72
00:08:27,56 --> 00:08:32,59
We have the on bud's minute stepped in and a couple of occasions we have had.

73
00:08:32,59 --> 00:08:41,98
Ministers of the state stepping in on terrible occasions and. There have not been a good ideas on between.

74
00:08:41,98 --> 00:08:47,42
Building codes hilt. Regulations. With multiple occupancies and with the councils.

75
00:08:47,42 --> 00:08:52,52
Even now the lismore city council which are has in effect most of these multiple documentaries.

76
00:09:01,59 --> 00:09:06,92
Or i suppose one of the worst examples i can think of at the present studied that mean quite a few.

77
00:09:06,92 --> 00:09:12,11
But one of the worst examples was i would turn my knee a creek.

78
00:09:12,11 --> 00:09:18,98
And i think i'm right in their wallets and road i'm sorry that's the one we had lots of problems over there and.

79
00:09:18,98 --> 00:09:25,23
With mine and we even had about three council inspections with all alderman and administration staff and.

80
00:09:25,23 --> 00:09:31,07
We just could not get off the ground. That we tried to force the ordinances on them.

81
00:09:31,07 --> 00:09:37,88
And the on budget and other ministers of state to step in and stop is doing any real thing about it

82
00:09:37,88 --> 00:09:46,03
and that's what i feel that it has not been a good thing as far as state and local government.

83
00:09:46,03 --> 00:09:49,45
Relationships are concerned. When i wouldn't back. The local government.

84
00:09:49,45 --> 00:10:02,04
Up in we were trying to rectify a problem that was caused by multiple occupancy development. Illegal buildings.

85
00:10:02,04 --> 00:10:10,29
They are not even a development application or building up like i can put into council. I had houses. Resting on.

86
00:10:10,29 --> 00:10:19,89
Logs on the ground that. Fall in the forest. They had houses built in the forest with not opposed.

87
00:10:19,89 --> 00:10:31,69
At least a meter of material that. Combustion material that would burn at the least thing to start it off and.

88
00:10:31,69 --> 00:10:34,97
We just couldn't get into their heads that they needed protection.

89
00:10:35,56 --> 00:10:44,49
I had no protection them so they expected the council to provide everything. That some of the really bad cases.

90
00:10:44,49 --> 00:11:09,91
All of them of not being that bad. This time and the other one across the other side of it. That was the argument.

91
00:11:09,91 --> 00:11:19,44
And i certainly that. Blamed a lot of white. To have the concession that the council. That they got away with council.

92
00:11:19,66 --> 00:11:26,33
But i don't believe that they should be treated any other different to any other one they've got to abide by their

93
00:11:26,33 --> 00:11:27,19
regulations.

94
00:11:27,19 --> 00:11:34,64
And most certainly the regulations regarding multiple documented all these type of building it most certainly is law.

95
00:11:34,64 --> 00:11:39,9
So i feel it's lower than than the other building for any other developer that developing in the community.

96
00:11:45,12 --> 00:11:49,4
Now they shouldn't be treated any differently at all like in other words.

97
00:11:49,4 --> 00:11:55,35
Irrespective of what the building conditions are if they agreed to that they must do it and.

98
00:11:55,35 --> 00:12:01,72
Unfortunately they go ahead and put a put i building up that doesn't conform in any shape or form.

99
00:12:01,72 --> 00:12:10,15
And then we've got or will the council has big problems and. Whether they can pull it down or knock it down and.

100
00:12:10,15 --> 00:12:14,64
Which things were very very. Not in this council but in the local in the.

101
00:12:15,17 --> 00:12:22,39
The neighboring council of goggle weird i've had to please dean and. There's been very very big. Unrest over.

102
00:12:22,39 --> 00:12:31,51
In three or four day program. Of pulling the houses apart and council having to do that. So yes.

103
00:12:32,31 --> 00:12:37,77
It is a very drastic measure but however i believe that they bring it on themselves when they don't boy.

104
00:12:37,77 --> 00:12:41,3
Abide like they greet to in the first place to get the development.

105
00:12:41,3 --> 00:13:00,52
And then when they get the development they go ahead and do whatever they want to do. And that is wrong. Yes. You say.

106
00:13:00,52 --> 00:13:02,92
Yes but he and i agree what you saya but how we have.

107
00:13:02,92 --> 00:13:08,68
They've been here and there that they are not causing any problem for anyone else either.

108
00:13:08,68 --> 00:13:12,23
And some of them are taking part in the community affairs

109
00:13:12,23 --> 00:13:17,91
and hoping to shape the community as i would like to see it done and that ought to like to see them all doing.

110
00:13:17,91 --> 00:13:19,79
Instead of the extremists getting out and.

111
00:13:19,79 --> 00:13:28,77
Lying down in front of bulldozers or or chainsaws or something to that effect. But.

112
00:13:35,4 --> 00:13:43,8
Yes some of the buildings that were inspected. Left a hell of a lot to be desired and. They were an old reason.

113
00:13:43,8 --> 00:13:48,3
I'll buy olds and. Even cream sheds.

114
00:13:48,3 --> 00:13:52,08
And things like it to start it off and they were slapped up a bit of blue plastic

115
00:13:52,08 --> 00:13:58,11
and stuff like at the on the only thing they had from where the board but they'd be the worst ones.

116
00:13:58,11 --> 00:14:05,99
There were the others that almost. Would conform to building regulations but they never ever got permission to do it.

117
00:14:05,99 --> 00:14:11,33
And that was a problem they didn't want to get permission they just went ahead. But if they had of went ahead.

118
00:14:11,33 --> 00:14:20,77
They or their house would have been very noble to be. To be modified. Without any real great effort on their pop.

119
00:14:20,77 --> 00:14:31,65
To my get fit the building codes and that they didn't do. Are you can't hear.

120
00:14:31,65 --> 00:14:36,25
They local policeman was called on to the young.

121
00:14:36,25 --> 00:14:42,9
Showground to talk to a fellow all put a following that was causing a disturbance at the local child

122
00:14:42,9 --> 00:14:54,56
or up to the local shop. And he would have had to have a bottle of tequila and a bottle of scotch and..

123
00:14:48,95 --> 00:14:55,11
And a better king of beer to get in the condition he was seen and heard running around brandishing i.e. Acts.

124
00:14:55,11 --> 00:14:56,98
In his hand.

125
00:14:56,98 --> 00:15:02,86
So i mean my local policeman you who it was so he got about three more pleased to connect them is more and i went down.

126
00:15:04,22 --> 00:15:08,27
And the local policeman even they only went up to him and he said.

127
00:15:08,27 --> 00:15:12,43
You come on and are got to take you up to the play station.

128
00:15:12,43 --> 00:15:14,29
If that's all right he said he said take me in

129
00:15:14,29 --> 00:15:20,16
and getting my eat all of it i tried to view him a little bit of a police baton and he didn't across the need.

130
00:15:20,16 --> 00:15:26,93
That usually bring them down on in these pretty quickly baseball i never even turned i. Muscle.

131
00:15:26,93 --> 00:15:32,16
He put the met in these other hand he did because the other night.

132
00:15:32,16 --> 00:15:39,77
And they follow looked at he said look mighty said if i were you he said i put that away before i do something with it.

133
00:15:39,77 --> 00:15:55,47
And he did. You never even feel duty that the job of that or you to call him. Now you to call him a indian.

134
00:15:55,47 --> 00:15:59,18
Indian something you're the big man they take you to three bottles.

135
00:15:59,18 --> 00:16:02,86
The killer the game and let's not had any running along the street with the ex and frightening at everyone

136
00:16:02,86 --> 00:16:10,08
but never hurt anyone but the local policeman didn't like him at all he thought he said you were dangerous with cancer.

137
00:16:11,15 --> 00:16:17,00
So he put the baton back in the thing like you and acting politely to get in the. In the vein we did.

138
00:16:24,79 --> 00:16:31,15
I suppose one of the great characters and you're probably interviewing him. The fellow called harry ending.

139
00:16:31,91 --> 00:16:40,14
Harry comes from tunnel force coordination cooperative he's been there since nineteen seventy two seventy three.

140
00:16:40,14 --> 00:16:45,24
Harry was always very thin we always thought that harry would never see the next winter.

141
00:16:45,24 --> 00:16:45,57
But harry

142
00:16:45,57 --> 00:16:52,97
and lisa cohen the truck driver could use to drive the truck that used to go to brisbane bring back their supplies.

143
00:16:52,97 --> 00:16:54,1
Of vegetables and stuff.

144
00:16:55,13 --> 00:17:01,06
However we all didn't how we'd see the next winter yet each year when part was over the next we'd all get him.

145
00:17:01,06 --> 00:17:02,76
And we have a hairy ending of.

146
00:17:03,81 --> 00:17:10,14
I think he's president of the progress association of the present stage he does a lot for community affairs he does a

147
00:17:10,14 --> 00:17:16,47
lot for people in sport and he helps kids and money another and. To my knowledge kerry did not marry.

148
00:17:16,47 --> 00:17:23,04
And i can assure you we had one fine gentleman was harry any better he's one of the old identities of nimbin that.

149
00:17:23,04 --> 00:17:28,01
Everyone in human. Likes and appreciates he's a tremendous fellow he looked up to everyone in human.
