1
00:00:13,4 --> 00:00:20,15
We put it on your daughter application. Larry. Oh they wasn't as a practicing addict. In this area there wasn't.

2
00:00:20,15 --> 00:00:29,47
There wasn't the volunteers there wasn't the prawn wasn't the prostitution there wasn't all asshole marks.

3
00:00:29,47 --> 00:00:38,57
Of addiction that. My. My friends in the city. When through. I was a lot gentler like. In many ways like. We still.

4
00:00:38,57 --> 00:00:44,11
You know i think we were still a lot more physically active i mean we still climbed up and down mountains and hills

5
00:00:44,11 --> 00:00:54,27
and cost of war her and. We still seem to use a lot more. Yeah addiction has a lock on that.

6
00:00:54,27 --> 00:01:04,93
To me out here than it would have been in the cities for sure. Laid away without a doubt closer.

7
00:01:04,93 --> 00:01:18,43
Question mark wright is a rock. I guess son his son and sid you know.

8
00:01:18,43 --> 00:01:22,17
Life is a lot kind of frederick's in the country all the country addicts that i know and.

9
00:01:22,17 --> 00:01:30,34
In my own experience applies in this is well. We just didn't have to do what pearl city attics. To do and then.

10
00:01:30,34 --> 00:01:35,24
I never had to cross shoot myself you know i didn't have to steal from people other than just you know.

11
00:01:35,24 --> 00:01:43,21
Charging to six open and mounts of money for you know i didn't have to. You know sell my soul to be an addict here and.

12
00:01:43,21 --> 00:01:46,85
You know like god. If i couldn't get it together to cook a meal i could always find the right.

13
00:01:46,85 --> 00:01:53,65
Go and have a meal there i mean i think that kept me alive it kept me out of trouble for a really long time.

14
00:01:53,65 --> 00:01:58,47
You know the id time i ever did go shoot a city and.

15
00:01:58,47 --> 00:02:02,86
You know i was a practicing addict i mean it was just terrific i had a really hard time for about three

16
00:02:02,86 --> 00:02:11,3
or four months until i could get it together to come home again and. I think. I mean from a lot.

17
00:02:11,96 --> 00:02:18,25
Up front about my diction of course everybody knew. But i didn't go around discussing it with paypal and i guess.

18
00:02:18,25 --> 00:02:23,35
I didn't pick up. Heroin. I had about three years of.

19
00:02:23,35 --> 00:02:29,9
I think when i first came the country and when it wasn't here for a while and.

20
00:02:29,9 --> 00:02:33,8
You know i sort of did things in town i was part of the community

21
00:02:33,8 --> 00:02:41,39
and said people gave me a lot of leeway for a long time after i'd sort of because i'm a practicing heroin addict again.

22
00:02:41,39 --> 00:02:50,47
I think people still loved me and. You know i could get away with saying just this. You know junkie in town and.

23
00:02:50,47 --> 00:02:56,05
I mean that had a lot to do with the progression of my disease to you know like. You start off as this sort of.

24
00:02:56,05 --> 00:03:01,79
Guy young thing. And it takes a long time to the disease of addiction to way down and.

25
00:03:01,79 --> 00:03:06,87
You know about the tunnels thirty two. I was a pretty you know i was a pretty want to.

26
00:03:06,87 --> 00:03:10,68
Junkie and i don't want a lot of my friendships and a lot of my family by that time and.

27
00:03:10,68 --> 00:03:15,42
I guess the only thing i've gone for it was that i was a country junkie

28
00:03:15,42 --> 00:03:23,03
and that i could survive a lot more easily here. In terms of. I guess muff my physical self and masaki than i could.

29
00:03:23,03 --> 00:03:38,38
As city junkie as well i was always one of those sort of junkies that. Kept a lot of fronts up.

30
00:03:38,38 --> 00:03:43,42
So i was my son was always very well dressed and.

31
00:03:43,42 --> 00:03:48,3
You know there was always money for shoes and food and so on and i kept it from him.

32
00:03:48,3 --> 00:03:56,17
That was a junkyard very protected humorous a lot of people don't do that so much. I certainly didn't.

33
00:03:56,17 --> 00:04:02,92
And i mean my mothering front was great because i could side of myself i'm not too bad a junkie because my kids.

34
00:04:02,92 --> 00:04:04,31
Does that mean the other.

35
00:04:04,31 --> 00:04:11,3
And so that was another part of my i don't know about the process of my diction bicycling in the.

36
00:04:11,57 --> 00:04:13,26
You know he grew up around smoking.

37
00:04:13,26 --> 00:04:17,48
But everybody's kids do you know the cops come to our house one day the bastards

38
00:04:17,48 --> 00:04:23,76
and max out on a bad diet like a pillow and that was his you know.

39
00:04:23,76 --> 00:04:29,08
Big climb to find the you know the cops kind of not set on the dark night in finding. And.

40
00:04:29,08 --> 00:04:34,9
I mean most people's kids are probably in that position in that. We all had to tell our children that.

41
00:04:34,9 --> 00:04:39,51
You know what we smoke is a label and so if anybody ever asks you about it at school

42
00:04:39,51 --> 00:04:45,18
or whatever we do not do that thing and and. That was just reality so.

43
00:04:45,18 --> 00:04:52,92
It was always brought up within the framework of that. Illegality i suppose and. I'm it's not colleagues.

44
00:04:52,92 --> 00:04:56,99
Was uncool in the early dies but so is alcohol so i mean we never went and sat in pubs

45
00:04:56,99 --> 00:05:04,47
or anything like that like if you're a good he'd be distant going to pubs in and out of going to pubs for about ten

46
00:05:04,47 --> 00:05:09,84
or twelve years it wasn't until we had the media ease that i even ventured into the newman pub

47
00:05:09,84 --> 00:05:16,28
and that was i just said that i started drinking. And also the kids that inboard up and.

48
00:05:16,28 --> 00:05:22,35
Within the framework of an extended family situation here i mean that's one of the. Things not. I mean.

49
00:05:23,21 --> 00:05:30,95
In country areas you have that but in communal. Societies like like. We live in here on main that. That.

50
00:05:30,95 --> 00:05:40,71
That's even more fundamental and then the kids get together and i hang around in groups and then we look after them.

51
00:05:40,71 --> 00:05:46,03
And i mean as a community really believe me. You know the kids and all the parents and all the kids and.

52
00:05:46,03 --> 00:05:51,08
All the kids want to get together and you're looking after these groups and so.

53
00:05:51,08 --> 00:05:56,7
And basically in that situation i mean people kerry i mean people.

54
00:05:56,7 --> 00:06:03,16
You know if people are having hard times whether it's through realizing ships' economics addiction whatever.

55
00:06:03,16 --> 00:06:08,49
I mean people get in there and say what's happening and help each other out and.

56
00:06:08,49 --> 00:06:11,3
I think that probably the kids suffered a lot less than.

57
00:06:11,35 --> 00:06:14,26
I would have a has in commission flat in the city

58
00:06:14,26 --> 00:06:19,7
or something on that as well i mean that's the thing about country addiction to i mean it is different to the city

59
00:06:19,7 --> 00:06:24,56
addiction or the city process of addiction and not magic not there are people with good with kids

60
00:06:24,56 --> 00:06:35,88
and so on who are city addicts but. I mean it's. It's a very different scenario where we all have lived and.

61
00:06:35,88 --> 00:06:41,11
We all had kids and kids went to school together in a dive to each other and.

62
00:06:41,11 --> 00:06:43,23
And we looked after each other's kids as well

63
00:06:43,23 --> 00:06:49,77
and so you know it was it was a really different trip to an os lighted site if you're living in a flat

64
00:06:49,77 --> 00:06:55,68
and some killed or somewhere in the dark. Other mothers like. We all knew everybody like we did.

65
00:06:55,68 --> 00:06:58,64
And we'd go to the school you know like we would put on dark glasses

66
00:06:58,64 --> 00:07:22,99
and go to the school fight because we were still part of the community. You know it's interesting you know. Yeah. Yeah.

67
00:07:22,99 --> 00:07:32,09
I think it's very very hard in that paper kind of rifle. I think is very hard. In terms of.

68
00:07:32,09 --> 00:07:40,46
Community notions of addiction because people kind of arrive by addicts. And say them as the monstrous other.

69
00:07:40,46 --> 00:07:47,35
And i say them as. Somebody to be really feeling people forget that.

70
00:07:47,35 --> 00:07:53,4
Everybody has an addict or an alcoholic in their families and i put the two into the category.

71
00:07:53,4 --> 00:07:58,06
I had an uncle who is an alcoholic. Somebody else has a sister who was an alcoholic.

72
00:07:58,77 --> 00:08:07,87
Somebody has a husband who's a drug addict you know and. It's really important to not let humans. Humanness. Flour why.

73
00:08:07,87 --> 00:08:13,47
Flow out the dry and. I think that when people talk about the. Addicts. And the drug problem.

74
00:08:13,69 --> 00:08:16,33
I just forget it's a person who lives in the house next door

75
00:08:16,33 --> 00:08:20,4
and it's really really important to have that sort of notion of compassion

76
00:08:20,4 --> 00:08:27,41
and humanness with with talking about the problem because otherwise you can't get any any community kind of.

77
00:08:27,41 --> 00:08:30,56
Cohesiveness happening. If you split the community you don't.

78
00:08:30,56 --> 00:08:35,06
You don't have to in fact search for the solution you can just shove.

79
00:08:35,06 --> 00:08:40,65
Shove the people out of the community you can shut you know close down the methadone program. Shut down and they look.

80
00:08:40,65 --> 00:08:45,2
And then you have people starting to die. And then you have people starting to get desperate.

81
00:08:45,2 --> 00:08:49,36
And again you have you know. Possibly a serious problem happening held sway but you know.

82
00:08:49,36 --> 00:08:55,83
Probably a serious problem still happening here i mean there are kind of concrete.

83
00:08:55,83 --> 00:09:05,34
Solvable solution is happening this is just the idea i think that we have to look at the problem as a community.

84
00:09:05,34 --> 00:09:10,86
And and try and sort of. Say the people with problems.

85
00:09:10,86 --> 00:09:15,63
As our friends you know and i mean that's really hard for people who don't personally know.

86
00:09:15,63 --> 00:09:23,07
The addicts like you just walk past people outside the right by side. And say some. You know person it's really hard.

87
00:09:23,07 --> 00:09:30,91
It's really easy to sort of unify the nation and and. Things get hot dark to you know people sit around in groups.

88
00:09:30,91 --> 00:09:32,62
Talking about. The problem.

89
00:09:32,62 --> 00:09:35,77
And i just say you know something's got to be done about it something's got to be done about it.

90
00:09:35,77 --> 00:09:50,88
But i mean that by simply just prompt some kind of vigilante action rather than a part of a positive solution.

91
00:09:50,88 --> 00:09:53,46
Don't go. So.

92
00:09:53,46 --> 00:09:59,79
Well i think one thing i think part of the reason it's visible is because i think women's drug problem is necessarily

93
00:09:59,79 --> 00:10:05,45
worse than that a lot about apply science probably better than i want to i we've got friends who have moved here from

94
00:10:05,45 --> 00:10:06,34
darlinghurst.

95
00:10:06,34 --> 00:10:11,3
They can't believe the furore about the drug problem because i think this is heaven compared to what i know.

96
00:10:11,79 --> 00:10:19,98
Darlinghurst. I think the drug. You know. The problems with addiction.

97
00:10:19,98 --> 00:10:24,6
Everywhere i think one of the things about nim than i'm one of the healthy things about naman is that it's not.

98
00:10:24,6 --> 00:10:31,58
It's not kept behind closed doors and swept under the carpet. It's basically. Pretty much up front.

99
00:10:31,58 --> 00:10:39,14
And it's pretty pretty discussed on a community level and it's a nice try. And a lot of people try to address it.

100
00:10:39,14 --> 00:10:50,79
On this level. And there's a lot of played within the community trying to do something positive a bad. And so.

101
00:10:50,79 --> 00:11:00,83
Yeah it probably seems a lot worse than it is like i said before the drug problem in nimbin is because basically just a

102
00:11:00,83 --> 00:11:09,36
libel. Over simplified lives for a lot of other problems online. For homelessness for ten i'd run allies.

103
00:11:09,36 --> 00:11:15,84
For alcoholism. For poverty. Through all these sorts of things online people.

104
00:11:15,84 --> 00:11:22,64
I mean all those problems come under the live on the drug problem in most people's minds. Who are observing it.

105
00:11:22,64 --> 00:11:35,28
And we're small country ten. There's one straight. It's very visible. It's very visible and. What is visible is just.

106
00:11:35,28 --> 00:11:38,39
Young people sitting around outside the bible and whether

107
00:11:38,39 --> 00:11:45,12
or not they in fact have a drug problem isn't the point on the nine i will just the people who are drinking.

108
00:11:45,12 --> 00:11:49,4
For a while i mean most people go through problem. Drug and alcohol use.

109
00:11:49,4 --> 00:11:55,34
You know between the age of eighteen and twenty two than i do kids which is doing that. Really normal thing again.

110
00:11:55,34 --> 00:12:00,34
Doing it visibly. You know i don't i might just as easily just be you know.

111
00:12:00,34 --> 00:12:05,29
Fifteen year olds who don't want to go to school just sitting around trying to scare people.

112
00:12:05,29 --> 00:12:11,3
You know just looking groovy. Having fun and there's also this interest so i think that it's in it's in their.

113
00:12:11,38 --> 00:12:19,29
I think the certain vested interests that it's in there. To their advantage. To to clean up the tale.

114
00:12:19,29 --> 00:12:22,13
So that their businesses or properties

115
00:12:22,13 --> 00:12:28,15
or whatever that they're trying to sell to sort of reasonably affluent middle class people with.

116
00:12:28,15 --> 00:12:34,51
Because they will then where is his cell phone call us festival going. And i want to sell lend or war.

117
00:12:34,51 --> 00:12:41,57
War services or goods to them. I want the ten claim that because i think these people scare them.

118
00:12:41,57 --> 00:12:47,74
Will scare these people away and. So i think that there's this people whose.

119
00:12:47,74 --> 00:12:54,24
Illusions like arc of lucian's about the myth of nimon of being shattered by the reality.

120
00:12:54,24 --> 00:12:58,54
They've got to visit best interest in their allusions i want to find somebody to blame

121
00:12:58,54 --> 00:13:06,48
or they drain didn't come true and. I mean all these people got various vested interests in in beating up this.

122
00:13:06,48 --> 00:13:14,66
Heart about the drug problem in inman and really like. I don't think it's any worse than anywhere else.

123
00:13:14,66 --> 00:13:21,85
I think it's probably a lot healthier than other places because. Because a lot of us see it on a lot of.

124
00:13:21,85 --> 00:13:30,5
Because it is that it is up front. And i know it is being talked about and table trying to find solutions in its name.

125
00:13:30,5 --> 00:13:36,48
And i was thinking then you know. I see you particularly. Person who was really offended when he was asked if you want.

126
00:13:36,48 --> 00:13:46,1
By moving down the street and save these people to be sort of really kind of feast and drug addicts and.

127
00:13:46,1 --> 00:13:52,85
I see no difference between kids using. Or getting a bit pissed.

128
00:13:52,85 --> 00:13:59,06
And the why we all sat around twenty years ago getting really quite feisty and smoking. I mean.

129
00:13:59,06 --> 00:14:06,08
Is that acceptable is it acceptable to sort of sit in this mine straight. Really started and. And quite kind.

130
00:14:06,08 --> 00:14:11,3
On smoking. But not on other drugs like i think one of the hardest things about newman is that.

131
00:14:11,79 --> 00:14:19,53
This is drug specificity that it's ok to smoke. Smoking dope steal. And to me. That is held us back as a community.

132
00:14:19,53 --> 00:14:25,68
It's held a spec in terms of what people achieve in the community. I mean it's very much process and work i think but.

133
00:14:25,68 --> 00:14:29,45
You know like if you're sitting around smoking. You don't do as much.

134
00:14:29,45 --> 00:14:35,13
You don't have the most wonderful guns in the world maybe you don't. Sort of be as creative or whatever but.

135
00:14:35,13 --> 00:14:41,03
To make a drug is a drug is a drug and. There's just as many problems with people sitting around smoking.

136
00:14:41,03 --> 00:14:47,97
As there are you know. With drunks. Bating up on paypal. Always. You know people sticking needles in there saying.

137
00:14:47,97 --> 00:14:55,56
I mean this is this is sort of acceptability about drugs that. You know it's. It's ok to sit on straight.

138
00:14:55,56 --> 00:15:03,36
Or to sit somewhere. Smoking dope and it's not ok to use the other drugs and off on that really fancy.

139
00:15:03,36 --> 00:15:08,29
The bottom line is always people got their own barrier to push in the play ball.

140
00:15:08,29 --> 00:15:16,00
And the people who get vilified in the most power. Palace playboy in the community by sadly. The young.

141
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:26,39
Harmless kids the addicks. The sock patients have been kicked out of the their half why. Has is these are the people.

142
00:15:26,39 --> 00:15:27,81
These the table that.

143
00:15:27,81 --> 00:15:36,44
Always problems everywhere has got their blind for some reason and then plain old man it makes it all very simple

144
00:15:36,44 --> 00:15:42,98
and easy if we can just blind everything on these sort of outlandish. Added looking scruffy paypal.

145
00:15:42,98 --> 00:15:46,94
Wondering just get rid of them then everything will be i can and.

146
00:15:46,94 --> 00:15:51,21
And the people sitting around getting drunk in the pub think you know.

147
00:15:51,21 --> 00:15:54,13
It's all a problem and if we go out and beat up a couple of them

148
00:15:54,13 --> 00:16:03,88
and teach them a lesson you know everything will be ok and. You know it's just. Silo wise just silo. Wide off the mark.

149
00:16:03,88 --> 00:16:11,3
Yet this simplistic. Simplistic sort of vigilante sort of.

150
00:16:11,4 --> 00:16:16,33
The loss of his his push to the wife of solving always problems all.

151
00:16:16,33 --> 00:16:22,25
Always someone it's funny because in many many ways newman was about being marginal on the end.

152
00:16:22,25 --> 00:16:29,96
Twenty years ago we were all very marginalized by our attitudes and ideologies at the time.

153
00:16:29,96 --> 00:16:36,87
And you know as i said before fashions china. And. And i guess we grow older and and.

154
00:16:36,87 --> 00:16:45,38
The marginal become more offensive to see many well yes. You know i still do i get. I don't like.

155
00:16:45,38 --> 00:16:53,11
Charges because i smell. You know like i reckon people can always have a birdbath or whatever but.

156
00:16:53,11 --> 00:17:00,93
You know that sort of thing of. Of the. The module do become the status quo. Yeah. And we have become the status quo.

157
00:17:00,93 --> 00:17:09,97
And stuff like that. When i was using drugs. I used to work in the rainforest because our grass.

158
00:17:09,97 --> 00:17:17,57
Got they to grow dark and. Look at things like huge strength of ons.

159
00:17:17,57 --> 00:17:24,39
That were quite extraordinary and i got got i'm so lucky to live here and look at this sort of thing.

160
00:17:24,39 --> 00:17:26,00
And i could recognise that intellectually

161
00:17:26,00 --> 00:17:33,97
but i only realised after i got clean from all drugs that in fact i had no connection with that reality and.

162
00:17:33,97 --> 00:17:41,3
Probably the best part about living here from a particular living he totally drug free is to look at my environment

163
00:17:41,3 --> 00:17:51,27
and to be part of my own bond. And in some kind of connection with it on a spiritual level and. Just feel a real.

164
00:17:51,27 --> 00:17:59,81
Numinous joy in that. And i don't. Experience that. In other places. As much as i do here.

165
00:17:59,81 --> 00:18:07,66
I mean i can walk in parts of sydney and feel that in parts of melbourne i mean it's not a peculiarly.

166
00:18:07,66 --> 00:18:16,08
Country experienced by any by any stretch but i. You feel. And here we go into the realms of the arcane.

167
00:18:16,08 --> 00:18:22,1
I do feel that newman is. Is a very special spot. Not for the people.

168
00:18:22,1 --> 00:18:29,79
Not for anything that we've done in the last two hundred years here. But i'd. I do feel it as.

169
00:18:29,79 --> 00:18:37,26
As one of those places that. Use very magical moments siani would you can describe it some.

170
00:18:37,26 --> 00:18:46,2
Sometimes hear your heart leaps out. In a really beautiful why and. I always get homesick for this area.

171
00:18:46,2 --> 00:18:50,95
And want and want to come home and. I suppose you know any place can become home.

172
00:18:50,95 --> 00:18:57,18
But for me this pain this place has become a very special spot.

173
00:18:58,52 --> 00:19:07,43
And i guess the people to you know like the people who star eight. Are a lot of fun.

174
00:19:08,59 --> 00:19:15,02
You know and people have come and gone i've the years and i mean night. You know have the applies here.

175
00:19:15,02 --> 00:19:24,7
But for the people who came here. And decided to stay and have just kept on year after year. I mean we are a community.

176
00:19:24,7 --> 00:19:30,17
And that. That sense of communities. Is very special also because.

177
00:19:30,17 --> 00:19:32,99
Certainly i mean i've lived in other country towns you can walk down the street.

178
00:19:32,99 --> 00:19:39,84
And you cannot inside hello to everybody but. I mean we share a continuity and can continue in here.

179
00:19:39,84 --> 00:19:53,06
But that goes back over a long time and. And that's a special thing to. Largest think that the really.

180
00:19:53,06 --> 00:19:58,69
The really strong thing about the community up here is the fact that we do. Really sort of.

181
00:19:58,69 --> 00:20:08,54
Cherish a dog versity a papal warming here. The junkie's came come morning behind the kids come. The ferals come.

182
00:20:08,54 --> 00:20:14,48
The saw our patients come. Give me a. And i you know. Well the thing here.

183
00:20:14,48 --> 00:20:20,65
Basically all these people come and and they tell you can they tighten is they i mean.

184
00:20:20,65 --> 00:20:24,98
They're not vilified for that they're. If on me.

185
00:20:24,98 --> 00:20:28,68
If i want to get on in the community they're excepted the doors i've been on in life

186
00:20:28,68 --> 00:20:35,01
and get on the dog versity here is that the humans is pretty much cherished

187
00:20:35,01 --> 00:20:43,52
and i think i think that's a fantastic thing. I think that's the issue that's going on at the moment i mean.

188
00:20:43,52 --> 00:20:46,76
The pressures in it so it's a saudi i mean.

189
00:20:46,76 --> 00:20:53,42
They want to marginalize people like that that's the global sort of pressure. Marginalize everything.

190
00:20:53,42 --> 00:21:05,7
I mean what you've got here is. Is incredible. An incredible range of. Just all sorts and nine year olds and and.

191
00:21:05,7 --> 00:21:12,58
And just all sorts of people and we get on and on then we do get on and.

192
00:21:12,58 --> 00:21:20,99
And the community as a whole does really resist this. Pressure to marginalize and this is pressure to.

193
00:21:21,53 --> 00:21:28,64
To vilify are not gentle paypal and. I think that's the strength of this community and that's and that's.

194
00:21:28,64 --> 00:21:36,92
That's what a lot of play i mean a lot of the al sit was who have been here a long time. Online.

195
00:21:36,92 --> 00:21:44,54
That's where our strength law is in. You know a desire to to preserve the diversity not any of the rainforests.

196
00:21:44,54 --> 00:21:51,3
But that of. The fumin culture and people and all that the different subcultures that exist and.

197
00:21:51,3 --> 00:21:57,9
And i think that's one in all go on and that's why she's like a drug addiction. Will be sort of kicked a bad out.

198
00:21:57,9 --> 00:22:03,72
And keep the bad. You know in the out and that's why.

199
00:22:03,72 --> 00:22:11,3
That's why when when when when commercial and economic pressures come on. On to this community. To clean itself up and.

200
00:22:11,47 --> 00:22:19,55
You know i rub out the messy bits and to move them on. Online. The community will push back. Because.

201
00:22:19,55 --> 00:22:27,89
I think that diversity is. Is where our strength flaw is and i think. I think you know my entire. You know against.

202
00:22:27,89 --> 00:22:31,3
Against the laid all. The commercial.

203
00:22:32,62 --> 00:22:42,07
You know the cultural pressures of we're bombarded with and i think that's the strength. Community and one reason our.
