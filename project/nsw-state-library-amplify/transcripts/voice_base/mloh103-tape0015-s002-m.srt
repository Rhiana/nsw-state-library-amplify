1
00:00:06,72 --> 00:00:14,7
You know the central keep shining. The window keep blowing. The rain will keep falling. These are all things that the.

2
00:00:14,7 --> 00:00:27,12
Keep happening for as long as there's life on earth you know that we don't. We don't need to have these insane.

3
00:00:27,12 --> 00:00:32,94
Power systems that pollute the planet. And require lots of maintenance and stuff anymore you know the.

4
00:00:32,94 --> 00:00:38,67
Technology is there today. To provide power at one's fingertips.

5
00:00:38,67 --> 00:01:04,81
Without having to having to flog one's guts out in order to maintain the systems. Well back in the seventy's.

6
00:01:04,81 --> 00:01:10,53
Or even further back in the sixty's a lot of people like myself.

7
00:01:10,53 --> 00:01:20,82
Held these views of the world as it was not being able to sustain itself very much longer.

8
00:01:20,82 --> 00:01:29,88
A lot of other people in mainstream society would say oh the reason these crazy stupid ideas you know.

9
00:01:29,88 --> 00:01:37,7
They were to come back to reality and see what it's all about but. It's amazing over the last twenty years here.

10
00:01:37,7 --> 00:01:51,5
And how people's. Acceptance of. The fact that we can't keep on going the way we were has changed. Now.

11
00:01:51,5 --> 00:01:57,42
Where i was an extremist. Twenty years ago. Now my ideas are accepted everywhere.

12
00:01:57,42 --> 00:02:07,05
You know so i think there's been some amazing changes there. The problem is that although.

13
00:02:07,05 --> 00:02:14,97
People are all aware of what the shortcomings of. Of society as it as it stands.

14
00:02:14,97 --> 00:02:17,82
Still not very many people are really prepared to change their own life.

15
00:02:18,89 --> 00:02:24,04
You know they all agree with the fact that something needs to be done. But there.

16
00:02:24,04 --> 00:02:29,01
Most people seem to be waiting for somebody else to lead the way.

17
00:02:29,01 --> 00:02:30,01
And i guess that's what the rain

18
00:02:30,01 --> 00:02:35,04
but there are companies about as we're trying to say look it's all here it's all available.

19
00:02:35,04 --> 00:02:36,93
When she just all do it now you know.

20
00:02:37,18 --> 00:02:46,24
And unfortunately one of the obstacles that we're still against at the moment is that. In this city.

21
00:02:46,24 --> 00:02:51,65
Suburban environment. You know power systems are not cost competitive with a grid system.

22
00:02:51,65 --> 00:02:54,54
They would be a lot more cost compared if the grid system.

23
00:02:54,54 --> 00:03:02,47
Was incorporated or the real costs of the system which i don't. But anyway. We as.

24
00:03:02,47 --> 00:03:04,27
Cost competitive in the rural environment.

25
00:03:05,7 --> 00:03:11,58
It's a pity that we're not the cost competitive yet in the city environment i guess that's just only a matter of time.

26
00:03:11,58 --> 00:03:16,56
Even even with the cross subsidise ation of systems the way they are today.

27
00:03:19,64 --> 00:03:23,82
If that doesn't change we were still become cost competitive in the next decade or so.

28
00:03:23,82 --> 00:03:42,45
Just because technology is improving and. Renewable energy system to get improving all the time around products.

29
00:03:42,45 --> 00:03:46,81
You know they're aimed at power company products that we have for sale include.

30
00:03:46,81 --> 00:03:58,14
The micro hydro system and when i was telling you there. We also developed a sine wave inverter.

31
00:03:58,14 --> 00:04:06,53
An inverter is something that gives you a high voltage a seat like two forty volts ac from better we supply.

32
00:04:06,53 --> 00:04:14,7
Most inverters that. Vailable. The nowness. Modified square or stepdaughter square wave and.

33
00:04:14,7 --> 00:04:20,07
The problem with with those way forms out of the inverters is a lot of standard to forgive all equipment doesn't like

34
00:04:20,07 --> 00:04:31,7
it. And we felt that there was a great need. In america place for a sine wave.

35
00:04:32,09 --> 00:04:39,86
We went and developed their own sign maven the. Which turns out to be a very. Indestructible product.

36
00:04:40,03 --> 00:04:46,81
It's we believe it's one of the best inverters in the mcas and. Any equipment.

37
00:04:46,81 --> 00:04:51,65
Within the worth integrating of the invertible. Will run very happily off it.

38
00:04:51,65 --> 00:04:57,35
We're now in the process of making a large inverter the one that we had so if there was a three hundred what.

39
00:04:57,35 --> 00:05:04,44
Twelve often the. When they are developing a six hundred word. Inverted it's also got some other added features.

40
00:05:04,44 --> 00:05:12,85
It will actually reverse is a better judge as well. And we believe it's going to be a lot more efficient and.

41
00:05:12,85 --> 00:05:34,76
In the small than the it is. Yeah. It's. I always like to keep systems as simple as possible and.

42
00:05:34,76 --> 00:05:39,04
With that in mind it seems a lot more sensible if you have a better bank.

43
00:05:39,04 --> 00:05:42,25
To have things that run directly off the battery bank.

44
00:05:42,25 --> 00:05:46,31
Then to have things standard to forgive all appliances for which you need an inverter.

45
00:05:46,31 --> 00:05:55,04
The problem is that the same or different pieces of equipment and people might want to have some of them.

46
00:05:55,04 --> 00:05:58,33
Probably very difficult if not impossible to obtain as a d.c.

47
00:05:58,33 --> 00:06:01,86
Appliance and we're not in the business of trying to think of every possible appliance

48
00:06:01,86 --> 00:06:08,9
and making an alternative available. We tell people about the alternatives that we know about.

49
00:06:08,9 --> 00:06:14,96
And occasionally some of the more popular products will actually go out of her way to try and either.

50
00:06:14,96 --> 00:06:23,89
Source an alternative. One or many thanks one ourselves but. We are mainly about setting up our systems another bit.

51
00:06:23,89 --> 00:06:33,17
Supplying the appliances as well. What we usually recommend to people is to have. D.c.

52
00:06:33,17 --> 00:06:41,28
Lighting as much as possible and. Use d.c. Appliances wherever possible. That we're where. D.c.

53
00:06:41,28 --> 00:06:47,56
Appliances and available. Then you probably just get your stand ac appliance and run it. Via an inverter.

54
00:06:47,56 --> 00:06:56,59
So then we wanted to make an inverter available. That will give the minimum of. Problem with running these appliances.

55
00:06:58,81 --> 00:07:05,69
We have had problems with. D.c. Appliances in the past. Every once in a while we come across a really good.

56
00:07:05,69 --> 00:07:07,48
Twelve volt appliance.

57
00:07:07,48 --> 00:07:09,97
And we start selling it in six months

58
00:07:09,97 --> 00:07:16,52
or a year down the track we discover that the people that are doing the importing will manifest in that particular

59
00:07:16,52 --> 00:07:19,4
appliance don't feel. There's a big enough market place.

60
00:07:19,4 --> 00:07:23,57
Not selling enough of them and they decide to discontinue it even though there were.

61
00:07:23,57 --> 00:07:32,66
We were doing really well with them. So that's unfortunate. But i guess air power systems.

62
00:07:32,66 --> 00:07:40,99
Will be as dependable as what we you know if i don't say the company is going to go down and you go over it all.

63
00:07:40,99 --> 00:07:44,5
It's actually quite amazing you know where.

64
00:07:44,5 --> 00:07:50,88
Other small businesses have staggered in the forward probably ninety percent of business is a bit in your recent years

65
00:07:50,88 --> 00:07:55,33
the status of the. Forward bit in a year or so.

66
00:07:55,33 --> 00:08:01,89
Here we're growing at a phenomenal rate and not seeing any end of the growth rate. You know just goes on and.

67
00:08:01,89 --> 00:08:08,07
So the way things are looking i could see that. The rain that they're here in is here to stay and.

68
00:08:08,07 --> 00:08:27,24
We're going to get bigger and bigger. Structure here. Yeah. And i kist think i guess. I mean. It's interesting.

69
00:08:27,24 --> 00:08:33,21
There were identical years off and same to total chaos. You know but yet.

70
00:08:33,58 --> 00:08:38,47
If you look at the way we're running here or even or there were either all chiefs

71
00:08:38,47 --> 00:08:46,46
or all indians nobody really knows worth. We've got a working relationship here that really does work. You know.

72
00:08:46,46 --> 00:08:56,75
We all know who to see about what and who to communicate with and. It all seems to happen next. Exceptionally well.

73
00:08:56,75 --> 00:09:07,06
As i was saying we've got a structure whereby we don't have a pyramid structure at all. Everybody's on the same level.

74
00:09:07,06 --> 00:09:08,82
We're all in the same wage.

75
00:09:09,52 --> 00:09:22,99
No matter what you do have an equal opportunity and having some say in what goes on in the company. So i guess.

76
00:09:22,99 --> 00:09:31,83
I guess one of the things that makes it work is the. That we lift with the responsibility.

77
00:09:32,43 --> 00:09:37,38
Each one of us has got the responsibility you know it's not. We can't pass a responsibility on to somebody else.

78
00:09:39,75 --> 00:09:43,27
I guess take the attitude that each and every one of us is bit like a foreman.

79
00:09:43,27 --> 00:09:47,27
You know we've got to make sure the job is done and the job is done properly.

80
00:09:47,27 --> 00:09:54,66
In effect that we are all shareholders we're all proud owners of the company gives us a very direct interest in what

81
00:09:54,66 --> 00:10:15,05
goes on with a company. Well i don't know. I guess. We're all really proud of the company.

82
00:10:15,05 --> 00:10:22,69
You know we really like what we're doing and we we all have great regard for each other.

83
00:10:24,05 --> 00:10:41,29
I was thinking certainly i mean again. But you know it's got be busier than cancer. Gives you question again.

84
00:10:41,29 --> 00:10:50,03
Well i think. We have an incentive here. You can say. Nobody's going to get rich but i guess.

85
00:10:51,39 --> 00:10:54,85
Prosperous the company prospers all together. You know at the moment.

86
00:10:54,85 --> 00:10:59,75
We're getting very low wage rates just because we can't afford to increase of wage rates as yet

87
00:10:59,75 --> 00:11:02,18
but hopefully in the near future will be able to increase it

88
00:11:02,18 --> 00:11:10,36
and as a company prosperous their wage rates will an increase in altogether. The fact that we know that there's no.

89
00:11:10,36 --> 00:11:19,41
Not somebody. Amongst us to make an enormous amount of profit.

90
00:11:19,41 --> 00:11:25,24
And second forcing everybody else makes us feel much happy and then we know that. We're all equal.

91
00:11:25,31 --> 00:11:41,41
And it's quite amazing how we. Was the level of commitment within the company is actually quite the standing. You know.

92
00:11:41,41 --> 00:11:48,95
If you look at other companies and you look at the staff turnover. We've been going for for four years.

93
00:11:48,95 --> 00:11:55,67
And their staff turnover is incredibly low. You know. Most people that come and join us here this day.

94
00:11:55,67 --> 00:12:03,23
You know they're happy here and not really came to move on a new or else. I know from a self. That.

95
00:12:03,23 --> 00:12:06,09
I've worked at all sorts of jobs in my life

96
00:12:06,09 --> 00:12:10,14
and most of those jobs i didn't really win the nobel i wasn't happy with them. You know.

97
00:12:10,14 --> 00:12:16,69
And pat pat the reason for not being happy with those jobs because they were damaged in the environment.

98
00:12:16,69 --> 00:12:21,61
And the thank that i knew i was doing a job that was destructive. Didn't make me feel good. You know.

99
00:12:21,61 --> 00:12:28,82
And the fact that i was working for a boss no i didn't have. Have any chance of.

100
00:12:28,82 --> 00:12:33,26
Steering the company in different direction or anything just made me lose interest in it.

101
00:12:33,26 --> 00:12:40,42
You know whereas i think the way we've set up this company here. Is every incentive for people to speak up.

102
00:12:40,42 --> 00:12:41,25
To be involved.

103
00:12:42,83 --> 00:12:50,17
People can feel good about it because because we are doing something that we believe is good for the environment.

104
00:12:50,17 --> 00:13:00,02
We're about sitting there. Creating change in public awareness and creating change in. Stan.

105
00:13:00,02 --> 00:13:07,66
I was going to talk about standards of living. You know creating a change in the lifestyle.

106
00:13:07,66 --> 00:13:16,43
You know the thing about standard of living is that. It's often quite meaningless you know what really matters to us.

107
00:13:16,43 --> 00:13:26,65
Is quality of life. You know the fact that you've got. Toilet paper with with pretty flowers printed on it. You know.

108
00:13:26,65 --> 00:13:33,21
It does not improve one's quality of life but. That is seen to improve the standard of living you know.

109
00:13:33,21 --> 00:13:47,4
The idea of stand of living it's quite nonsensical. Oh i think my quality of life is probably very high.

110
00:13:48,4 --> 00:13:54,45
I mean i don't know. Nobody is going around sort of. Comparing people's quality of life that i know of.

111
00:13:54,45 --> 00:13:58,09
But although there is a lot of study being done on standard of living

112
00:13:58,09 --> 00:14:03,57
and standards of living a based entirely on the profit and turnover norm that's still the stuff that doesn't.

113
00:14:03,57 --> 00:14:11,17
You know people can be totally miserable. Caught up in the rat race doing a job they don't like. And yet.

114
00:14:11,17 --> 00:14:17,66
Their standard of living can be seen to be very high you know but but their quality of life is just down the drain.

115
00:14:17,66 --> 00:14:25,67
And the way that. We are here i think that we're all. As i was saying before we don't do any very much.

116
00:14:25,67 --> 00:14:36,00
But we're living in a rural environment. We've got clean air fresh water and this. Beautiful views.

117
00:14:37,36 --> 00:14:42,86
We can do what we won't we are all free individuals we're not working on the buses.

118
00:14:44,72 --> 00:14:50,8
We're getting basically what we need. And i think that makes a quality of life very high. You know.

119
00:14:50,8 --> 00:15:04,04
Even though there's somebody might say i stand of living is not so high. Yeah.

120
00:15:04,04 --> 00:15:11,87
As you can see we've got there are lines only fifty meters away. But we decided. When we built this place that.

121
00:15:11,87 --> 00:15:21,14
This is the rain that new rain that their company premises that we were not going to connect to the grid.

122
00:15:21,14 --> 00:15:30,06
And we were going to provide all their own pay for it and. Down by way of. Bet fifty solar panels on the roof.

123
00:15:30,06 --> 00:15:42,9
And their winter at the back and a standby generator if neither of those work or. This building is also. Incorporating.

124
00:15:42,9 --> 00:15:52,59
Passive solar design. We've got most of the glass. Facing north. Being in the seventy m. C. Of the. Sense joins in.

125
00:15:52,59 --> 00:15:58,71
You know this is from the north. We've got eaves over or these windows.

126
00:15:58,71 --> 00:16:06,07
Calculated to let the sun shine in over the winter months. But to keep the sending out over the summer months.

127
00:16:06,07 --> 00:16:17,28
This building is a severe story ended. So that you know we've got a lot of thermal mass in the building.

128
00:16:17,28 --> 00:16:23,01
We've got six hundred tons of mud brick in the building i think and concrete floors.

129
00:16:23,41 --> 00:16:29,93
So that when the scent penetrates into the building over the winter months. All that thermal mess heats up and.

130
00:16:29,93 --> 00:16:35,72
Maintains its heat for a long period of time so the building tends to retain its heat over the winter months.

131
00:16:35,72 --> 00:16:42,67
Over the summer months as sam doesn't shine in so all this there were mistakes relatively cool and.

132
00:16:42,67 --> 00:16:45,4
Keeps a fairly constant cool temperature over the summer months.

133
00:16:46,56 --> 00:16:55,27
We've also got a fairly high roof in the building which allows us to use lies to some extent. We call it.

134
00:16:55,27 --> 00:17:00,14
The chimney effect. You know thermal updrafts.

135
00:17:00,14 --> 00:17:06,25
So that it's possible to open up areas of the building where the cool air can be allowed in.

136
00:17:06,25 --> 00:17:14,43
And as the air heats up it moves out through through the vents in the roof. Those vents in the roof can be closed off.

137
00:17:14,43 --> 00:17:20,88
So that. In the winter months you can maintain the heat within the beginning of the summer months you can just.

138
00:17:20,88 --> 00:17:32,48
They are the airflow to keep building cool. We've got they think you've seen the courtyard.

139
00:17:32,93 --> 00:17:37,27
We've got a courtyard within the building totally surrounded by the building which is got no roof.

140
00:17:37,27 --> 00:17:39,82
So it's an open area but within the building.

141
00:17:39,82 --> 00:17:44,32
And that helps to let more light into the building because of the size of the building.

142
00:17:44,32 --> 00:18:05,82
And also a way i was to ventilate the building. More adequately.

143
00:18:05,82 --> 00:18:17,84
Nimbleness as the alternative keppel of the strayer i think niman is a very unique place and.

144
00:18:17,84 --> 00:18:24,05
Nimitz uniqueness is lend itself to sitting up with the rain but there are company here.

145
00:18:25,06 --> 00:18:29,29
A lot more successfully than we could have done anywhere else in the country.

146
00:18:29,29 --> 00:18:36,6
Nimbin is famous for being famous so to speak. You know. We keep getting media.

147
00:18:36,6 --> 00:18:40,1
Being attracted here all the time and most of the time.

148
00:18:40,1 --> 00:18:45,61
They've so the forgotten why they're coming here but i just don't keep coming here.

149
00:18:46,75 --> 00:18:53,07
And i think that that has helped us to a great extent. You know.

150
00:18:53,07 --> 00:19:03,38
We've got in this area we have a lot of really committed people. People with great environmental awareness and.

151
00:19:03,38 --> 00:19:07,00
People who are really keen on the trying out new experiments.

152
00:19:07,87 --> 00:19:14,97
I think that looking for people with those qualities yasir in the country would be a lot had and in and in the area.

153
00:19:16,1 --> 00:19:25,24
We've got every. Would you call it. Skill you could possibly think of.

154
00:19:26,64 --> 00:19:32,39
Within a twenty mile radius of newman you know so you can think of.

155
00:19:32,39 --> 00:19:36,03
You probably don't have to go very far to find it you know i know of people around here that.

156
00:19:36,03 --> 00:19:43,11
Were a nuclear physicist etc you know. I just didn't want to be padded anymore so i decided to come to an inventor.

157
00:19:43,11 --> 00:20:03,07
So i think that. Nimbin. Does attract the kind of people that helps to make their aim at their company work. Yeah.

158
00:20:03,07 --> 00:20:09,71
Yeah there is definitely. Year. Your name and again. Name is very unusual in many respects.

159
00:20:10,51 --> 00:20:18,61
Even though they're let's say we're in a site here that's not all that good for insulation for solitaire.

160
00:20:19,53 --> 00:20:27,12
Yet nimbin is probably at of all the residents nimbin more than fifty percent of them are living on their own

161
00:20:27,12 --> 00:20:32,49
standalone power systems. And most of those are living on the. Entirely solar power systems.

162
00:20:32,49 --> 00:20:43,26
So there's a very strong awareness. In this area of environmental issues in a lot of people that. Move here.

163
00:20:43,26 --> 00:20:45,68
Do not want to know that they're.

164
00:20:49,5 --> 00:20:51,11
Also people who do not want to know

165
00:20:51,11 --> 00:20:58,24
or they are a bad standard to carry a serious systems in all sorts of stuff we've had a great dispute in in business

166
00:20:58,24 --> 00:21:07,75
recently over the name and sewerage game. You know a lot of the townsfolk wanted it. Very much. I think.

167
00:21:07,75 --> 00:21:09,73
Through ignorance. You know.

168
00:21:09,73 --> 00:21:15,62
Because it's a funny thing the sirius system because it's only been around for a hundred years you know there were the

169
00:21:15,62 --> 00:21:16,72
karyotype sewerage system but.

170
00:21:16,72 --> 00:21:17,75
Yet this day

171
00:21:17,75 --> 00:21:25,24
and age it's taken for granted you know if you want a serious system with a carry siri system is the only way to go.

172
00:21:25,73 --> 00:21:32,14
And unfortunately the strategy has been very few. Down set up within you know anything else. So there's no other.

173
00:21:32,14 --> 00:21:40,75
Example for people to turn to. So when. There was a lot of talk in him in the bed. Having a sewage system here.

174
00:21:42,34 --> 00:21:54,31
So many people said oh yeah ok. We'll carry sewage system. Because that's what everybody immediately thinks of.

175
00:21:54,31 --> 00:22:02,18
What a lot of the the. People do not live in the township. They live in the surrounding areas.

176
00:22:02,18 --> 00:22:09,6
And most of these people do not like to see the war they carry a serious system. You know and particularly.

177
00:22:09,6 --> 00:22:17,11
Now we've been hearing so much lately. They are blue green algae pollution of. River systems and.

178
00:22:17,11 --> 00:22:20,94
Ocean pollution through ocean outfalls and that's the stuff.

179
00:22:20,94 --> 00:22:28,9
And also you have a strategy it's generally a very dry continent. And just same scrape.

180
00:22:28,9 --> 00:22:36,83
Added our top quality that we should be flushing thirty five to fifty percent of it down the downy. You know.

181
00:22:36,83 --> 00:22:42,28
We hear the rain but our company we decided to go for a dry composting toilet.

182
00:22:42,28 --> 00:22:50,25
You know so you're not you not flushing the down your door there's no water involved in the process. We also.

183
00:22:50,25 --> 00:22:55,22
Self-sufficient with water here. Or the water requirements for the rain that their company collected off the roof here.

184
00:22:55,67 --> 00:23:06,55
We don't do not connect to the nimbin. The supply system being you a going back to what i was talking about.

185
00:23:06,55 --> 00:23:13,38
With with the sirius system in him and. I think that there were other options there.

186
00:23:13,38 --> 00:23:16,43
Particularly one option that would have been very very much cheaper.

187
00:23:16,43 --> 00:23:25,24
To this sewage game that's now going in the game is costing about three million dollars. We could have put in.

188
00:23:25,49 --> 00:23:31,66
Drug companies. Posting to of this nature. For a fraction of that cost.

189
00:23:31,66 --> 00:23:42,27
And then of course no further bills or anything down the line other than just. Just a small collection fee.

190
00:23:42,27 --> 00:23:43,87
You know i think that every six months

191
00:23:43,87 --> 00:23:47,55
or possibly an employee of their aimed at their company even could have just gone around

192
00:23:47,55 --> 00:23:55,41
and emptied the filled containers. You know the thing about dry composting toilet is what comes out of him.

193
00:23:55,41 --> 00:24:04,98
Is not in any way unpleasant. It's what comes out of his actually very rich. Soft soil.

194
00:24:04,98 --> 00:24:11,71
You know humus it's a very dry crumbly soft soil it's. It's actually.

195
00:24:11,71 --> 00:24:21,53
It's no different to the best saw that you find in the garden and you're you know if you wait.

196
00:24:21,53 --> 00:24:27,06
If you've got a dry composition toil and it's hard to decay for at least nine months then.

197
00:24:27,06 --> 00:24:30,22
Then what you've got to deal with there is actually a very valuable commodity.

198
00:24:30,9 --> 00:24:36,28
It's actually a saleable commodity whereas what we're doing now.

199
00:24:36,28 --> 00:24:43,57
I'm not sure where they were they thinking about trying to sell. The byproduct.

200
00:24:43,57 --> 00:24:48,95
But the problem with with their standard oil carry serious systems is that the byproduct.

201
00:24:48,95 --> 00:24:56,53
Is still likely to be contaminated with with all sorts of human pathogens. Whereas with a dry composting toilet.

202
00:24:56,53 --> 00:25:00,98
Every human pathogen. Other than possibly around will make has been destroyed in the process.

203
00:25:01,87 --> 00:25:11,23
So there's nothing that compares with with with dry composting for getting rid of pathogens.

204
00:25:11,23 --> 00:25:43,43
If you must get frustrated. Things like well. Well if you ask around him been there as a success story.

205
00:25:43,43 --> 00:25:49,97
I think everybody will point to the name that their company first thing you know. I think that.

206
00:25:49,97 --> 00:25:52,93
There are things happening. Around nimbin.

207
00:25:52,93 --> 00:25:59,39
That everybody is proud of the way that i feel about things i thought i've had this feeling for a long long time i

208
00:25:59,39 --> 00:26:03,16
remember when i was a teenager in my twenty's

209
00:26:03,16 --> 00:26:09,95
and seeing all these demonstrations around the place you know vietnam demonstrations all this is stuff.

210
00:26:09,95 --> 00:26:20,44
And all these demonstrations to me. Seem to be wrong. They seem to be throwing aggression. At violence. You know.

211
00:26:20,44 --> 00:26:28,44
Throwing more violence in the direction of violence. To me if you wanted to demonstrate something.

212
00:26:28,44 --> 00:26:34,54
What you ought to be demonstrating is how to do it. Not him not to do it. You know.

213
00:26:34,54 --> 00:26:36,71
I guess that's what my life has been all about.

214
00:26:36,71 --> 00:26:39,69
You know i've always wanted to demonstrate the positive and not the negative.

215
00:26:40,28 --> 00:26:48,47
So they're aimed at their company is an example of that. I think that with through here trying to demonstrate.

216
00:26:48,47 --> 00:26:56,72
Not necessarily what's wrong with their with where the us is doing it. But they have to do it correctly and.

217
00:26:56,72 --> 00:27:04,36
I think that. You know. Nimbin. Got all sorts of. Positive and negative aspects to it.

218
00:27:04,36 --> 00:27:12,72
But i'd like to focus more on the positive and not take so much notice of the negative. Hence our address year.

219
00:27:12,72 --> 00:27:25,51
One alternative way. We had a straight here that never name to it so decide to give their own name. And that's are ok.
