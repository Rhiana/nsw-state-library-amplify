1
00:00:12,98 --> 00:00:20,96
Arrived being gay and be here in bill includes a supposed. Part of the reason for me coming here would food.

2
00:00:20,96 --> 00:00:23,97
Probably be my sexuality. In there.

3
00:00:23,97 --> 00:00:32,58
At the time living in queensland in his truck sure which still had these accepted homosexuality. It was restrictive.

4
00:00:32,58 --> 00:00:43,98
I guess i felt that. I couldn't see why that should be any why i had to go through all that bullshit. Then coming here.

5
00:00:43,98 --> 00:00:53,37
And still i suppose in this sort of that you do have to be careful that sense of you know survival thing only.

6
00:00:53,37 --> 00:01:00,41
You know if you care if you taste of what around. Before you jump in but then thinking oh fuck you know.

7
00:01:00,41 --> 00:01:04,19
These are all people who have finding out that. You know they died who is.

8
00:01:04,19 --> 00:01:10,29
You know that i should tell you we're all so different in each individual elegy and and.

9
00:01:10,29 --> 00:01:14,02
You look at other people you see. You know. He's taking a selfie. Are you.

10
00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:18,38
That person is really preside of that for this is really.

11
00:01:18,38 --> 00:01:27,54
So weird eccentric and if he can hit us away they are the law. Why can't i just bring the myself there.

12
00:01:27,54 --> 00:01:36,07
And bring that i speak to me. And so then sort of i suppose where you know. You can.

13
00:01:36,07 --> 00:01:42,02
You can go overboard in these things you can sort of. You know sort of guys i will and i'm a guy.

14
00:01:42,02 --> 00:01:49,39
And all of a poster you know and that's it except there are.

15
00:01:49,39 --> 00:01:55,55
No without having to do that but it is interacting with people and then finding that. You know.

16
00:01:55,55 --> 00:02:02,12
People find out what you're all about that either they accept it or they done it if they did all this. You know.

17
00:02:02,12 --> 00:02:08,97
That's a problem and. They're not worse now i the. Finding actually finding. In the ten years of.

18
00:02:09,11 --> 00:02:18,57
Being here i've never had anyone put me down for my sexuality. To my face. That is.

19
00:02:18,57 --> 00:02:24,6
I suppose over all the people to see. Except me for the way. Down for other things.

20
00:02:24,6 --> 00:02:37,27
Being the treasure of trying to create your own body during their money. You fuckwit. Not for my sexuality.

21
00:02:38,72 --> 00:02:47,02
If anything. Quite the opposite that some people really like to key into the. That they like that.

22
00:02:47,02 --> 00:02:52,74
And they like you for your other aspects you know. The. I think people basically like people.

23
00:02:52,74 --> 00:03:00,65
If if if they feel comfortable with you you know if they. They feel you're ok.

24
00:03:00,65 --> 00:03:08,41
And you know they are who don't want to do anything you know sort of. Bad against a motive. Also that.

25
00:03:08,41 --> 00:03:12,06
You know i think people key into your energies if you.

26
00:03:12,06 --> 00:03:20,69
If you sort of stabling itself if you can change within yourself that. That shows that they can.

27
00:03:20,69 --> 00:03:26,94
And i think part of that stability. Is being honest with the self. Just expressing yourself issue.

28
00:03:26,94 --> 00:03:35,1
So that you know what enhances the other. And that overrides all those of the negative aspects.

29
00:03:35,1 --> 00:03:39,78
And yeah it's funny that people just accept that. I do find it.

30
00:03:41,2 --> 00:03:47,96
Especially when with the guys around here the mouse that there are there is sort of probably tolerance.

31
00:03:47,96 --> 00:03:56,02
In some people rather than acceptance of. What it would have or might be that the interact you know. Sure you know.

32
00:03:56,02 --> 00:04:00,76
You do things but. There is a limitation as to how close you can get to.

33
00:04:03,28 --> 00:04:12,61
But there are a lot of guys around who are john mind getting closer to him and doesn't want. Him. Which is great.

34
00:04:12,61 --> 00:04:21,25
I was just talking about guys because you know. They being mile and. I think my liberation has yet to cow.

35
00:04:21,25 --> 00:04:43,07
Because it is well overdue. They really need. Even here in the old to a dish. And actually being gay here.

36
00:04:43,98 --> 00:04:49,59
It's not been a problem. The only thing lately on fining is probably now because.

37
00:04:49,59 --> 00:05:00,23
I possibly feel a need to get back into a relationship. And for that to happen when you're in a village that. You know.

38
00:05:00,23 --> 00:05:05,94
Still at present has very minimal contact with the outside world.

39
00:05:05,94 --> 00:05:09,01
So it's a difficult thing to do i think it's the sort of place that.

40
00:05:09,01 --> 00:05:12,89
If you want to settle down or with a relationship or in a relationship here.

41
00:05:12,89 --> 00:05:20,77
That you need to find a relationship think come here. Rather than finding it here.

42
00:05:22,38 --> 00:05:27,54
Since expressing that to a lot of people i found that people say although you know i i've got a brother who's got a

43
00:05:27,54 --> 00:05:41,8
well my son is gay and stuff like that that. Maybe that's not the case. Yes. But anyway. I mean.

44
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:50,73
I just i don't think it may have i think at the time.

45
00:05:51,77 --> 00:05:58,12
A number of us here were going through a sort of change period and. Maybe even though it's.

46
00:05:58,12 --> 00:06:02,23
This is a very beautiful place to live in i mean it's fantastic again.

47
00:06:02,23 --> 00:06:05,57
If you've ever been around the world over to parts of the world.

48
00:06:05,57 --> 00:06:12,31
To other countries you know has to realize that we live in utopia. Here is free in place.

49
00:06:12,31 --> 00:06:22,21
But also i think the realization that. One shoelace or in something for a period of time you take it for granted.

50
00:06:22,21 --> 00:06:24,09
And even though you're not environment.

51
00:06:24,09 --> 00:06:29,42
That's brilliant after a while you take it for granted and you possibly need to change your knees.

52
00:06:30,08 --> 00:06:35,18
But that positive negative thing. You know you. You can't always know.

53
00:06:35,18 --> 00:06:41,82
Being happy is unless you experience the opposite. And so you need a change you need to get away. And then.

54
00:06:41,82 --> 00:06:50,59
Sometimes you need an overpowered with politics. Life and politics in everything. Should have way forever.

55
00:06:53,69 --> 00:07:02,49
And that can make you unhappy say things. I don't want to use only this anymore i want to get out of here.

56
00:07:02,64 --> 00:07:11,41
So i want to do something else i need to break away i need to kid. Different stimulation. And then through.

57
00:07:11,99 --> 00:07:21,15
I don't know if there is can stances i think. I actually think we create it even if we don't realize it. Doing a radio.

58
00:07:21,15 --> 00:07:33,25
A course in radio programming and from. The. I got involved.

59
00:07:33,25 --> 00:07:36,61
After that stage was sort of a united sort of a bit of a change going on

60
00:07:36,61 --> 00:07:44,44
and i started i got involved with doing a cool rodeo programming and that was through tafe and list.

61
00:07:44,44 --> 00:07:52,54
And part of that was actually doing. Experience at the un and see. If in the community radio.

62
00:07:53,04 --> 00:08:02,79
Which was then at the college. The northern rivers college at that particular time. And you're ensuring that cause.

63
00:08:02,79 --> 00:08:08,97
We're talking with the program manager. At the station and. She asked me what sort of program. I was looking at doing.

64
00:08:10,41 --> 00:08:16,6
And at the time i thought well. Suppose if i want to do a program be something to do with.

65
00:08:16,6 --> 00:08:24,68
Some something a bit radical gay people or something like that i get a program. And then sometime after that.

66
00:08:24,68 --> 00:08:26,79
She then approach me about.

67
00:08:26,79 --> 00:08:33,56
Actually doing the program there was a gay program called guy ways a gay and lesbian program i should say.

68
00:08:35,66 --> 00:08:46,53
Colgate waste. And she asked me if i get involved with that program and. I thought about it and i thought oh yeah ok.

69
00:08:46,53 --> 00:08:51,6
And sort of circumstance that the times. Create a tad too i suppose.

70
00:08:52,33 --> 00:08:57,56
Sort of coming back receive me and getting stuck and lose more because we had a flood on a particular time

71
00:08:57,56 --> 00:09:00,76
and staying at the radio station to help them.

72
00:09:00,76 --> 00:09:07,28
Because they had to move to equipment and thing finding i was doing it on a programming for the first time.

73
00:09:07,28 --> 00:09:15,52
And then when i started getting involved with the actual gay ways program. And at that particular time.

74
00:09:16,38 --> 00:09:25,62
Sort of finding that it really need to be straight restructured. To create a bit of progress. On the sexual people and.

75
00:09:25,62 --> 00:09:34,47
Approaching a friend and asking her if she would get involved. And she agreed and. Through that. Enfoldment and.

76
00:09:35,41 --> 00:09:38,8
She was actually the one that expressed that she liked to have.

77
00:09:38,8 --> 00:09:46,41
Dances around the area because there really wasn't anybody with that kind of sexual people who go to to meet.

78
00:09:46,41 --> 00:09:55,00
And so i korea and then the realisation that we needed a group of people to set the dance out. So i think the i do you.

79
00:09:55,00 --> 00:10:02,33
Will we need a gay group. And even though there had been various groups and.

80
00:10:02,33 --> 00:10:11,87
Such a kelly guy and i think along was the north america's gay group. And. The other was sunland. Some. Career.

81
00:10:11,87 --> 00:10:20,9
But they really didn't last long and sort of died down. So they went about trying to to form a group.

82
00:10:21,38 --> 00:10:28,4
It was a lot of work for a lot of running around. A lot of structuring that. Very positive stuff. Getting.

83
00:10:28,4 --> 00:10:39,05
I was finding actually i was getting back a lot of very positive feedback and. Coding treat me. Because also.

84
00:10:39,8 --> 00:10:48,66
Some people had expressed that wouldn't happen that there's too much to be around still and especially in these more.

85
00:10:48,66 --> 00:10:55,44
Particular newspaper in these small. At that particular time was very anti gay because their article.

86
00:10:56,37 --> 00:10:58,85
But not really key into that

87
00:10:58,85 --> 00:11:07,42
and i couldn't really see that i suppose because being ability would tend to be somewhat isolated from the system.

88
00:11:07,42 --> 00:11:08,25
And you can get.

89
00:11:08,25 --> 00:11:12,26
So locked up in the place where you're living that you know every now

90
00:11:12,26 --> 00:11:18,67
and then you realize oh well there's a system out there it is. There's a whole new world out there. So not really.

91
00:11:19,16 --> 00:11:24,6
I suppose being keyed into what was happening in the area. And i think that was probably a good thing.

92
00:11:25,13 --> 00:11:32,62
So we went ahead and. The first dance we had actually the majority of people that helped this.

93
00:11:32,62 --> 00:11:39,8
Set up the dance who had her sexual. Friends. It was intriguing and. The dance was a success.

94
00:11:39,8 --> 00:11:45,48
We had about one hundred twenty hundred thirty paying people going in and then it started from there.

95
00:11:49,29 --> 00:12:06,86
Jesus would have been. Three and probably four yeas ago now. Before we. Did the group well at the time. I think it was.

96
00:12:06,86 --> 00:12:08,97
We used the name. Some of the.

97
00:12:09,17 --> 00:12:20,23
Gay krupa then it was until about a third or fourth meeting that we decided on a name which was the tropical fruits.

98
00:12:20,23 --> 00:12:32,06
And. Even for the first i think probably. Seven i know i need ngs we had. There's any handful of those at the meeting.

99
00:12:32,06 --> 00:12:40,41
And the second. We put on we had problems. Were actually experience i think what was a bit of hunger phobia.

100
00:12:40,41 --> 00:12:45,77
Were told at particular the whole will using the last minute we couldn't use because.

101
00:12:45,77 --> 00:12:52,91
The line was going to end and it was then a day before the dance was on. So we had to.

102
00:12:52,91 --> 00:13:03,26
Five find another hole quickly which we did quite fortunately. Didn't find people to sit up to redirect.

103
00:13:03,26 --> 00:13:10,94
People to the new hole. And in spite of all that. That was a second day we had it went off really well.

104
00:13:10,94 --> 00:13:20,38
Was a great day. And. Then i think we had a bit of a lull in the group at that particular time. And.

105
00:13:20,38 --> 00:13:25,99
Farnie by there in that i was doing the gay ways program.

106
00:13:26,2 --> 00:13:31,01
And then we had this group and when you started putting out a newsletter as well.

107
00:13:31,01 --> 00:13:36,19
So joining cordel caught a lot of different things and.

108
00:13:38,15 --> 00:13:45,72
Also at that particular time i got involved a relationship that. Turned out to be quite possess.

109
00:13:46,55 --> 00:13:53,64
I think that was taking my time than anything else. And so i tend to let it go the group a bit.

110
00:13:53,64 --> 00:13:57,41
But unfortunately there were other people there to take over to get involved and that's

111
00:13:57,41 --> 00:14:01,3
when i think it really started taking oath.

112
00:14:01,3 --> 00:14:08,97
Which i suppose shows me that i think you can take a thing so far and then you could let it go and if if it's.

113
00:14:09,4 --> 00:14:21,46
It's meant to happen it'll go. And if it doesn't. There was virtually none.

114
00:14:21,46 --> 00:14:31,41
At that particular time then and only for the gateways program. That was going. And then used to wonder as to.

115
00:14:31,41 --> 00:14:34,83
You know who was if there was in your listening to the program because it was fairly late

116
00:14:34,83 --> 00:14:47,1
and i saw a lot of people be restricted. As to listening to to the program. Because that the the times law.

117
00:14:47,1 --> 00:14:53,38
And there were. We had problems that used to be an earlier time slot pickle moot and we couldn't get it changed bank.

118
00:14:53,38 --> 00:14:58,83
And we wondered with a part of that monitoring for fear hunger phobia again.

119
00:14:58,83 --> 00:15:05,96
But apart from that there was there was no other known network there is an overall net gain network cool. I think.

120
00:15:06,85 --> 00:15:15,52
Country network. That covers the whole of australia. I think there were quite a few people gay people or sexual people.

121
00:15:15,52 --> 00:15:24,67
From this area who were members of that network. But apart from that there was nothing else here.

122
00:15:24,67 --> 00:15:32,51
And there with the group. Police. We had a magazine which was called fruit juice and.

123
00:15:33,27 --> 00:15:37,9
We try and they were used to print out every month.

124
00:15:38,27 --> 00:15:44,14
And then we started linking out with with other groups from other areas and.

125
00:15:44,14 --> 00:15:52,98
Through the gay media and the gay priests were ever ties and yes. Yes. And of course. Now.

126
00:15:52,98 --> 00:15:58,51
I think we're we have a reputation for that particular to get a crew to tropical fruits.

127
00:15:58,51 --> 00:16:08,97
Has a reputation of being the nice day. Country. Network. And the.

128
00:16:09,29 --> 00:16:17,57
Dances well i suppose you could anything up to three hundred people. At a dance which is quite a lot. The reputations.

129
00:16:17,57 --> 00:16:28,38
That dance this is a very crude. Exit. Just getting back to the to the network around the area.

130
00:16:28,65 --> 00:16:36,19
A lot of things seem to happen at the same time with doing the right. Program in the group and then used later and.

131
00:16:36,19 --> 00:16:52,56
And the dances and that. Also got involved with looking at setting out. The network for people for hiv positive people.

132
00:16:52,56 --> 00:16:58,22
That there were a group of people and lose all. They were interested in having meetings and.

133
00:16:58,22 --> 00:17:09,15
At that particular time having meetings at some vincent's hospital. To set up a. I don't know. So i wish for a.

134
00:17:10,83 --> 00:17:21,27
Support crew here for people who had tried for a speaker. And i sort of. Was involved with that food.

135
00:17:21,27 --> 00:17:27,72
To a minimal degree mainly because of my link with with the group as a social group. And the radio program.

136
00:17:28,55 --> 00:17:34,53
What actually happened. Was a call and was approached in sydney and.

137
00:17:34,53 --> 00:17:41,8
They had a person come up to look at setting up a branch up here. And that's what eventually happens. Then we had.

138
00:17:41,8 --> 00:17:50,55
The a comprehension you sell. An old and rivers here you know the district. I'm not exactly sure now on the.

139
00:17:50,55 --> 00:18:02,53
Days but probably that would have been. Maybe just go to three. And to. Fairly well established.

140
00:18:03,62 --> 00:18:08,97
I think they do a lot of good work around here is also there was the needle exchange program. But that was actually.

141
00:18:09,09 --> 00:18:18,73
Set up by the health department i think before a con. And then.

142
00:18:18,73 --> 00:18:29,22
I think a con also has sort of given a lot of help sort of set up a networking system as well and sort of.

143
00:18:29,22 --> 00:18:34,39
Supported by. The the. Tropical fruits and. Even those that.

144
00:18:34,39 --> 00:18:41,03
The tropical fruit is actually just a social group i'm right from the beginning it was expressed that it should just be

145
00:18:41,03 --> 00:18:48,55
purely for enjoyment and in taman it shouldn't be political. Anyway though it's always harder to breathe.

146
00:18:48,55 --> 00:18:55,23
Color ticks into anything. There were there was or used to have a we have. Dances actually.

147
00:18:55,23 --> 00:19:01,62
A lot of the dances recruit paintings create cool. And then there is for a lot of.

148
00:19:01,62 --> 00:19:05,84
We had no problems with that until they had a change in the whole committee.

149
00:19:05,84 --> 00:19:12,14
And then you committee decided it then it would have put just having dances say that.

150
00:19:13,23 --> 00:19:22,52
That letter ended up in a consultation a lot of the meetings and forgotten.

151
00:19:22,52 --> 00:19:28,02
I'm pretty sure in the setting up of the gay group and.

152
00:19:28,02 --> 00:19:37,27
The social group and the radio program and the news let the magazine. We also were approached by.

153
00:19:37,27 --> 00:19:46,61
I think it was fred miller at the time who was. Who's involved with the police and gailey his group. And.

154
00:19:46,61 --> 00:19:52,6
So he came up from sydney and we had meetings with him and one of the local pubs in lewis well.

155
00:19:52,6 --> 00:20:10,92
And also the local community police officer and. I said let's. It way we. We had meetings in.

156
00:20:10,92 --> 00:20:27,85
One of the social venues in lismore. And. Formed also formed the police and a liaison group for this area. And.

157
00:20:27,85 --> 00:20:37,3
Also at the time. There's some people who who felt that we should have. Radical gay groups write. Gay activists and.

158
00:20:37,3 --> 00:20:45,1
Maybe a branch of act up. Should be represented here. And i sort of got involved with that also.

159
00:20:45,1 --> 00:20:51,35
And so we had to make sure that we that we didn't think involved the social group with that. And they were.

160
00:20:51,35 --> 00:20:58,33
There was a time when. Fred nile. Came up. And we. We had a bit of a demonstration at proms with cade's.

161
00:20:58,33 --> 00:21:09,4
Which was televised. So it's quite interesting. What was more interesting was the reaction from people.

162
00:21:09,4 --> 00:21:15,34
I walking down the street people would come up to me that i'd never seen before and say ah so you're on t.v.

163
00:21:15,34 --> 00:21:17,48
and I think.

164
00:21:17,48 --> 00:21:21,9
They say ah it's great i think it's good i like what you're doing i'm really support you

165
00:21:21,9 --> 00:21:31,8
and stuff like that so it's very positive stuff. I was going to. I was a bit of a blower. But that was happening. Was.

166
00:21:35,85 --> 00:21:42,98
Yes there is. And there is so in lismore too apparently i was unaware of it until fairly.

167
00:21:42,98 --> 00:21:46,3
Until after i actually got involved with with helping set up.

168
00:21:46,3 --> 00:21:58,39
The gay groups a social a group that i discovered there was. But. Apart from allowed to help.

169
00:21:58,66 --> 00:22:05,75
Are there were little things like in. I think in some of the local papers like the northern star in the air.

170
00:22:05,75 --> 00:22:08,97
There were articles by people who felt that.

171
00:22:09,01 --> 00:22:13,92
You know having radical pushed his running around the hills is not a good thing.

172
00:22:13,92 --> 00:22:18,36
And that they found that they didn't like it.

173
00:22:18,36 --> 00:22:24,65
And it caused this something like that would happen with a little who'd always be a few of us are gradually cause him.

174
00:22:24,65 --> 00:22:31,58
And replied to that and. Explain that you know pre-human we're people too and.

175
00:22:31,58 --> 00:22:40,23
You know we just want to be ourselves that we're not really hurting anyone. And why should it worries a lot richer.

176
00:22:55,8 --> 00:23:02,95
And i do have a few present a funny story about.
