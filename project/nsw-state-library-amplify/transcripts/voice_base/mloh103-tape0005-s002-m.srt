1
00:00:12,38 --> 00:00:23,64
Yeah. I think that. The community certainly didn't seem a as any sort of guru or.

2
00:00:23,64 --> 00:00:34,51
As any sort of highly qualified or addict. Counselor. People didn't come to me for counseling and i didn't treat me in.

3
00:00:34,51 --> 00:00:42,8
In public theater's as if i had anything particular to offer. The various debates because of.

4
00:00:42,8 --> 00:00:54,9
I was working in lease more as a psychiatrist and i was therefore very much a part of the dominant paradigm. So i was.

5
00:00:54,9 --> 00:01:02,2
That part of me that aspect to me being a psychiatrist i. I think i just rejected. That.

6
00:01:02,2 --> 00:01:06,74
Fortunately i had an alter ego i was amused.

7
00:01:07,28 --> 00:01:18,66
And i think an awful lot of people really to rely to me as a talented musician i was only working part time

8
00:01:18,66 --> 00:01:24,95
and so i was i will do a lot of music and. Teach at the local community school and do all of those sorts of things.

9
00:01:26,4 --> 00:01:33,7
My identity as a psychiatrist wasn't important. Except as i said with the policeman to some extent.

10
00:01:33,7 --> 00:01:42,79
And my be with the townsfolk a guy gave me a bit of an on try to to move. And talk with people.

11
00:01:42,79 --> 00:01:47,35
Perhaps more frequently than other people did but certainly as far as the tribe was concerned.

12
00:01:47,35 --> 00:01:53,02
That wasn't what i wanted to know about me even know a lot of questions i even.

13
00:01:53,79 --> 00:01:59,84
I guess one of the reasons that i was able to survive it all was that i had a reputation for being an anti psychiatrist.

14
00:02:00,26 --> 00:02:11,79
Well that khomeini's bizarre in the extreme. Anti psychiatry. Was that. Interesting. Deviation. That.

15
00:02:13,00 --> 00:02:28,64
Occurred in the light sixty's. With. Ron lange the. The british psychiatrist who discovered existentialism which.

16
00:02:28,64 --> 00:02:32,9
Most psychiatrists in the fifty's and sixty's.

17
00:02:32,9 --> 00:02:40,62
And before that of course knew nothing about but he was ice psychiatrist who read existentialism and.

18
00:02:42,33 --> 00:02:45,00
There were a number of. Who did but he.

19
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:53,14
Importantly then decided of course that somebody who was paranoid and who was rejecting.

20
00:02:53,14 --> 00:02:58,08
You know the dominant paradigm. Through their paranoia.

21
00:02:58,08 --> 00:03:05,46
Was probably more in contact with reality than the people who didn't. A very romantic and sentimental notion.

22
00:03:05,46 --> 00:03:16,72
With which i was absolutely captivated. As a young psychiatrist. You know when various. People with.

23
00:03:16,72 --> 00:03:26,76
Terrible mental illness. Even when i was a try in a. Expounded on. The theories that.

24
00:03:26,76 --> 00:03:39,02
You know that i was likely to be ona lighted by various forces in the society and. Their predatory and capitalist.

25
00:03:39,02 --> 00:03:47,36
Parents. I mean i was only too willing to hear this and to hear it as a valid.

26
00:03:47,36 --> 00:03:55,05
Interpretation of reality and to therefore see them. Being dealt with as if i was sick.

27
00:03:55,05 --> 00:04:02,37
An invalid died and having those experiences invalidated. As. Definitely part of the problems. That was.

28
00:04:02,37 --> 00:04:08,91
I was quite comfortable with the libel of being an anti psychiatrist even though.

29
00:04:08,91 --> 00:04:19,19
I worked with people who were seriously. Italy ill and. Use drugs and treated them in fairly conventional wise.

30
00:04:19,65 --> 00:04:25,19
That's not to say that i didn't try the other one in the research project i referred to earlier was one where i really

31
00:04:25,19 --> 00:04:37,87
was trying very hard to deal with mad people as if i were totally responsible human beings as if i were.

32
00:04:37,87 --> 00:04:49,08
Creating the sorts of delimiters that i got into as authentic. Poor trials of. Of their political and personal reality.

33
00:04:50,37 --> 00:05:02,06
But of course. It just didn't help them. All if it didn't help them suddenly.

34
00:05:02,06 --> 00:05:12,54
Validating the paranoid and delusional experiences of people who have some sort of mental disorders. Is useful.

35
00:05:12,54 --> 00:05:19,76
I'm sure it provides them with some comfort. But actually on its own and.

36
00:05:19,76 --> 00:05:26,31
It's really not going to stop them from probably perishing. Or killing somebody else.

37
00:05:26,31 --> 00:05:35,07
And you know i am a doctor and other people are doctors or psychiatrists because for some reason we. We decided that.

38
00:05:35,07 --> 00:05:44,23
It's probably a mark of a human community if i die and let those people die or or carry other people or why with them.

39
00:05:44,23 --> 00:05:49,82
Because of this trying to beliefs. But anyhow i think the fact that i was now known as an anti psychiatrist.

40
00:05:49,82 --> 00:05:59,35
And that i'd suffered. Not even considerably from my peers. You know i filed me in my exams the first time.

41
00:05:59,35 --> 00:06:07,64
But i mean i turned up at this. You know. Formidable and. Important final exam in psychiatry with.

42
00:06:07,64 --> 00:06:11,79
You know i head down to my wife's in a duffel.

43
00:06:13,33 --> 00:06:18,97
Probably be in things i mean the next time i sat for the exam which you're allowed to do every six months i wore a

44
00:06:18,97 --> 00:06:27,82
three piece suit and. Had a whisky first and had my hair cut and past the exam. But i mean the fact that i was an n.t.

45
00:06:27,82 --> 00:06:32,3
Psychiatrist and a high profile one in the media in the early seventy's.

46
00:06:32,3 --> 00:07:00,67
Probably also help me to be quite accepted by the tribe. Up there. Well i yes i think that.

47
00:07:00,67 --> 00:07:07,47
It's very hard to know of course whether. Naman or whether the fact that my friend.

48
00:07:07,47 --> 00:07:15,64
Petroff and i set up a psychiatric service in lismore is what's responsible for the fact that there's probably.

49
00:07:15,64 --> 00:07:24,05
On a percentage by service. A few more seriously mentally ill people around him and then they have.

50
00:07:24,05 --> 00:07:32,41
They would be around tamworth. You know when you set up a psychiatric service.

51
00:07:32,88 --> 00:07:38,64
Then you what you attract a group of people who are likely to need and use that service.

52
00:07:38,64 --> 00:07:47,65
While we set up the psych service in seventy three in lismore. And women gets going in seventy three. And i think that.

53
00:07:47,65 --> 00:07:59,8
To some extent. Two things are mixed in there is only slightly more. Genuinely mentally ill people around there.

54
00:07:59,8 --> 00:08:04,61
Than they would be. In any other population. But they certainly are.

55
00:08:04,61 --> 00:08:11,79
And the capacity of that community to tolerate people whose. Mood swings.

56
00:08:12,87 --> 00:08:19,05
Can create a bit of havoc in their own lives in the eyes of a loved ones. It's probably greater out there.

57
00:08:19,05 --> 00:08:28,36
And the capacity of the community to tolerate people who live. Almost a feral. Sort of law and.

58
00:08:28,36 --> 00:08:36,48
Have some very disturbed sort of beliefs. Is certainly greit than it is elsewhere and. There's no doubt that.

59
00:08:36,48 --> 00:08:41,19
You know there is a greater incidence of madness but i don't think for a moment. That.

60
00:08:41,19 --> 00:08:47,48
That's just the environment that's producing the madness. Just drift.

61
00:08:47,48 --> 00:08:56,83
Adrift of a group of pretty deviant people into a situation where i can survive more easily and.

62
00:08:56,83 --> 00:09:18,2
Less obviously than than predict practically anywhere else in this trial yet. Oh well i mean. I only see that group of.

63
00:09:18,2 --> 00:09:30,11
Ferals who probably do have schizophrenia. I have no doubt that there is. You know shadow. I ran a central.

64
00:09:30,11 --> 00:09:33,05
Central group of.

65
00:09:33,05 --> 00:09:40,51
Heroic mad people larry as i shared with people who are less heroic

66
00:09:40,51 --> 00:09:46,07
and less mad with whom i'm never coming to any contact and.

67
00:09:46,07 --> 00:09:56,54
I think that there might have eisen is something which probably is not. Not too different from a bi sick.

68
00:09:56,54 --> 00:10:04,07
And i call rejection of the dominant paradigm just as ours was twenty years ago.

69
00:10:04,47 --> 00:10:11,79
I remember and one of the reasons that i moved out of name. Because when i left. Paradise valley after a few years.

70
00:10:12,24 --> 00:10:21,84
After ten years really. I moved into a house in town. Right in the middle of town. And one of the.

71
00:10:21,84 --> 00:10:33,5
Ferals began shooting on my front lawn. And he wasn't cries he at all he was drunk and. A few other things.

72
00:10:33,5 --> 00:10:40,36
But he certainly wasn't mentally ill or anything like that and one time after each shot on the lawn and i went out

73
00:10:40,36 --> 00:10:50,25
and walked by him on my why out of the car to go to work. I just said look that is really. Von. And i mean.

74
00:10:50,25 --> 00:10:59,7
He gave me this highly articulate. Rival about how it was his lawn. I mean it was my lawn but i mean it was his lawn.

75
00:10:59,7 --> 00:11:03,06
And i couldn't cope with that.

76
00:11:03,06 --> 00:11:10,23
I just thought i'm just i'm not going to be able to live here i mean i can hear what he's signing.

77
00:11:10,23 --> 00:11:19,9
You know this is his planet this is his long form. He has got as he said he's got a right to sheet on this loan.

78
00:11:20,56 --> 00:11:27,19
As a matter of fact at the time. I hadn't realized the rights were all bullshit.

79
00:11:27,19 --> 00:11:32,79
I must say that i have chinese doing twenty years and all. And some of my ideas have.

80
00:11:32,79 --> 00:11:41,32
Have distilled into something quite different from what i would be for so i now if somebody said something to me about

81
00:11:41,32 --> 00:11:48,04
have i had a right to shoot on my lawn. I probably wouldn't react the way i did then but i was.

82
00:11:48,04 --> 00:11:54,25
They plea moved and i couldn't think of an argument against it. And i began.

83
00:11:54,25 --> 00:12:02,11
In my mind thinking of leaving nimba because i would have to because simply because i couldn't cope with him cheating

84
00:12:02,11 --> 00:12:08,41
on my lawn but i thought it was for him to shit on my lawn. So i would have to guy.

85
00:12:08,41 --> 00:12:15,75
Because i i mean i could ask him to go. I just i remember once. On the phone.

86
00:12:15,75 --> 00:12:24,53
A fairly feral black was living there for a while and he ran up and. I had hundred dollar fine bill. On my five and.

87
00:12:24,53 --> 00:12:33,72
I said to him. This is unbelievable. You. You'll have to pony this money and he said he got me money and.

88
00:12:33,72 --> 00:12:39,94
I'm not going to piet and. Why should i pirate you know. You've got the fine.

89
00:12:39,94 --> 00:12:46,18
And you've got the money and i needed to michael a fine cause to perth and.

90
00:12:46,18 --> 00:12:50,8
I remember i burst into tears and i said well all i can do is ask you to leave.

91
00:12:50,8 --> 00:12:59,6
I can only ask you to leave we didn't have a room where you could actually sane somebody why that was a second the

92
00:12:59,6 --> 00:13:09,17
counties in where. You know when somebody asserted to me a right to be high even a why that was seriously.

93
00:13:09,17 --> 00:13:16,69
Impacting on me i couldn't think of an argument against that. And i moved off the valley. I applied the bill.

94
00:13:16,69 --> 00:13:26,56
And moved off the valley because he wouldn't. And i moved out of town. Because this guy wouldn't. Not she's on my lawn.

95
00:13:26,56 --> 00:13:49,8
And what was the question again that. Yes yes yes yes yes yes. Well i mean i've worked in my own mind now.

96
00:13:49,8 --> 00:14:02,3
I'm on to a different. I'm on a. I'm on a very different track. I i believe that there has been a serious.

97
00:14:07,37 --> 00:14:19,44
There is a cataclysm. Approaching that. Who espouse the notion of individual freedom. Personal freedom and the right.

98
00:14:19,44 --> 00:14:34,31
To do things are indeed. Now i think represent the most serious danger to the planet. But whereas i thought.

99
00:14:34,31 --> 00:14:48,28
Before that those sorts of rights. Were important for a person. To feel as if i were moving their world around them.

100
00:14:48,28 --> 00:14:57,65
I now feel of course. That that i absolutely run contrary. To a certain human connectedness. Which.

101
00:14:57,65 --> 00:15:06,17
At least i now know is much more important in me feeling like a worthwhile human being.

102
00:15:06,17 --> 00:15:10,72
Groups that are about empowerment and.

103
00:15:10,72 --> 00:15:20,37
Groups that are about still factual and groups that are about personal freedom now. I think. Terrible.

104
00:15:20,37 --> 00:15:29,05
I think it's all wrong. It's rather it's a similar problem to the problem where democracy.

105
00:15:29,05 --> 00:15:37,55
Which is one hundred fifty years old is a word and a concept. If you don camp and greeks. Where democracy. The word.

106
00:15:37,55 --> 00:15:47,66
And the via guy dear. Has actually been hijacked by a group of people who say it means freedom of choice.

107
00:15:47,66 --> 00:15:55,19
And that without the freedom to choose there is no such thing as democracy. Well of course democracy.

108
00:15:55,19 --> 00:16:00,94
In its original conception had nothing to do with the freedom of choice particularly nothing to do with the idea that

109
00:16:00,94 --> 00:16:04,69
you therefore have to have six things to choose from.

110
00:16:04,69 --> 00:16:13,05
Or you're not operating in a democracy i mean that the whole idea of bringing freedom and choice. In.

111
00:16:13,05 --> 00:16:22,97
I guess to simply boast of materialism and consumerism. Has simply been a terribly and incredibly ingenious.

112
00:16:22,97 --> 00:16:32,3
Hijacking of. One of the aspects of democracy. Into now. What democracy now means is that you have freedom to choose.

113
00:16:32,3 --> 00:16:42,84
Well. The idea that you have to be a self determining human being has been hijacked. Again.

114
00:16:42,84 --> 00:16:53,4
By a group of people who for some reason. Don't like to think that.

115
00:16:53,4 --> 00:17:01,17
In the final analysis we are responsible for other people as well as for half selves just as responsible for other

116
00:17:01,17 --> 00:17:07,21
people as ass elves i mean we are very vulnerable creatures for the first fifteen years of our life and

117
00:17:07,21 --> 00:17:14,26
and by sickly for the how all of our lives we do depend upon the goodwill of all of the other humans on the planet.

118
00:17:14,26 --> 00:17:24,77
To survive. And things like goodwill and loving kindness and all of those sorts of things.

119
00:17:24,77 --> 00:17:33,05
Actually can disappear entirely. If you insist that the most important thing for a human being to have.

120
00:17:33,05 --> 00:17:46,52
Is self-determination and. Free will because you're really arguing that. You shouldn't be cowed worst. Impacted.

121
00:17:46,52 --> 00:17:53,53
Influenced by some other person. But that's an absolute nonsense. You absolutely need.

122
00:17:53,53 --> 00:17:59,91
Advocacy influence connectedness. All of those things in order to be a human being.

123
00:17:59,91 --> 00:18:06,94
So i'm personally against the human rights movement. I have realized in the last few years. That i fail and.

124
00:18:06,94 --> 00:18:13,68
Interestingly i've never joined amnesty and i've. And i've wondered why i never. And amnesty.

125
00:18:13,68 --> 00:18:20,81
And i want to be joining amnesty. Because i don't believe that the human rights movement.

126
00:18:20,81 --> 00:18:28,66
Is the why out of a terrible problem at the moment. I think the human responsibility movement is the y. Axis.

127
00:18:28,66 --> 00:18:38,3
And i don't hear anybody talking about it. And i personally am terribly uncomfortable about.

128
00:18:38,3 --> 00:18:51,73
You know the freedom to previous say. This is just an absolutely. Unnatural start for human brain.

129
00:18:51,73 --> 00:19:03,22
And most of the things that have now entered the discourse is if i are right. I think i have very very serious pot of.

130
00:19:03,22 --> 00:19:12,74
Well i can be uncomfortable about the eilean ice in that we are building into democracies. Now.

131
00:19:12,74 --> 00:19:23,97
We're heading headlong a-y. From the human connectedness and. The tribal. Stuff. Which is just.

132
00:19:23,97 --> 00:19:50,7
Crucial to the human to human being. Yes yes. Being your brother's keeper. In the broadest sense of it. Yes.

133
00:19:50,7 --> 00:19:58,44
I am my brother's keeper. Just as i would want him to be mine and.

134
00:19:58,44 --> 00:20:04,68
You know the personal freedom and autonomy but tommy what the hell is autonomy.

135
00:20:04,68 --> 00:20:11,79
You can't move without impacting another human being whose.

136
00:20:12,13 --> 00:20:22,78
But is critical to your house you can make an action without impacting another human being whose comfort is ultimately

137
00:20:22,78 --> 00:20:39,71
going to be incredibly influential on yours. So you know i find myself now. Feeling like a totally. Voice.

138
00:20:39,71 --> 00:20:46,05
About this whole human rights issue. Because certainly i mean when i when i speak up about it. You know.

139
00:20:46,05 --> 00:20:53,7
People look at me as if i'm some sort of fascist. Maybe i am. But i'm actually coming from something which is i think.

140
00:20:53,7 --> 00:21:05,96
Deeply spiritual. But i'm happy to call that stuff. Connectedness. If. Spiritual mike's people feel i'm comfortable.

141
00:21:05,96 --> 00:21:15,79
I'm on about human connectedness the. Into dependence. Of our mind of our mental stuff and of our mental law.

142
00:21:15,79 --> 00:21:25,48
And this insistence on. Individuality. Personal autonomy. Choice and all of those sorts of things.

143
00:21:25,48 --> 00:21:34,23
I think is just the natural extension of the political disasters of the last hundred years of democracy

144
00:21:34,23 --> 00:21:45,92
and it's reinterpretation. And psychology. And it's horrendous eilean eisen. From united through.

145
00:21:45,92 --> 00:21:56,28
Empiricism and behaviorism it's. It's a leap a y.

146
00:21:56,28 --> 00:22:11,79
From law and compassion which of course are they only things that are really important things.

147
00:22:17,08 --> 00:22:28,59
Oh yes absolutely absolutely the events. The tribal of a and the concerts. The five clubs. The feasts. The dances.

148
00:22:28,59 --> 00:22:39,17
The ritual that was what it was about for me growing old with people who are now. On for twenty years. Yes.

149
00:22:39,17 --> 00:22:50,46
All of those things were the most important things. As well as for me. The actual reconnecting with growing tree and.

150
00:22:50,46 --> 00:22:57,88
And the seasons. Which i think. Deeply important for all human beings.

151
00:22:57,88 --> 00:23:03,35
And even though i lived for the first ten years of my life in the country.

152
00:23:03,35 --> 00:23:14,49
I then spent the next twenty years during my education. In the city. And i had. I had lost a lot of the. The warmth.

153
00:23:14,49 --> 00:23:20,47
And the maining. Of knowing that it was a full moon or or.

154
00:23:20,47 --> 00:23:28,34
Or that the exclusive feeling that comes the countryside after a violent storm i'm in the clear.

155
00:23:28,34 --> 00:23:33,27
I'd lost all of that stuff you do in a city you're just not conscious of whether it's winter or summer or running

156
00:23:33,27 --> 00:23:42,22
or not. The human. Tribal cell a bright tree. Things were wonderfully narcing.

157
00:23:42,22 --> 00:23:52,87
And then reconnecting with the tree and the earth was the second thing that. You know i mixed the house thing from a.

158
00:23:52,87 --> 00:24:12,65
Well it's it is what it's what. Continues to give my life its meaning. Yeah.

159
00:24:12,65 --> 00:24:24,09
Well actually the pic is both something that still goes on blue navajo sadly has been overtaken by some rather violent

160
00:24:24,09 --> 00:24:33,11
episodes of life as. In the last ten years of course has alcohols been. Become.

161
00:24:33,11 --> 00:24:41,44
It's really made a comeback in the in the alternative community certainly the level of violence has increased with the

162
00:24:41,44 --> 00:24:45,53
level of increased alcohol consumption in the first ten years or so

163
00:24:45,53 --> 00:24:53,63
when we were all just a miking diaper largely at any sort of tribal gatherings. Very much more peaceful but blue knob.

164
00:24:53,63 --> 00:24:59,76
Was of course a very special venue on the new year's eve in the full moon dances that we had a blue knob

165
00:24:59,76 --> 00:25:03,06
or weiss just with the musicians.

166
00:25:03,06 --> 00:25:10,47
Getting together getting a repertoire together for the show there were the usual musician's egos

167
00:25:10,47 --> 00:25:17,88
but basically it was often possible to have ten or fifteen people up on the stand.

168
00:25:17,88 --> 00:25:27,33
And of course we were all wanting to be heard but we were all wanting to hear each other too. For the most precious.

169
00:25:27,33 --> 00:25:39,35
And reinforcing. Parts of blue. On a saturday night on a full moon or a new year was just the most extraordinary event.

170
00:25:57,69 --> 00:26:03,02
I can't i can't walk. Brought us all together.

171
00:26:03,02 --> 00:26:11,79
Unless it was for other people as it was for me that is a tribe of like minded people who were not going to.

172
00:26:12,42 --> 00:26:24,32
Fall our career path. Which would continually disrupt their relationships with each other.

173
00:26:24,32 --> 00:26:30,05
That's what it was for may i knew that you know i had to be a successful psychiatrist i would have to mike a number of.

174
00:26:30,05 --> 00:26:38,56
Career moves that would be geographical and i would lose my group over and over again. So i think that.

175
00:26:38,56 --> 00:26:41,67
I would hazard a guess that really.

176
00:26:41,67 --> 00:26:49,89
All of the people that arrived up there with the view that i was going to study there. And not.

177
00:26:49,89 --> 00:26:55,71
Mike the usual geographical moves that go with contemporary life.

178
00:26:55,71 --> 00:27:01,73
All were there for that sign tribal reasons i wanted to mike a connection with a group of people whose vices i would

179
00:27:01,73 --> 00:27:07,49
all know. All the time and grow old without people even if i said i went there.

180
00:27:07,49 --> 00:27:12,17
So that i could get into alternative power or so i could get into anything else.

181
00:27:12,17 --> 00:27:19,63
I really feel that it was the desire to have this not primary group at woodstock.

182
00:27:19,63 --> 00:27:39,84
Still that took a saw a funny story about a name and yes. Yes. Before we moved up on to the fire.

183
00:27:42,07 --> 00:27:44,98
We used to go up there for the holidays.

184
00:27:44,98 --> 00:27:49,75
And of course we'd all had mushrooms i guess touring the festival and that sort of thing but.

185
00:27:49,75 --> 00:27:56,05
I think it was the very next holidays we all found ourselves up there would've been christmas seventy three.

186
00:27:56,05 --> 00:28:07,65
And the how. Of the group of us. The twelve of us who'd bought land america kids. Three or four kids were up there.

187
00:28:07,65 --> 00:28:11,79
And we were just arriving in dribs and drabs as we've driven up from sydney and the mushroom.

188
00:28:11,94 --> 00:28:22,63
Where athan the cash it was everywhere. And so we were going to have everyone was going to drop some mushrooms.

189
00:28:22,63 --> 00:28:28,65
And most of us. Had had some mushrooms during the festival but whether there was one.

190
00:28:29,08 --> 00:28:33,68
I wonder for a woman who had never had any mushrooms.

191
00:28:34,06 --> 00:28:41,58
And so we all talked to my friends and got into the various types that you get into.

192
00:28:42,3 --> 00:28:53,82
When you're tripping on mushrooms and all night just about an ally. That. This wonderful woman. Had grabbed the broom.

193
00:28:53,82 --> 00:29:01,31
And she was dashing around the paddock. Where we were all lying in various sites or. Or whatever.

194
00:29:01,31 --> 00:29:11,33
And she was sweeping the cap path. Into little piles. And at this point i should say she's a virgo.

195
00:29:11,33 --> 00:29:16,31
And she was always the tightest person in the car me and she was in charge of the washing up and the cooking

196
00:29:16,31 --> 00:29:22,62
and all of this sort of thing. And she had preceded the time the casket in the paddock.

197
00:29:22,62 --> 00:29:26,99
And when i said to him what the hell are you doing she said.

198
00:29:26,99 --> 00:29:39,3
When's this bloody stuff going to start with the rest of us sort of collapsed. You know.

199
00:29:40,36 --> 00:29:57,71
I think she realized that it was working. You know. You've asked me what i think about naman and drugs.

200
00:29:57,71 --> 00:30:07,51
The dockside of name the. It's now narcotics. It's very strong. Saying in niemann well obviously you know.

201
00:30:07,51 --> 00:30:13,38
From the amount of time i've been talking to you about marijuana and mushrooms and. And those sorts of things.

202
00:30:13,38 --> 00:30:21,18
For me the. The drug taking part of the name and was important. So i'm not at all surprised.

203
00:30:21,18 --> 00:30:34,85
Of course that there is no. I very obvious. Drug culture name. And not surprised that. Of course it is.

204
00:30:37,03 --> 00:30:39,56
That rather than just being.

205
00:30:39,56 --> 00:30:46,46
Mara weiner and mushrooms and nice sorts of things which of course are harmful i'm not suggesting they're not.

206
00:30:46,46 --> 00:30:53,34
But rather than it being those things it's now my colleagues. To be truthful i believe there is just one.

207
00:30:53,34 --> 00:31:02,67
Very simple explanation. But it's not an opinion that would be easy to to prove.

208
00:31:02,67 --> 00:31:16,02
But i think it is almost entirely relights. To their why the police actually three ill about people like me.

209
00:31:16,02 --> 00:31:26,44
And about all of us who've come up there. I think that the police. Well let's start a step back. I think in v.

210
00:31:26,44 --> 00:31:38,2
Is one of the most. Common human failings i mean it's not. It's not a.
