1
00:00:14,93 --> 00:00:18,79
Well the biggest success in technology that this communities achieved.

2
00:00:18,79 --> 00:00:25,81
Is not so much that we've got wonderful new brilliant. Energy systems going or anything like that.

3
00:00:25,81 --> 00:00:28,89
We've got a few demonstration projects to prove it's possible.

4
00:00:28,89 --> 00:00:33,55
We've got a big harder electrics going we've got my flying folks transport.

5
00:00:33,55 --> 00:00:39,71
The things you can actually poke a stick at the site. This is radical. Appropriate soft soft technology.

6
00:00:39,71 --> 00:00:45,35
But if you look at statistics of the whole community is lost all of the property what.

7
00:00:45,35 --> 00:00:52,03
The any why are we really winning. As far as the planet's concerned is the fact that we're not using nearly as much.

8
00:00:52,21 --> 00:00:59,18
We've got both a lot less of a sink. And we found that it doesn't really matter all that much. It's enough.

9
00:01:01,24 --> 00:01:18,38
And it's you know decisions. That. Someone said to me that you. Well it was always a bit of a nifty project.

10
00:01:18,95 --> 00:01:29,8
There was never an enormous push behind that project. Was buying more land there's always been incredible push for.

11
00:01:29,8 --> 00:01:35,73
Scenic route so that's because more growing land but that's not totally true. It's more the feeling of.

12
00:01:35,73 --> 00:01:41,28
Wishing to consolidate. People wishing for security and. I mean in this whole valley.

13
00:01:41,28 --> 00:01:47,37
Was a very important political and ideological strength behind this community.

14
00:01:47,37 --> 00:01:56,12
It meant that as a community we had last night. We had to have a conflict. Direct night as with different ideas.

15
00:01:56,12 --> 00:02:00,89
Other communities have a great big legal fight siva pesticides bryan that blows up the fences

16
00:02:00,89 --> 00:02:04,84
and things like that because we are in the whole valley we don't have that.

17
00:02:04,84 --> 00:02:09,23
On a couple of occasions fawaz have come out of the ridge line from the night. And with.

18
00:02:09,23 --> 00:02:15,9
I'm taking him to court and a couple of occasions he's come along dell logs. Of the border.

19
00:02:15,9 --> 00:02:25,37
It would made a big fuss about it. So that's about the any direction with head would be on very solid grounds.

20
00:02:25,37 --> 00:02:40,33
Was what it was on humans wonderful for tolerance. Niman is a wonderfully tolerant place. It's one place like even.

21
00:02:40,33 --> 00:02:45,35
One outside the black spots of newton. Which is the runback cafe and the freemasons hotel.

22
00:02:46,08 --> 00:02:52,57
The free license hotel is my favorite hotel anywhere. It's usually full of. Appalling music.

23
00:02:52,57 --> 00:03:02,62
Horrible looking people and people like using drugs and drinking to excess. But never in my whole.

24
00:03:02,62 --> 00:03:06,61
Twenty years of going. Frequenting that place of i've been assaulted.

25
00:03:06,61 --> 00:03:11,94
Of drunk with totally obnoxious looking back east. With undercover police.

26
00:03:11,94 --> 00:03:21,13
With some of the most suspicious looking g.b.'s people that you did see and yet there was never a threat to person.

27
00:03:21,13 --> 00:03:27,7
This is a wonderful cosmopolitan thing in that different cultures are respected.

28
00:03:27,7 --> 00:03:33,06
And you feel that you could just about walk down the street and i could act on as someone who did.

29
00:03:33,06 --> 00:03:40,03
And no one would take the slightest notice. And yet. It's also a place where you know everybody. And i know you.

30
00:03:40,03 --> 00:03:57,74
And if you desperate someone might even lend you five dollars. On dia i could go on. Yes.

31
00:03:59,91 --> 00:04:06,66
The funniest newman story i know. I guess this doesn't. I'm sure this is likely i can decide. Was that.

32
00:04:06,66 --> 00:04:10,89
One of the audio logical. Latest during a christmas festival.

33
00:04:10,89 --> 00:04:17,96
Who's very keen on place love and nonviolence and his child conceived. Equerries festival is called softly.

34
00:04:17,96 --> 00:04:26,21
Tended to be the most beautiful flower child. He actually assaulted.

35
00:04:26,21 --> 00:04:35,27
One of the still roula got dragged into court for it and the anything you could cite after being convicted was.

36
00:04:35,27 --> 00:04:49,8
I should have had the same fellow unfortunately got must've irritated some baki equally.

37
00:04:49,8 --> 00:04:53,35
And i promptly shot him in the new caps and left the body in the in the corrie up the top of the hill.

38
00:04:54,07 --> 00:05:13,65
So i sort of had total sympathy. I mean. Oh it's a most irritating man.

39
00:05:13,65 --> 00:05:19,66
This was the environment that that man shed which is possibly forgotten. Sometimes moonlight nights.

40
00:05:21,05 --> 00:05:28,2
You just come crashing out of the forest obviously having walked five kilometers through that totally on one track bush.

41
00:05:28,2 --> 00:05:36,47
In the middle of the knot and he'd have a wildfire and he saw as lucky. He was like an animal out of the forest and.

42
00:05:36,47 --> 00:05:41,73
I could relate to that because part of the whole point this is a communal communality.

43
00:05:41,73 --> 00:05:43,97
Of all the animals that live in the forest.

44
00:05:43,97 --> 00:05:46,62
I love the fact that all these animals just walk in

45
00:05:46,62 --> 00:05:52,82
and out of my house as if it's part of the track which was a wise thing. I just happen to build my house.

46
00:05:52,82 --> 00:05:56,3
At the joining of three tracks. And the animals treat it still is.

47
00:05:56,3 --> 00:06:14,36
Just exactly what it was a meeting of those three tracks. Very much so. Yes yes yes.

48
00:06:14,63 --> 00:06:18,74
It was since i started taking my friends. I was very worried about.

49
00:06:19,29 --> 00:06:27,35
What consciousness is what we who we want to do all for less fundamental spiritual questions.

50
00:06:28,51 --> 00:06:35,52
And one of the things i came to us that there wasn't any reason. They just used. And all animals that i.

51
00:06:35,52 --> 00:06:41,29
It sounds semantically tautological but that still the feel about these animals that walk around the forest.

52
00:06:41,29 --> 00:06:52,67
And i'm more no less than i am. So being able to just go by in place and have to go on as and the keys and.

53
00:06:52,67 --> 00:06:56,69
All these amazing creatures just come and look at me when i'm sitting there watching television.

54
00:06:56,69 --> 00:07:14,99
To me is that an amazing event with. Ones. You know. I don't take it that.

55
00:07:14,99 --> 00:07:18,01
I don't think there's anything wrong with squashing not flaws.

56
00:07:18,01 --> 00:07:23,69
Fact i find it quite amusing you squash them then you want to listen to them. That part of the cycle.

57
00:07:26,62 --> 00:07:33,81
So i'm not a buddhist in that sense of no form last but really just fuse off head.

58
00:07:33,81 --> 00:07:37,79
Except that i don't believe in any of them and. None of it makes sense.

59
00:07:37,79 --> 00:07:45,92
But i'm quite prepared to leave it not making sense. Strong yes.

60
00:07:45,92 --> 00:07:54,84
Of course if one doesn't mention the difference most people tend to be buddhist in the sense of. Doing old life.

61
00:07:54,84 --> 00:07:59,28
Thinking that that the mountains the trees everything has spirit. Which it does.

62
00:08:00,26 --> 00:08:05,26
Well the most beautiful spiritual times he was walking around the valley bottom then lot.

63
00:08:05,26 --> 00:08:13,12
You feel like you've come back to a probably evil. World beyond before time and. It's the middle of the dice.

64
00:08:13,12 --> 00:08:19,43
And you wearing sunglasses. That's the closest i can express what it's like to walk around this valley bahman lot.

65
00:08:19,43 --> 00:08:27,61
It's so quiet. You can hear a cough it. Five kilometers away. Usually you can even tell which carries. Now. That's.

66
00:08:27,61 --> 00:08:34,76
It's important but when you live in somewhere like sydney where you might hear a siren. Three straight so white.

67
00:08:34,76 --> 00:08:46,21
And that's about it. So yes. This valley is acoustically one unit and. You smell things here.

68
00:08:46,53 --> 00:08:54,42
It's got wonderful smell things got beautiful sounds like going mentions it not time walking around here you can you

69
00:08:54,42 --> 00:09:00,33
all of the birds. The. Different sorts of owls not just the.

70
00:09:00,33 --> 00:09:08,51
You can hear things going on in the wallabies hopping around. It's like it's a whole world happening.

71
00:09:08,51 --> 00:09:26,97
It's just the there are people dominating. We just one more not animal walking around in.

72
00:09:26,97 --> 00:09:32,77
Music was almost the driving force in this culture. This aquarian culture.

73
00:09:32,83 --> 00:09:39,11
We had the protest movement we had bob dylan joan brought us all of those people. And i really created the dream.

74
00:09:39,11 --> 00:09:47,27
I mentioned before we broke celtic in fusion rock. But it's also the ballad. You get people like john barr to sing.

75
00:09:47,27 --> 00:09:56,84
The scene. About. Like the circle song as one of the classic. It's about the circle of life and. One of the key lines.

76
00:09:56,84 --> 00:10:02,3
About the boy. He will change the car will strew the town.

77
00:10:02,3 --> 00:10:10,53
And then the next person and his dreams of lost that granger coming through. I see a lot of the people around me.

78
00:10:10,53 --> 00:10:14,36
Feeling a little bit sort of jaded about the tunnel experience. And it's sometimes.

79
00:10:14,56 --> 00:10:22,63
Hills a bit like a a hole and i camp. Or some much like a bitch. Place where people go to a top. And die.

80
00:10:22,63 --> 00:10:31,01
But i think partly it's because the dreams that come true. That's lost. And it's all sort of worn off a bit.

81
00:10:31,01 --> 00:10:35,76
Because sometimes it's not the reality of what's happened but the why the. People feel about it.

82
00:10:35,76 --> 00:10:48,6
Which affects the why they talk about it. So i feel it was inspirational. Creating a new vision. Thing which is being.

83
00:10:48,6 --> 00:10:57,87
What the led zeppelin song. Stairway to heaven. That was one of the humans. Of our movement and.

84
00:10:57,87 --> 00:11:07,35
Everyone can play that song on the guitar. It's just one of the sort of. Rites of passage in this community. And the.

85
00:11:07,35 --> 00:11:14,15
The forest will echo with laughter. Is one of the westernizing lines in the middle of that song.

86
00:11:14,15 --> 00:11:19,47
And it's funny because it brings together the two elements of this culture which i've always found contradictory.

87
00:11:19,47 --> 00:11:26,05
Ones to the forest echoing the laughter the solids. On the other hand. The incredible.

88
00:11:26,05 --> 00:11:30,44
Noise with which most people play music around here.

89
00:11:30,44 --> 00:11:31,7
Right from beginning bobbie cries

90
00:11:31,7 --> 00:11:35,33
and scalpels down there which was the nearest point is electricity where you could plug in a thousand

91
00:11:35,33 --> 00:11:45,79
and one amplifier. Was shaking and shocking the whole valley with really quite miserable doors top. Rock and roll and.

92
00:11:45,79 --> 00:11:51,54
All the concerts round here. I couldn't really like his cultural and learn to wear earplugs. And now.

93
00:11:51,54 --> 00:11:55,74
Before i go to do any concert round here i pluck up my ears with with toilet paper.

94
00:11:55,74 --> 00:12:00,44
And you simply have to run a few reasons i think that i've got still my hearing.

95
00:12:00,44 --> 00:12:04,43
With many people around here are quite different. It's one of the.

96
00:12:04,43 --> 00:12:10,14
Most theories about the communication between people. Is extremely simple.

97
00:12:10,14 --> 00:12:14,36
People don't communicate because half the people are too stunned.

98
00:12:14,75 --> 00:12:20,08
To talk out here at least the other half to death here and. You know.

99
00:12:20,08 --> 00:12:29,35
I think that the communications the lifeblood of any community and we're not doing enough to have one scene.

100
00:12:32,47 --> 00:12:43,04
Well that's what twenty five. We've collected. Yes. The. The burden of being seen as a visionary santa is wonderful.

101
00:12:43,04 --> 00:12:46,78
For example my immediate neighborhood. Is now totally repopulated.

102
00:12:46,78 --> 00:12:53,37
On the only person who's there in the original hamlet. All the people have come adjournments except for one tiny.

103
00:12:53,37 --> 00:13:00,01
Was not all that christian from. Up in queensland. But. All of the others the germans.

104
00:13:00,01 --> 00:13:06,4
Germans know more about nimbin than astride and stu. It's considered a mecca for anti-authoritarian forces.

105
00:13:06,4 --> 00:13:10,78
With the call themselves. Jockeys around it is to well. It doesn't really matter.

106
00:13:10,78 --> 00:13:16,92
The point is the anti the state and the bin i have inspected i have a defected i was really think.

107
00:13:16,92 --> 00:13:24,23
In germany by an excessively efficient public service. They come here to a skype it is the opposite point of the globe.

108
00:13:24,23 --> 00:13:30,08
As the opposite in culturally. And for that reason we've got all these wonderful immigrant germans.

109
00:13:30,08 --> 00:13:33,63
Who are skilled ambitious.

110
00:13:33,63 --> 00:13:40,66
Old enough and have the wherewithal to be constructive and mild and i've always been totally rebuilt.

111
00:13:40,66 --> 00:13:45,00
You know wonderful why by the. Ingress of all these wonderful germans.

112
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:55,37
So it's attracted a lot of negative attention from government bureaucracies. For example if i. When i get.

113
00:13:55,37 --> 00:14:00,8
Regularly stopped. Because i drive an old car. I was looking for lawson's and.

114
00:14:00,8 --> 00:14:04,28
The fact that the law says the wrong gender doesn't seem to both of them.

115
00:14:04,28 --> 00:14:07,23
What bothers them is this is the would tolerable foals.

116
00:14:07,23 --> 00:14:13,9
Like promptly get out and start searching the cuff marihuana the image of the place. Is got a lot of attention.

117
00:14:13,9 --> 00:14:22,58
Unwanted. But police and. Drug traffickers in general. It was beautifully ambiguous.

118
00:14:23,24 --> 00:14:30,41
But yes it's been also wonderful drawcard. But we've got an unbelievable string of tele did.

119
00:14:30,41 --> 00:14:36,65
Wonderful people come to this property. Most of whom with used polling and consumed and spat out.

120
00:14:36,65 --> 00:14:41,8
My biggest guilt about this community has helped pull the we've seen many of the very talented. Adil it.

121
00:14:41,8 --> 00:14:50,26
Adia logically. Motivated people. Because what's happened to this community is built of the. The cream and the dregs.

122
00:14:50,26 --> 00:14:57,16
The bus come together where i'm selective and often i'm not quite sure. Sometimes. Which category to put people in.

123
00:14:57,16 --> 00:14:59,93
It's not that i'm being judgmental. It's just simply.

124
00:14:59,93 --> 00:15:05,56
The fact that people come here sometimes for their own purposes and sometimes the community purposes.

125
00:15:08,03 --> 00:15:22,79
Just occasionally enlightened self interest. Like some sort of but masters. I can't write my name is sally spain and.

126
00:15:22,79 --> 00:15:31,36
I came to newman. In one hundred seventy six like nine hundred seventy six and. I've lived here. On and off since then.

127
00:15:31,36 --> 00:15:37,47
On and off because some of the time i go over the border. The aborigines used to call this country.

128
00:15:37,47 --> 00:15:43,35
The country of the men. And ice into this armies. On mount warning. And the terrain here.

129
00:15:43,35 --> 00:15:50,46
Is rougher than where i grew up which is just over the border in south east queensland. Which kath walker once told me.

130
00:15:50,46 --> 00:15:55,26
Was with stradbroke on and then. And mt tamborine the country. Of the women.

131
00:15:55,26 --> 00:16:01,12
And i find that the values that are expressed in both of these places one on each side of the border.

132
00:16:01,12 --> 00:16:05,94
Are part and parcel of the same thing. I don't know how many people would agree with me.

133
00:16:05,94 --> 00:16:12,11
Because a lot of the people who came to newman. And some of them were the very best of our generation.

134
00:16:12,11 --> 00:16:19,29
Came from sydney and. In those days we had. Because of the hard work of our parents' generation.

135
00:16:19,29 --> 00:16:27,66
A lot of freedom to discuss and talk about the ideas. And out of the universities and the colleges and the workplaces.

136
00:16:27,66 --> 00:16:34,39
They came a feeling that it would be good in in view of some of the crises that seem to be be setting the world.

137
00:16:34,39 --> 00:16:40,85
To set up an ideal society. And young and naive as we were. I think we expected to walk out of the country and.

138
00:16:40,85 --> 00:16:48,53
Set one up. Just like that. Of course twenty years later. When people talk about it. That's fine. Yes. It's heartening.

139
00:16:48,78 --> 00:16:49,6
You sure.

140
00:16:49,6 --> 00:16:52,78
Of course twenty years later when people talk about it i see the vision

141
00:16:52,78 --> 00:16:57,87
and i also see some of the disappointments as well as some of the things that have been achieved.

142
00:16:57,87 --> 00:16:59,56
I think in our generation.

143
00:16:59,56 --> 00:17:05,4
And the generations later on haven't had such total freedom because of the economic times that came upon us.

144
00:17:05,4 --> 00:17:12,64
We had an opportunity to express some of the things that we believed in which was a whole lifestyle with with trust

145
00:17:12,64 --> 00:17:20,2
and friendship with people and. Some connection to the earth again and. A rural community. Fresh air and.

146
00:17:20,2 --> 00:17:22,13
Freedom to bring about children.

147
00:17:22,13 --> 00:17:29,65
Perhaps in a way outside of the city areas and so on and i think in a lot of cases some of this has been achieved.

148
00:17:29,65 --> 00:17:33,2
In other cases it hasn't. Because people have got side tracked.

149
00:17:33,2 --> 00:17:36,86
Drugs were a problem with adj interaction and they were other issues too.

150
00:17:36,86 --> 00:17:42,71
But newman and you know why has been a learning center. Many more people than are actually here now. Have passed by.

151
00:17:42,71 --> 00:17:47,68
And some of them have learnt difficult lessons here because it wasn't easy to come from.

152
00:17:47,68 --> 00:17:53,15
At least a samia been lifestyle. And suddenly plant oneself in a rural area.

153
00:17:53,15 --> 00:17:57,96
But some of the people who have come here have found friendship. I think.

154
00:17:57,96 --> 00:18:02,26
From some of them found disappointment also because of course the vision.

155
00:18:02,26 --> 00:18:06,01
Couldn't always be immediately realized or even ever realized perhaps.

156
00:18:06,01 --> 00:18:12,18
But it doesn't mean that a lot of the people you haven't held on to the principles that i espoused when i

157
00:18:12,18 --> 00:18:23,22
when i dropped out as that was what was called in the. Days. That's what i think of right now you.

158
00:18:23,22 --> 00:18:29,03
Yeah i think probably some partly that's contributed to by the terrain i mean in a sense.

159
00:18:29,03 --> 00:18:31,46
We're doing both things because we live in queensland.

160
00:18:31,46 --> 00:18:38,78
And my husband works and we've got our children now at school are taught them in the early years. But.

161
00:18:38,78 --> 00:18:42,38
To a degree we've got we've got rough terrain and.

162
00:18:42,38 --> 00:18:46,6
To walk across to our neighbors there is something that you can't really do.

163
00:18:46,6 --> 00:18:51,53
Because you've got to sort of hack your way through or go. Right round via a long way. And i think.

164
00:18:51,53 --> 00:18:55,83
Just dealing with planting which is and building houses and.

165
00:18:55,83 --> 00:18:58,81
Looking after children it might mean that people don't associate.

166
00:18:58,81 --> 00:19:02,46
But otherwise i think they do when i was here more full time.

167
00:19:02,46 --> 00:19:06,45
And the little school was down there the children was at the kindergarten and.

168
00:19:06,45 --> 00:19:10,42
I would go down to be part of the committee of the school and i think through group endeavors.

169
00:19:10,42 --> 00:19:16,67
People get a lot of their social life where i might hop skip across to a neighbor because of the actual nature of the

170
00:19:16,67 --> 00:19:28,48
terrain. I don't know that answer your questions. Was sure i think that's right.

171
00:19:28,48 --> 00:19:33,38
And that's what we were talking about before i think if you have a community where it's group life.

172
00:19:33,38 --> 00:19:36,55
Then you make some sacrifices to be part of the group.

173
00:19:36,55 --> 00:19:41,6
And sometimes that's that's individual and such individual ready and sometimes.

174
00:19:41,6 --> 00:19:48,1
That means that you have to bow to group pressures and. Sometimes the group is wrong. So there's always that danger.

175
00:19:48,1 --> 00:19:52,57
I mean sometimes it's correct you get some energy from people being different and you're free to be different.

176
00:19:52,57 --> 00:19:57,57
Amongst them. And to express what you feel you should express. But on the other hand.

177
00:19:57,57 --> 00:20:03,67
There is that there is too only by the group. And i think that can happen too. And that's something that.

178
00:20:03,67 --> 00:20:07,91
That would bother me i think you know why because i tend to like to people on an individual level.

179
00:20:07,91 --> 00:20:14,36
So i found beautiful friends here. But. But i avoid the tribal meetings because it bothers me that some decision.

180
00:20:14,48 --> 00:20:23,65
Can be made and perhaps that's an unjust decision. Not always but it can mean.

181
00:20:23,65 --> 00:20:46,41
It's a reflection of what it does mean and it's. I mean it's just you know i think there are things there are.

182
00:20:46,41 --> 00:20:52,17
There are great lessons that can be learnt from what's happened here. But there's also with every step forward.

183
00:20:52,17 --> 00:20:57,4
Sometimes i think there's a step backwards i mean people here are more conscious of a healthy lifestyle. And night.

184
00:20:57,4 --> 00:21:03,45
They are more conscious of having organic food. But because they landed in a run for us sometimes.

185
00:21:03,45 --> 00:21:09,08
Hygiene and sanitation. Was slack whereas if you. If you went up to the causeway the councils had more control.

186
00:21:09,08 --> 00:21:10,74
In the hinterland their.

187
00:21:10,74 --> 00:21:11,33
Sanitation was all right

188
00:21:11,33 --> 00:21:15,96
but people might not realize so much about that there were alternative ways of dealing with health problems

189
00:21:15,96 --> 00:21:20,94
and things like that. It was. It was always very dualistic. That's what i found.

190
00:21:20,94 --> 00:21:27,61
I mean if i breastfed the children here. Publicly to a light. That was never a problem. If i did it up there.

191
00:21:27,61 --> 00:21:33,87
You know over the border. That was more conspicuous. But if i fed the children sweets down here.

192
00:21:33,87 --> 00:21:38,94
Which i think is perfectly correct. Then that might be a cause of some neighborly interference.

193
00:21:38,94 --> 00:21:44,35
If i fed them sweets out there. That was not a problem. It was like that always i was had that experience.

194
00:21:44,61 --> 00:21:45,91
If i birth the children at home.

195
00:21:46,78 --> 00:21:51,66
Up there which i did because our house wasn't finished and my mother was up there she was a midwife.

196
00:21:51,66 --> 00:21:56,71
Then that wasn't a problem. Here people said that home birth is fine. And in those days i had.

197
00:21:56,71 --> 00:22:01,23
I had no feeling of going near a hospital i had three healthy children. But.

198
00:22:01,23 --> 00:22:04,51
But if i if i was home birthing out there people would. Would cite.

199
00:22:04,51 --> 00:22:09,99
Good heavens how and got it off you saw i always had this experience of living between.

200
00:22:09,99 --> 00:22:14,36
But not so much now i think that some of the ideas that were that were current and that were good.

201
00:22:14,4 --> 00:22:21,05
The ideas that came here. Have spread widely so that when i say to my cousins. Look you don't have to come up here.

202
00:22:21,05 --> 00:22:25,58
To see you know if you've been. Being true to your traditions these training traditions of.

203
00:22:25,58 --> 00:22:31,72
Of looking after your children and having. Basic morality. And giving them. You know healthy lifestyle and.

204
00:22:31,72 --> 00:22:36,91
Keeping them in touch with nature. Then that women are different to them i mean it's not so different now.

205
00:22:36,91 --> 00:22:54,19
So much as you know. Because i don't know i draw a lot of strength from beautiful people who are here. You know.

206
00:22:54,19 --> 00:22:58,15
That have come i mean i've met some extraordinary songs here. Who came.

207
00:22:58,15 --> 00:23:03,42
You know with the most beautiful ideas and managed to manifest them but.

208
00:23:03,42 --> 00:23:09,53
But also i mean we had people who were traveling through who were who were. You know out of it.

209
00:23:09,53 --> 00:23:14,42
Who had had had too many drugs who were difficult to deal with we've had both very extreme.

210
00:23:14,42 --> 00:23:19,86
And i've been more free to express themselves here and i would have in other places. But i don't draw.

211
00:23:19,86 --> 00:23:21,88
So much from the group life as a whole that i did

212
00:23:21,88 --> 00:23:27,19
when the children were going to the kindergarten so it was very much a group. Parent sort of endeavor.

213
00:23:27,19 --> 00:23:33,59
But i do draw from from the people who you felt. To come here. Some friendships. So i guess that's the way out.

214
00:23:33,59 --> 00:23:39,69
But that's just i think that's to do with my personality too. I don't know i wouldn't like i didn't like school.

215
00:23:39,69 --> 00:23:55,74
Large groups very much. Anyway. In first place. So it seems odd to have come to a commune. But here in st louis. And.

216
00:24:00,48 --> 00:24:01,55
I think it can be.

217
00:24:01,55 --> 00:24:07,87
Yes i've seen good people who've had good ideas and have been arrested and criticised for them and who've left

218
00:24:07,87 --> 00:24:12,44
and i've seen good strong people who've managed to put their point of view and have stayed.

219
00:24:12,99 --> 00:24:20,74
I think because we were such a low. Generation. Everybody had their opinions and some of them were very good. But that.

220
00:24:20,74 --> 00:24:23,53
That cause people conflict i think that's that sort of thing

221
00:24:23,53 --> 00:24:28,52
and also also seen incredible wisdom in people in that many thing to deal with other people

222
00:24:28,52 --> 00:24:35,12
and to to draw on experiences to to know themselves more and to mature. I've seen both. Really.

223
00:24:35,12 --> 00:24:41,88
I've seen people who are deluded and still are. And i've seen people who've. Who have realized.

224
00:24:41,88 --> 00:24:47,85
Well what did comes down to any in which is that they go to consciousness if you like the fact that god created the

225
00:24:47,85 --> 00:24:53,4
planet and that they had it. They had to care for it and to care for other people i've seen people reach that stage.

226
00:24:53,4 --> 00:25:03,62
And i've seen people. Miss it completely. Both. That's right. Yeah bitch.

227
00:25:04,1 --> 00:25:07,95
You know but it probably did me good i certainly was challenged

228
00:25:07,95 --> 00:25:12,06
and we had thousands of people it seemed like coming through here before the house was built.

229
00:25:12,06 --> 00:25:15,78
The early days were pretty hectic i had little children.

230
00:25:15,78 --> 00:25:20,52
All the things that other people dealt with no water and things like that first that kind of stuff.

231
00:25:20,77 --> 00:25:27,31
But i had it easier than some because i did guard crossed of the boat. Across the border saw that i would co-parent it.

232
00:25:27,31 --> 00:25:32,36
By my mother. And david had work to do sometimes up there so we were coming back and forth.

233
00:25:32,36 --> 00:25:40,37
Some people had it harder than that. You know. That's true. But on the other hand i think some people will hopefully.

234
00:25:40,37 --> 00:25:49,53
I feel that i drew drew support from the group in that. Hard times more. When you reckon that's right. Gone.

235
00:25:49,53 --> 00:25:54,33
Yeah when you get both. That's right. Yeah. And it's tricky it's painful when you get somebody criticising.

236
00:25:54,33 --> 00:25:59,82
I mean i married david and came here and i didn't agree with that rule that they should be no dogs.

237
00:25:59,82 --> 00:26:04,07
I can understand people's logic behind it because there are lots of paddy melons and stuff like that.

238
00:26:04,07 --> 00:26:09,92
But i never would have come to a community where there weren't dogs. So when i tried to bring dogs in and.

239
00:26:09,92 --> 00:26:14,36
Just followed my feelings on that. Because i really think that that. People and animals.

240
00:26:14,56 --> 00:26:20,92
Should be close i think that's why christ was born in a stable. Shot at the animals and people are meant to be close.

241
00:26:20,92 --> 00:26:26,93
And we had the sort of dogs that didn't chase paddy melons but i got into a lot of conflict there and that was hurtful.

242
00:26:26,93 --> 00:26:31,78
But it is i suppose that happens in any walk of life and to a degree. You know.

243
00:26:31,78 --> 00:26:46,4
All the people who want more overt about it here. I don't know if they saw me going oh yeah we say no that's right.

244
00:26:46,4 --> 00:26:50,57
And this is that's what david says my husband. This is the the biggest.

245
00:26:50,57 --> 00:26:54,71
Land cooperative of people have come together and that's one of these donnish really good things about it that.

246
00:26:54,71 --> 00:26:58,53
You said once the fact that people with a tiny bit of capital.

247
00:26:58,53 --> 00:27:02,7
And we were lucky because from david's father we had more capital and other people to set up fruit trees

248
00:27:02,7 --> 00:27:08,08
and to help build a house. But for people with small amount of capital i can get access to land.

249
00:27:08,08 --> 00:27:14,87
And the land has always been locked in a study from. Earliest times. And so that's that's. That was very important.

250
00:27:14,87 --> 00:27:19,55
That was revolutionary and that's something that should be observed.

251
00:27:19,55 --> 00:27:25,88
On the other hand that had it probably its problems too because we. Where we are here were insulated by a creek.

252
00:27:25,88 --> 00:27:28,05
And it. And the forest at the back.

253
00:27:28,05 --> 00:27:32,7
But some people who might have had such a strong personality might have got pushed more into a corner.

254
00:27:32,7 --> 00:27:37,18
In earlier times and not been allowed to have so much land as somebody else who was.

255
00:27:37,18 --> 00:27:39,42
Because it wasn't all set up with rules and regulations.

256
00:27:39,58 --> 00:27:43,96
I think since going on carpeted you might have more fear by trying to make it.

257
00:27:43,96 --> 00:28:03,61
Spelled out at the beginning who could be where and what i had. When. Yeah. Because i haven't seen it. Is that right.

258
00:28:03,61 --> 00:28:08,99
That's what you're talking about there is an icky isn't it. And that. That's the spirit. That's in heaven.

259
00:28:08,99 --> 00:28:14,36
I mean if everybody who had come here. Had had that heavenly vision and had managed to hang on to it.

260
00:28:14,69 --> 00:28:19,27
And you wouldn't have ever had any problem. And that a lot of them did.

261
00:28:19,27 --> 00:28:24,67
But also it was very quickly earth with the with a lot of. Disputes which i guess what.

262
00:28:24,67 --> 00:28:27,73
Had to happen in the physical reality

263
00:28:27,73 --> 00:28:38,02
but that that heavenly vision i don't have any doubt that people had it's really strange but i follow. I follow.

264
00:28:38,02 --> 00:28:47,55
Astrology and and. Our generation was a leo generation that's why i was such an argumentative talkers. But i also had.

265
00:28:47,55 --> 00:28:49,44
They lead i was in pisces which is that.

266
00:28:49,44 --> 00:28:54,53
Which is the sign of the person who is at they all a stage of life and has a heavenly vision.

267
00:28:54,53 --> 00:28:59,64
As well as an earthly vision that's while people sit and dream. They're in heaven. Away.

268
00:28:59,64 --> 00:29:06,18
And so we got our heavenly vision at that age. Some people get it at a different age and.

269
00:29:06,18 --> 00:29:14,78
Everybody has their chance i think to to envision something of that. That christ like thing on the earth.

270
00:29:14,78 --> 00:29:21,69
And i think people did have that but of course. You know. The earth is not perfect.

271
00:29:21,69 --> 00:29:23,45
So some of the things that were done were perfect

272
00:29:23,45 --> 00:29:31,97
and some of them weren't that's a patty it's just that he keeps coming around to the same point to some point. Right.

273
00:29:31,97 --> 00:29:48,58
Good. So yeah right. You know. Oh yes. I think that's probably too i mean true we had we had a fine education and.

274
00:29:48,58 --> 00:29:56,02
I know. We had a lot of skills. From that but i know that. We had more than a lot of other generation's experience.

275
00:29:56,02 --> 00:30:01,26
Of classrooms. To a very light. Age. Especially the ones who went on to to show institutions.

276
00:30:01,26 --> 00:30:02,48
And i know that the early days

277
00:30:02,48 --> 00:30:08,21
and nimbin were partly at a childhood that was played out i mean there was a lot of fun people.

278
00:30:08,21 --> 00:30:13,12
People didn't have no clothes and i didn't walk all over the place. And dance and sing i mean there was that.

279
00:30:13,12 --> 00:30:21,34
Crazy sort of summer of. Of just an innocence in a way. I mean that. That brought its problems too but.

280
00:30:21,34 --> 00:30:27,7
But in a way that. That was a childhood that some people had never had that. I dropped out to to enjoy.

281
00:30:27,7 --> 00:30:34,39
And as a was happens that. There are people with i don't go through a certain stage you've got to do it later.

282
00:30:34,39 --> 00:30:36,78
And a lot of people had a freedom and.

283
00:30:36,78 --> 00:30:43,43
That was that was very beautiful it was it was a celebration there were some very good things that the people enjoyed

284
00:30:43,43 --> 00:30:57,24
in terms of. Just just being free for a lot of innocence well.

285
00:30:57,24 --> 00:31:03,08
People are not longer young i guess and it's not appropriate. I don't think. To try and call that back. That back.

286
00:31:03,08 --> 00:31:09,36
That was a special time i mean there are echoes of it all around but i think that that was a time that was given.

287
00:31:09,36 --> 00:31:15,58
And then you're supposed to get the messages from your time and. Realize the things that you dreamt of.

288
00:31:15,58 --> 00:31:19,74
So i don't think that that's appropriate now. But it was appropriate then.

289
00:31:19,74 --> 00:31:27,02
It was a very special freedom and they were very special friendships. And. And of course.

290
00:31:27,02 --> 00:31:33,11
Many previous generations have been to tightly control and. Six your morality comes into that.
