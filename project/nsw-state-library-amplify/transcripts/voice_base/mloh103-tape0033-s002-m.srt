1
00:00:13,83 --> 00:00:22,51
I was very interested in fact that i wanted equality. Equality and parenting and shit parenting and.

2
00:00:22,51 --> 00:00:28,19
All that we had a commitment to get those notions. I found that with young children that wasn't necessarily the kites.

3
00:00:29,75 --> 00:00:38,18
There was i said so sinking back to the notion of it. That the mother would look after the children. And that that.

4
00:00:39,74 --> 00:00:42,01
Men would go out and be active in the world.

5
00:00:44,26 --> 00:00:50,22
So it's very was a really interesting consummated start negotiating that was going on to say look i don't want to

6
00:00:50,22 --> 00:00:56,44
anyway and i'm on the importance. And the joy. Of nurturing young children.

7
00:00:56,95 --> 00:01:04,79
It wasn't in any wife and they need to move away from sally and john of. My rights to equality and.

8
00:01:04,79 --> 00:01:15,02
To encourage others to me specifically. To participate in equal parenting. And i think that's a whole other dog.

9
00:01:15,02 --> 00:01:18,54
The points of nutrients of young children. And you know.

10
00:01:18,54 --> 00:01:22,92
I think the longer that they really truly nurtured and kept away from institutions like schools.

11
00:01:24,95 --> 00:01:29,32
Anyway building the house. So i decided to build a house. So i did.

12
00:01:29,32 --> 00:01:38,92
And i got tremendous support from my extended family. I had virtually no money. Will.

13
00:01:38,92 --> 00:01:42,92
I got tremendous support from my extended family and great support from sally and. Yes.

14
00:01:42,92 --> 00:01:50,78
I mean john salley very helpful i used to help me saw through the door and through the things i learned.

15
00:01:50,78 --> 00:01:54,95
But to see me in a different lot to many of the children i think that their mother was a builder

16
00:01:54,95 --> 00:01:59,96
and their mother was active in providing their own shelter and things like that and i love to be able to

17
00:01:59,96 --> 00:02:04,17
and i found that i love. The activity of building. I found it very.

18
00:02:04,17 --> 00:02:10,16
I found it very liberating if i can use that fairly. Abused wood. Because i really.

19
00:02:11,75 --> 00:02:18,91
I could make all my own decisions myself. I could have this building exactly as i wanted it.

20
00:02:18,91 --> 00:02:25,52
I could build in whatever i wanted. And i could do it. It really wasn't so difficult and.

21
00:02:25,52 --> 00:02:30,9
Really was for me the beginning of a lot of debunking of my own myths. I think you know.

22
00:02:30,9 --> 00:02:34,58
I mean i think education's been very minute i think.

23
00:02:34,58 --> 00:02:38,52
Shelter has been very on my main i say in recent times of course because traditionally

24
00:02:38,52 --> 00:02:42,17
and i'm talking about you know hundreds and thousands of years ago. Women who.

25
00:02:42,17 --> 00:02:49,85
All of those things the healers in the witches. And the educators and the builders. And the goddess.

26
00:02:49,85 --> 00:02:58,61
So it was great for me to do that because it was really in keeping with my feminist. Growing feminist.

27
00:02:58,61 --> 00:03:03,81
I got a lot of support from my friends it helped me to be very organized. Like a lot of the people in the family.

28
00:03:03,81 --> 00:03:08,86
Several of the people in the would come and help me on a saturday. And i would just organize everything.

29
00:03:08,86 --> 00:03:15,57
Get everything and then i just use this guy and generously donated to put all the pieces.

30
00:03:15,57 --> 00:03:24,06
Put the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together and thought it up the next day and. It was just great i loved it.

31
00:03:24,06 --> 00:03:26,52
Many of my women friends came and helped.

32
00:03:26,52 --> 00:03:33,13
And then started coming in asking how do you do this to imagine how do you do it and.

33
00:03:33,13 --> 00:03:37,85
Are the tell them what i knew which i learned from other builders watching how the buildings being built.

34
00:03:37,85 --> 00:03:42,12
Running down every friday afternoon at five o'clock and consulting bill chart of the local.

35
00:03:42,91 --> 00:03:48,78
How much spice do you need around. How many millimeters g.-a leave you know. In the gap for a door and.

36
00:03:48,78 --> 00:03:50,63
Various things like that.

37
00:03:50,63 --> 00:03:55,33
So i'd gotten my get my knowledge from books and from people and from builders in every way i could

38
00:03:55,33 --> 00:03:58,01
and then i was really happy to pass that information on the guy

39
00:03:58,01 --> 00:04:05,03
and i think i mentioned earlier i really believe that full information is liberation in a way or is the way to. Growth.

40
00:04:05,03 --> 00:04:10,16
So i thought was no reason that i should hold this information secret to myself.

41
00:04:10,43 --> 00:04:18,39
And become part of the mycenaeans top club. So i was really happy to pass that information on to women and in.

42
00:04:21,17 --> 00:04:23,17
So many women started asking me that had you do this

43
00:04:23,17 --> 00:04:27,54
or how do you do that i thought i would just run a women's building course.

44
00:04:27,54 --> 00:04:30,11
That might sound a very presumptuous and bold but.

45
00:04:30,11 --> 00:04:32,43
You know we decided to start a school prom

46
00:04:32,43 --> 00:04:39,41
or school so that our kids could be educated in animal caring loving creative way so we've done that

47
00:04:39,41 --> 00:04:43,85
and i thought well you know i started school what's you know. Running courses for kids why not start.

48
00:04:43,85 --> 00:04:48,26
And i've been teaching catherine join me in the school kids.

49
00:04:48,26 --> 00:04:51,47
Particularly interested in teaching the young girls' schools.

50
00:04:51,47 --> 00:05:01,7
So i sort of front of up to the local type college and so on a building course for women. And they were rather.

51
00:05:01,7 --> 00:05:08,00
In the chapter woods agreement was rather shocked and surprised and scratched his head. So i did.

52
00:05:09,24 --> 00:05:15,84
And that was great that was and i ran building courses for women for many. Not full time.

53
00:05:15,84 --> 00:05:22,91
But every time i felt there was a need within any community like the newman community or broader communities.

54
00:05:22,91 --> 00:05:29,53
When so i gathered enough. Women together. Wasn't that i gather them the sort of the interest would start to.

55
00:05:31,00 --> 00:05:34,5
Simmer not so we'll gather a group of twelve to twenty women around you and

56
00:05:34,5 --> 00:05:38,88
when you think you got the numbers will approach the college and. We were very lucky.

57
00:05:38,88 --> 00:05:43,58
It was in those days of supporting women's education. And in fact.

58
00:05:43,58 --> 00:05:47,79
Encouraging women's education particularly in nontraditional so-called. Non-traditional areas.

59
00:05:48,1 --> 00:05:51,34
So i was very lucky to continue to be able to get funding to do that

60
00:05:51,34 --> 00:06:00,44
and in the eighty's i've gone on to run a couple of courses which were not founded by a state government institution

61
00:06:00,44 --> 00:06:27,45
or government institution but. Funded. Privately by women. And it's not that. So that's been fun. Yep that's spot on.

62
00:06:27,45 --> 00:06:28,19
There was a lot of.

63
00:06:28,19 --> 00:06:33,25
There was a lot of that show that is a must because we called the chauvinism in those days it's almost tended to stop

64
00:06:33,25 --> 00:06:43,96
using i think. Yes. The notion of barefoot and pregnant. For women in long frocks as will. Was prevalent.

65
00:06:43,96 --> 00:06:48,78
I mean it was one of the issues that are really felt uncomfortable about.

66
00:06:48,78 --> 00:06:53,87
I didn't necessarily feel uncomfortable about it within my own household sphere.

67
00:06:53,87 --> 00:07:00,43
Because we had some fairly strong women in that household. We all had our deficiencies and.

68
00:07:00,43 --> 00:07:08,93
Hang ups and things like that but by sickly we encouraged each other in. You know. Focus to our interests.

69
00:07:08,93 --> 00:07:16,6
But yeah that. That was very it still alarms me. It still horrifies me. That in the so-called. Alternative society.

70
00:07:16,6 --> 00:07:24,59
That there is such an ism to use that would. There is such disrespect for women's equal rights.

71
00:07:25,3 --> 00:07:28,31
I mean you know we still live in a society where women don't get equal priority.

72
00:07:30,54 --> 00:07:34,47
You know women still get something like sixty seven percent of the average wage.

73
00:07:34,47 --> 00:07:39,87
You know it's that's the broader community. And i don't think that the alternative society.

74
00:07:39,87 --> 00:07:44,11
As you know diced and did very much for women's rights that while.

75
00:07:44,11 --> 00:07:48,8
I know that a lot of women have gained their power and gone ahead and built houses and fixed cars

76
00:07:48,8 --> 00:07:55,15
and been leaders of communities and community late is and.

77
00:07:55,15 --> 00:07:59,97
We even have unfortunately now three women in this most city council who are older women

78
00:07:59,97 --> 00:08:04,00
and women that are called older men still. I mean those things have occurred.

79
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:11,89
But i don't really even see this still very much. Shift of consciousness. Amongst most of the population. Around.

80
00:08:11,89 --> 00:08:22,65
Women's rights. It's you know this is this this sort of. Is this sickness that strikes relationships.

81
00:08:22,65 --> 00:08:28,79
Quite often when people hit her sexual couples who have children and it's sort of like.

82
00:08:28,79 --> 00:08:33,76
I have this notion about radicals i'll talk about that my notion of radicals many of us were radicals was seen as

83
00:08:33,76 --> 00:08:36,75
radicals were quite radical we were doing radically different things.

84
00:08:36,75 --> 00:08:44,18
And one of my notions women of my theories about radicals is that. Come a certain i. Time.

85
00:08:44,18 --> 00:08:53,46
And it's often ran about thirty and. People who are radical in the use sort of get confronted with this.

86
00:08:55,66 --> 00:08:56,55
Energy why will something

87
00:08:56,55 --> 00:09:02,71
and i go oh my god of i still got to keep making up the rules for myself about relationships about equality about work

88
00:09:02,71 --> 00:09:08,46
about social issues all that sort of thing. And it is sort of you know the sort of a certain fatigue sometimes hits.

89
00:09:08,46 --> 00:09:15,46
People about that i. And i think a lot of people who have been radical. Choose to continue to be radical.

90
00:09:15,46 --> 00:09:17,07
And you know you see.

91
00:09:17,07 --> 00:09:18,43
And i'm not sixty or seventy yet

92
00:09:18,43 --> 00:09:28,18
but you know i hope on still fairly prepared to shine shit that i have this vision of may still be doing that ninety.

93
00:09:28,18 --> 00:09:32,4
Helpfully. And i have everybody kicks me along particularly the kids to do that.

94
00:09:32,4 --> 00:09:38,31
And so i think some people still radical. And i prepared to live a quiet.

95
00:09:38,31 --> 00:09:43,04
Difficult life at thomas because you have to keep making up the rules there are no appropriate role models anywhere.

96
00:09:43,04 --> 00:09:44,23
Nowhere in the world you know.

97
00:09:44,23 --> 00:09:50,04
From in russia is crumbled and it was never it never got to you know treat women equally or anything like that.

98
00:09:50,04 --> 00:09:55,23
So this is no way really that we see that as out there's not a role model school so we have to keep making it up.

99
00:09:55,23 --> 00:10:03,53
I have to keep making up had a parent much a night children in a way that i hope will be lead to us having a long long

100
00:10:03,53 --> 00:10:09,13
term loving relationship with each other and so we have to make it up.

101
00:10:09,13 --> 00:10:12,64
And i'm prepared to do that but it takes a lot of energy it takes a lot of time.

102
00:10:12,64 --> 00:10:17,24
And it takes a lot of research and reading and talking and actually my god you have to actually talk with people.

103
00:10:17,53 --> 00:10:22,19
These ideas you know. You can't take anything. As given right.

104
00:10:22,65 --> 00:10:28,63
And here sally and joan are giving a perfect example of sisterly brotherly love very advise thank you very much.

105
00:10:30,29 --> 00:10:37,1
And there are others if you get hit by this energy why if you will figure out how to her by sickly i mean it's not a

106
00:10:37,1 --> 00:10:39,74
conscious decision quite often. Of these people.

107
00:10:39,74 --> 00:10:42,65
And who basically have come from very conservative backgrounds

108
00:10:42,65 --> 00:10:47,74
and already does read of people's radical views have the reaction against conservatism.

109
00:10:47,97 --> 00:10:55,53
And by sickly it's easier just to follow the model that mom dad grandma grandpa whoever it is to see it. And a lot of.

110
00:10:55,53 --> 00:10:56,84
You know.

111
00:10:56,84 --> 00:11:02,43
Right in the steamed radical leaders of the time of sunk back even to what i would consider considered to be fairly

112
00:11:02,43 --> 00:11:10,46
conservative. Ways i mean i want to decide boring there but there's a real value judgment is in that you know.

113
00:11:10,46 --> 00:11:11,89
And i try not to be too.

114
00:11:11,89 --> 00:11:16,19
But it looks to me like these people are actually not particularly stimulated that's what i mean about boring.

115
00:11:16,19 --> 00:11:21,02
By same bored by same fairly i'm stimulated and same to spend a lot of time

116
00:11:21,02 --> 00:11:24,72
and energy trying to make life look very exciting doing.

117
00:11:24,72 --> 00:11:36,75
Essentially great time consuming but fairly unstimulating things. That said that radicals. Aviva been very radical.

118
00:11:36,75 --> 00:11:40,88
But maybe i don't know. I sometimes don't think i'm ready when other people say you.

119
00:11:40,88 --> 00:11:44,91
I don't know the answer to that i don't really care. I just hope i keep growing and changing.

120
00:11:44,91 --> 00:11:54,05
And i hope people boot me along the way to do it. You know. I'm still constructing new to constructing utopia.

121
00:11:54,05 --> 00:12:01,8
Oh i don't think i'd be as arrogant as to say that i know that life can be pleasant.

122
00:12:01,8 --> 00:12:04,77
I know that life can be fulfilling. Interesting.

123
00:12:04,77 --> 00:12:10,43
I know it can be surreal life can be surrounded by people who are loving. Stimulating interesting.

124
00:12:10,43 --> 00:12:15,09
I know the environment can be beautiful. I mean that's one of the other things that i've been.

125
00:12:15,09 --> 00:12:21,92
Passionately involved with and that's the. Protection of the environment. And it was a whole other area of space.

126
00:12:21,92 --> 00:12:26,04
So i think that. And i still. I'm not trying to create a utopia.

127
00:12:26,04 --> 00:12:32,23
I think utopia exists in a way i mean the world is beautiful. Humans a beautiful of a species a beautiful.

128
00:12:32,5 --> 00:12:39,17
Well we have to do is actually get away from our egocentric so it's. You know why and.

129
00:12:39,17 --> 00:12:46,5
Be generous and be willing to move. And let that shine around us really. I know that sounds.

130
00:12:46,5 --> 00:12:53,95
Not so that's why i'm here because the sightings like that's really cosmic. Far out man. You know it is i'm caught.

131
00:12:53,95 --> 00:12:59,89
I'm quite spiritual in that extent that extent. I always have been i think.

132
00:13:01,84 --> 00:13:06,66
And still since if you got to have a sense of humor i mean you know.

133
00:13:06,66 --> 00:13:11,68
I take myself very seriously you know i take myself very seriously i take my humor very seriously.

134
00:13:11,68 --> 00:13:12,53
There's a wonderful t.

135
00:13:12,53 --> 00:13:19,37
Shirt a friend of ours on the farm used to raid which real used to stew so many people in that city and the humorless.

136
00:13:19,37 --> 00:13:32,36
Him an ist. And i mean i just used to get such a chuckle a retard and that teisho. I know your story. And women.

137
00:13:47,76 --> 00:13:54,27
I mean what always because of course we're going to talk about home birth number seven. Jonah. All of a geek.

138
00:13:54,27 --> 00:13:55,51
Commonly known as bones.

139
00:13:55,51 --> 00:14:00,65
Because i can talk about that now look at my lovely daughters selam i can also talk about her book which was beautiful.

140
00:14:00,65 --> 00:14:11,49
Through. It's ok is it. As long as i have a little bit about your dressing and i will. I carry.

141
00:14:11,49 --> 00:14:18,86
I decided to have my second child for we decided to have a second child at seven john's dad and and i

142
00:14:18,86 --> 00:14:23,78
and we decided to have that child at home to have that the at home.

143
00:14:23,78 --> 00:14:31,63
And so we went about gaining support for that now i might add here that. I lived at that time.

144
00:14:31,63 --> 00:14:40,69
With people who were involved in the medical psychology. Social work professions. And so i went to pee. About it.

145
00:14:40,69 --> 00:14:45,44
It was a bit of a freak at the idea of having a baby at home and. I was very clear.

146
00:14:45,44 --> 00:14:51,34
Part of having a baby at home for me was about taking responsibility for myself and for my loss.

147
00:14:51,34 --> 00:14:53,7
And that's what a lot of a lot has been about.

148
00:14:53,7 --> 00:14:54,43
And that's why

149
00:14:54,43 --> 00:15:00,11
when it's been so wonderful cause i've had that opportunity to take responsibility for all aspects of my life.

150
00:15:00,11 --> 00:15:05,97
So i was prepared to take responsibility for the. Both of my second child. And by that i meant.

151
00:15:05,97 --> 00:15:18,67
I was prepared to make decisions around. How it would be. Who would be. What i'd do the usual. Fee is that any any.

152
00:15:18,67 --> 00:15:26,14
Pregnant woman goes through. And father is. You know what if the child is deformed or not normal. You know.

153
00:15:26,14 --> 00:15:29,83
But i sickly if it's if it's a deformed what will i do.

154
00:15:29,83 --> 00:15:33,58
And i was very clear about that i had gone through that with cells because i had my.

155
00:15:33,58 --> 00:15:41,02
The doctor who was my birth assistant and heard the made him promise that if. Much all.

156
00:15:41,02 --> 00:15:48,78
My firstborn child was born with. Obvious gross. Physical disability. That would require.

157
00:15:48,78 --> 00:15:54,15
Gross amounts of medical intervention. To continue to sustain the loss of that child.

158
00:15:54,15 --> 00:15:56,59
That he would promise he wouldn't take that medical intervention.

159
00:15:57,09 --> 00:16:02,78
Now you know he quoted hippocratic oath to mean all sorts of things but they all got him to do that. I mean you know.

160
00:16:02,78 --> 00:16:06,3
That was a very big seeing and it was a turning point in his career he said for me.

161
00:16:06,3 --> 00:16:12,19
For him to actually realize that it was not against the hippocratic oath to let women take responsibility for their

162
00:16:12,19 --> 00:16:17,94
birthing process to that extent. Ok so i was prepared to take those responsibilities and make those decisions.

163
00:16:17,94 --> 00:16:20,21
Around the birth of my second child.

164
00:16:20,91 --> 00:16:28,13
And on that very clear to our extended family members that died didn't feel responsibilities. That. As for example.

165
00:16:28,13 --> 00:16:35,76
The doctor in our household. Felt. Mark for his were all his due. So we went about having a baby at hand and.

166
00:16:35,76 --> 00:16:42,19
You know creating the nest getting. Carol. Stand on. Carolyn with. Norman stand. Dorothy smith.

167
00:16:42,19 --> 00:16:54,63
To be a support team actually midwife and support team. And we all went into the life. And john i was born.

168
00:16:54,63 --> 00:17:03,63
Was a beautiful who was foreman. Had calls an account beautiful woman in scope. Very well is one of the astrologers.

169
00:17:03,63 --> 00:17:12,11
And there were nine people to join us to sell of course was this i was twenty three months old nearly two at that town.

170
00:17:12,11 --> 00:17:18,54
And she had her loving. Abba mother beth with her as her support person.

171
00:17:18,54 --> 00:17:25,34
And we were excel option i was born at six thirty i had in the morning and. I went into live about twelve.

172
00:17:25,34 --> 00:17:32,32
That and not be who. And when it was obvious that the baby was coming soon sally was woken up and.

173
00:17:32,32 --> 00:17:40,32
There she was i want to say her brother brought into the world. She knew all about the. The physicality of intercourse.

174
00:17:40,32 --> 00:17:44,31
Birth and all the rest everything again you know. Knowledge is power. Or something like.

175
00:17:44,6 --> 00:17:50,61
She was totally aware of what was happening. She knew where jonah was going to come out and.

176
00:17:50,61 --> 00:17:54,64
The not be blood that might be water all of those things so i don't think she was particularly fice

177
00:17:54,64 --> 00:17:58,43
and insane to me that it. And you know i have this image of sally.

178
00:17:58,43 --> 00:18:07,56
In her little red dress again with the darkness down the front and being held lovingly by my. My sister beth.

179
00:18:08,89 --> 00:18:11,08
As john a kind into the world i'm in.

180
00:18:11,08 --> 00:18:16,89
And there were these nine people who fell in love with this baby as he literally popped that pretty little hand that

181
00:18:16,89 --> 00:18:18,39
grabbed carol's finger.

182
00:18:18,39 --> 00:18:23,46
And came into the world and then the rest of the family the rest of the fam came within minutes of his birth

183
00:18:23,46 --> 00:18:28,73
and talked around and. Lauriston. I mean what i want to say about that was that.

184
00:18:28,73 --> 00:18:33,8
It was just so wonderful the experience with sally had been sure to be in march this because i'd been in hospital.

185
00:18:33,8 --> 00:18:39,44
I had felt very isolated i was the only woman who was.

186
00:18:39,44 --> 00:18:43,74
Demand feeding her child in this hospital environment and i discovered this one other woman.

187
00:18:43,74 --> 00:18:45,56
Fortunately who'd had six children.

188
00:18:45,56 --> 00:18:50,36
And who actually taught me how to demand save much child in our blood had to demand food much of that is.

189
00:18:50,36 --> 00:18:54,19
You had to get in this is to bring the child to you when the child walk up and prod.

190
00:18:54,19 --> 00:18:58,21
Because we weren't allowed to have babies next to us during the not. That was a trauma for me.

191
00:18:58,21 --> 00:19:02,82
All i wanted was my baby next to me and i would be all right thank you very much.

192
00:19:02,82 --> 00:19:06,43
So the experience was that from that was i learned that i really want to be with me

193
00:19:06,43 --> 00:19:12,71
when i was born thanks after was born and so that's one of the reasons i chose to have it. John returned.

194
00:19:12,71 --> 00:19:18,48
And it was wonderful because a coyote gone to bed the not before i'd gone into lifeboat had a baby at six thirty eight

195
00:19:18,48 --> 00:19:22,09
in the morning. I got up afterwards and had a shower and run the family.

196
00:19:22,09 --> 00:19:26,32
In sydney at about eight o'clock and got this lovely little baby boy.

197
00:19:26,32 --> 00:19:30,77
And are gone back to rest him for the rest of the day but i wonder you know.

198
00:19:30,77 --> 00:19:35,79
When several of the goats and the cows in the trucks in the case in the docks. In the vegie garden.

199
00:19:35,79 --> 00:19:44,31
And i mean just same to me that was just a part of life instead of it being this great big no you. It was really.

200
00:19:44,76 --> 00:19:48,84
Very eventful. But my life. Went on as well very easily.

201
00:19:48,84 --> 00:19:55,14
I wasn't a strange hold with taken away from my daughter she was there she sort of sat there and held him

202
00:19:55,14 --> 00:20:01,11
and touched him and pushed and probably didn't try stiddy not remove. Cell putting a.

203
00:20:01,11 --> 00:20:04,74
What is a tie slot possible tie stephen fonda and she sort of you know i mean.

204
00:20:04,74 --> 00:20:10,44
That's not the sort of thing that can happen in a hospital and she tries very not assess it.

205
00:20:10,44 --> 00:20:16,16
Because i'm in our new diabetes delicious all of this this. This beautiful. Succulent little.

206
00:20:16,16 --> 00:20:24,62
New thing you know and so all of those things. We just felt like a continuation of my loss normally and. It was lovely.

207
00:20:24,62 --> 00:20:34,56
It was wonderful. And from that. I decided well aren't enough of these women. So we formed the beyond group.

208
00:20:34,56 --> 00:20:41,42
With food and i think just because you know that the time not have to look at the diets. Very much around.

209
00:20:41,42 --> 00:20:48,35
And so carol. Another's. Phone booth and beyond. And we decided we'd help as many families as we could.

210
00:20:48,35 --> 00:20:54,36
To have their babies. In the manner in which they said that if that meant. Supporting a woman to have a child.

211
00:20:54,36 --> 00:20:57,00
In hospital we do that if it meant.

212
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:00,86
Supporting a want through as much of her leibert higher than it being necessary for her to go to hospital

213
00:21:00,86 --> 00:21:06,7
or a big choice to go to hospital. Would do that if it meant. Choosing to have a diet have. We do that.

214
00:21:06,7 --> 00:21:13,94
So i started to listen. I mean we free schools. And you know that involves taking risks.

215
00:21:13,94 --> 00:21:19,00
And we're paid to do it and we had to negotiate with the medical profession in lismore cools to be.

216
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:24,55
Have them as our support people. When we didn't know what to do when we did encounter difficulties or difficult.

217
00:21:24,55 --> 00:21:26,73
Things like that and. We had to face.

218
00:21:26,86 --> 00:21:31,52
You know charges of irresponsible i don't think it's irresponsible to have you by be at home i think it's a very

219
00:21:31,52 --> 00:21:36,69
responsible act. So i was a guy it was one of those very powerful targets for me.

220
00:21:36,69 --> 00:21:41,5
And grew a lot through that experience. I loved helping women have their dieties of heart.

221
00:21:41,5 --> 00:21:45,11
It was a it was a real it's an honest. Be around.

222
00:21:45,11 --> 00:21:51,8
It's an honor to be around it and a lot of times i've moved towards helping friends towards their death. And it's been.

223
00:21:51,8 --> 00:21:56,81
You know it's reclaiming the routes to a less pics of our lives.

224
00:21:56,81 --> 00:22:00,92
It's reclaiming the right to have control over our lives. To provide shelter.

225
00:22:00,92 --> 00:22:10,54
To provide education to provide food to provide birthing and death in a way that we that we want to do it.

226
00:22:15,79 --> 00:22:19,75
How long was i mean than she i don't even lot putting use of it that.

227
00:22:19,75 --> 00:22:27,01
You know i was in the to some of the most formative years of my loss. And. And i'm grateful for the experience.

228
00:22:27,01 --> 00:22:27,97
I think they need.

229
00:22:27,97 --> 00:22:34,63
I think it was something like a live news i did didn't because you see i live communally in the city

230
00:22:34,63 --> 00:22:38,84
and it was all it's all part of the continuum is not where i'm on now.

231
00:22:38,84 --> 00:22:45,16
You know i may not live at the beach but i still see myself as part of an extended family. So i lived in him than.

232
00:22:45,16 --> 00:22:47,26
At the same sign community.

233
00:22:48,13 --> 00:22:54,47
When my partner charlie and i met and fell in love and we lived part time a tangible fals and part time

234
00:22:54,47 --> 00:22:58,4
and been trying to work out how we would negotiate.

235
00:22:58,4 --> 00:23:02,47
The physicality of that you know where would we have had on assault.

236
00:23:04,15 --> 00:23:13,96
But ninety i lived i stood at paradise but i'd never moved on from there to lift. And then. It was great.

237
00:23:13,96 --> 00:23:20,19
Ok so it was a live news. Short. That was you know half a lot tamanna something i don't know.

238
00:23:20,19 --> 00:23:26,1
And i don't really know how to put that into and sort of in woods because i'm just grateful for that experience and.

239
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:35,86
You know why i've never left him than. I are living. You know in a beautiful environment on the beach now and.

240
00:23:38,5 --> 00:23:44,31
But you know it's like. It's still part of it still. When i think of her and that's part of.

241
00:23:44,38 --> 00:23:50,29
My concept of time i mean i have very many when i think of hand. Many parts of the world in a y. Fit into that that.

242
00:23:50,29 --> 00:23:50,96
Image for me now

243
00:23:50,96 --> 00:23:56,91
and women certainly lads proud that i've still got lots of the friends they still have contact they have recently been

244
00:23:56,91 --> 00:24:04,07
involved in teaching a course to thing i just say. It's not. I mean i don't even think that you have to leave places.

245
00:24:04,07 --> 00:24:07,27
That's and that's part of what i think. I learnt.

246
00:24:07,27 --> 00:24:09,91
Living at nimbin is that you can have these connections and bonds

247
00:24:09,91 --> 00:24:17,66
and you don't even have to leave you just not there at the moment. So it's about how that attitude.

248
00:24:17,66 --> 00:24:23,59
Why did and why did on the why from in the not being a better way of putting that question.

249
00:24:23,59 --> 00:24:26,15
And that's that's a very long answer in a way.

250
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:34,99
It was after a long time of living in one place so i think i was really ready for a change.

251
00:24:34,99 --> 00:24:44,91
I become in our bodies more and more. Involved in women's education and. I think a lot of the issues.

252
00:24:44,91 --> 00:24:52,89
Of women's equality haven't been addressed. Or hadn't been addressed by. Most of the members of the community.

253
00:24:54,5 --> 00:25:00,6
One of the difficult issues that we went through. Issues of. Incest within the family.

254
00:25:00,6 --> 00:25:07,62
I didn't feel it as family adequately. Extended family adequately addressed those issues. To the satisfaction.

255
00:25:07,62 --> 00:25:16,57
And to the to the recovery of the young children involved. Young women involved. And i really you know that was.

256
00:25:16,57 --> 00:25:23,11
That was part of my i'd already moved to the coast. For work. Work was one of the reasons.

257
00:25:23,11 --> 00:25:26,92
Some of the issues about care of the environment. Was certainly involved.

258
00:25:26,92 --> 00:25:33,04
Some of the disagreements within the community about how we would actually kafer this very beautiful environment.

259
00:25:33,04 --> 00:25:37,92
And it wasn't that i was opposed. I think i was just.

260
00:25:37,92 --> 00:25:44,31
Because when i think in particular i think i was ready for china and i was ready to try to be in a situation where.

261
00:25:44,67 --> 00:25:47,1
Not going to be in a situation where i could have.

262
00:25:50,84 --> 00:25:57,13
Control of the some of the important choices i don't control in my negative why. More in the.

263
00:25:57,13 --> 00:26:05,04
Getting it passed by being responsible for your choices. I'm not saying this very well. It's a bit muddled.

264
00:26:05,04 --> 00:26:13,45
So i might have to rephrase some of this. Some of the reasons that i moved away from him than. Involved.

265
00:26:13,45 --> 00:26:19,93
Moving to a place where we could. But charlie and i i pull to thought when we found work more easily.

266
00:26:19,93 --> 00:26:22,73
With that long distance of travelling.

267
00:26:22,73 --> 00:26:29,52
I was really ready for a change i think after a long period of commitment to communal living. At paradise valley.

268
00:26:29,52 --> 00:26:35,25
I'm still love living communally in an extended family.

269
00:26:37,01 --> 00:26:42,94
I wanted to be able to be in a situation where some of the social issues that are really important to me were really

270
00:26:42,94 --> 00:26:48,53
being fully addressed within my own household. Some of those issues. And the issues of addiction.

271
00:26:48,79 --> 00:26:55,36
I really want to live in a drug free. Household for myself and for the kids. I want to live in and.

272
00:26:55,36 --> 00:27:01,64
You know a situation where people really a prepaid and bright enough to take on social issues like dealing with incest.

273
00:27:01,64 --> 00:27:10,23
Which wasn't adequately dealt with in my view. In the community and issues of the environment. I don't.

274
00:27:10,23 --> 00:27:17,02
I don't think we were able as a group. To come together very well and mike. Really significant. Radical.

275
00:27:17,86 --> 00:27:19,57
Decisions about care of the environment.

276
00:27:19,57 --> 00:27:23,82
And those with things that was what happening at the time that i was really ready to make my move and.

277
00:27:23,82 --> 00:27:28,52
As those issues became difficult i mean you asked whether some loss there was very difficult because it was difficult

278
00:27:28,52 --> 00:27:33,28
trying to not hold that up with you know many different people from different backgrounds and different audiologists.

279
00:27:33,28 --> 00:27:38,87
We didn't have any bonding audiology you didn't have to pass a test to come there.

280
00:27:38,87 --> 00:27:44,31
So is that i think that some of those issues were quite difficult and i was. I guess a little wearied of putting in.

281
00:27:44,48 --> 00:27:55,03
Such intense energy. Constantly on some of those issues. And education. Was one of the issues that.

282
00:27:55,03 --> 00:28:02,02
That was involved in mom. The kid's dad wasn't particularly satisfied with the notion of them.

283
00:28:02,02 --> 00:28:05,55
Continuing ha school sort of education at navan and such

284
00:28:05,55 --> 00:28:13,21
and i decided to be in a situation with the availability of hostels would be more acceptable to their dad and.

285
00:28:13,21 --> 00:28:16,53
You know to make life easier and easier for the kids home.

286
00:28:16,53 --> 00:28:22,75
So there were all these various issues that came into it and.

287
00:28:22,75 --> 00:28:25,85
One of the issues was that we were ready to travel with the kids.

288
00:28:25,85 --> 00:28:30,9
We promised the kids would take to what charlie promised the kids he'd take them to america and disneyland.

289
00:28:31,43 --> 00:28:36,00
Before celebrates twelve and sadly very sort of was a reminder charlie.

290
00:28:36,00 --> 00:28:40,74
Some twelve months old or two years before don't forget i'm nearly twelve and you have this promise.

291
00:28:40,74 --> 00:28:46,56
So we actually had to make sure that we could earn our income. Own and have income to to take this wild adventure.

292
00:28:46,56 --> 00:28:54,63
You know. Just heading off. Of the cities. So all of those. Influenced me.

293
00:28:54,63 --> 00:29:01,25
And you know i just i just saw my moving on from in the debate is being just another opportunity for me to grow in

294
00:29:01,25 --> 00:29:07,12
other ways. And to take a lot of the learning that i have learnt from him than into the broader community.

295
00:29:07,23 --> 00:29:12,84
I mean you know like we were looking after our environment through the forest campaign that i was very intimately

296
00:29:12,84 --> 00:29:15,23
involved with and things like that we were doing some of that we got the.

297
00:29:15,23 --> 00:29:22,63
We got the rainforest policy for new south wales established we got the multiple occupancy trying to in local

298
00:29:22,63 --> 00:29:27,25
government occur and things like that we disturb the schools. But here we were you know.

299
00:29:27,25 --> 00:29:27,77
Cross bar

300
00:29:27,77 --> 00:29:34,43
and by he's an environment still being ravaged so you know part of what i've done since being out here is to establish

301
00:29:34,43 --> 00:29:39,19
with others and environments into he and. You know things like that so you know.

302
00:29:39,19 --> 00:30:01,15
It's just an opportunity to to to go and expand somewhere else. Oh what a question.

303
00:30:01,15 --> 00:30:08,67
The question being what made the community ineffectual with dealing with child abuse. Had three arkell.

304
00:30:08,67 --> 00:30:15,74
Petry arkell of the life. You want me to repeat about what night it made it what.

305
00:30:15,74 --> 00:30:20,07
Why was the community ineffectual in dealing with child abuse within the community.

306
00:30:21,64 --> 00:30:24,55
I wish i really knew the answer to that. I cannot any.

307
00:30:25,21 --> 00:30:29,32
I'm still only guessing at some of that and it's very easy to make generalizations.

308
00:30:29,32 --> 00:30:34,93
I think one of the reasons the community wasn't effective in dealing with child abuse.

309
00:30:34,93 --> 00:30:42,31
Was that many of the men in the community. Most of the men in the community by sickly.

310
00:30:42,31 --> 00:30:47,72
Felt it was ok and really saddened to have to cite it.

311
00:30:48,13 --> 00:30:53,94
I don't think that very many men were prepared to look at their own sexuality their own objectification of women

312
00:30:53,94 --> 00:31:00,07
and children. And to come to group did make some growth steps through that.

313
00:31:00,07 --> 00:31:07,98
I think many of the men felt all year but all been a bit like that miss so. Therefore it must be ok.

314
00:31:08,61 --> 00:31:14,94
I don't think there were very many women who were brave enough to speak out against their partners although in product

315
00:31:14,94 --> 00:31:24,32
conversations with me many of the women would. When it came to. And confrontation situation in which it indeed was.

316
00:31:25,25 --> 00:31:29,04
Those women were too. Threatened about their relationships i think.

317
00:31:29,04 --> 00:31:33,98
And that's that's when we talked earlier about six of them within communities we didn't call it six season

318
00:31:33,98 --> 00:31:37,85
but i think that's a pretty appropriate word to use. I don't see the issues of success and.

319
00:31:37,85 --> 00:31:45,21
Have been dealt with in individual communities or the community at large. And i'm very saddened by that.

320
00:31:47,11 --> 00:31:49,56
I can only do that myself in a.
