1
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:22,84
Yeah right. Although all the hippie dem and all the the sort of. Drug drug culture and.

2
00:00:22,84 --> 00:00:29,02
And yuppies and all of that stuff lies over there from a personally which is ten kilometers to the east

3
00:00:29,02 --> 00:00:32,81
and nimbin for me has always been the sanctuary you know this.

4
00:00:32,81 --> 00:00:39,2
This place of abundance and plenitude where i learned how to look after the gardens.

5
00:00:39,2 --> 00:00:46,31
How to look after the horses had had to witness the weather coming over. Do all those country things and.

6
00:00:46,31 --> 00:00:51,71
You know probably. Above everything how to look after myself my family. You know.

7
00:00:51,71 --> 00:01:01,62
Without all the added stresses of of a full on occupational career or or. Traveling or cars or traffic or buildings or.

8
00:01:01,62 --> 00:01:09,7
Made your communications and all those sort of distorting and disturbing things you know. Taking in big doses. So.

9
00:01:09,7 --> 00:01:15,43
So what it is from a here is a natural. Basis for living.

10
00:01:15,43 --> 00:01:24,03
Which is beautiful enough not to have to be invited by by civilization.

11
00:01:24,03 --> 00:01:34,89
And that's what you say you know when you look out the window. It's what you can see out there. Well i think that.

12
00:01:34,89 --> 00:01:39,27
I spent time in the city and i thought. I spent long enough there to know what it was like.

13
00:01:39,27 --> 00:01:43,21
I went to two high schools there. During my high school career and you know.

14
00:01:43,21 --> 00:01:48,62
Growing up there my father lives down there now it's like down there. So. I mean. Thank god.

15
00:01:48,62 --> 00:01:52,83
When you've got the best of both worlds. You know you're lucky enough to sort of have. At the bit.

16
00:01:52,83 --> 00:02:00,12
You know what the city can offer and what the country can offer. But given the choice i think i always choose what.

17
00:02:00,12 --> 00:02:08,27
What you have up here. City's great but i think. Cities for. It just seems like such a fragile place. You know.

18
00:02:08,27 --> 00:02:13,27
It's a sort of. It's a whole system of its own that looks like it's on the verge of concern. You fall into.

19
00:02:13,94 --> 00:02:22,51
And i wonder if one day it will actually fall down. And all those people won't have anywhere to go. I think. Yeah.

20
00:02:22,51 --> 00:02:39,59
So this is where it's at me. My pleasure. What i'd like to offer is a conclusion. To all of this is that.

21
00:02:40,14 --> 00:02:50,31
I think the made and. In general interest amongst the strains. Elsewhere. Has been named a particularly.

22
00:02:50,31 --> 00:02:57,48
Confrontational strange or frightening place and i think what really is important for people to understand now is that.

23
00:02:57,48 --> 00:03:03,6
Is that name been easy integrating and is becoming much more.

24
00:03:03,6 --> 00:03:08,51
Much more ordinary than what would people would normally think and i think that's what's important about it.

25
00:03:08,51 --> 00:03:14,94
That it needn't be this unique or special or mystical or transcendent place at all which it isn't.

26
00:03:14,94 --> 00:03:33,06
But just be a beautiful haven. The people to come to when they want to. You know. Absolutely yeah. The.

27
00:03:33,06 --> 00:03:36,39
They've actually. And they've actually been able to blend so much.

28
00:03:36,39 --> 00:03:41,35
Into mainstream media an understanding in communications that year. Of our laps now.

29
00:03:41,35 --> 00:03:47,31
And i think the thing about newman as it's not. It's not going to perform that role too much in the future anymore.

30
00:03:47,63 --> 00:03:48,97
Sure it's got its perma culture hamlet

31
00:03:48,97 --> 00:03:56,04
and it's called her new energy systems which are very much to the logical developments but the whole. Ethical and.

32
00:03:56,04 --> 00:04:03,19
Spiritual and societal. Influence which newman has had is is not so much the issue anymore.

33
00:04:03,19 --> 00:04:14,71
And i don't think people should. Should have false expectations or that is. Sure. If not prefer.

34
00:04:14,71 --> 00:04:19,81
If not prophetical visionary it's. There's a stereotypical image of. Of out.

35
00:04:19,81 --> 00:04:24,45
Altered decadence or ultra self-indulgence alter. Ultra. Nihilism.

36
00:04:24,45 --> 00:04:28,69
You know existential angst sort of floating around the ice i'm sure that's true but.

37
00:04:28,69 --> 00:04:34,27
But isn't that the same everywhere. And this is not sort of nimbin just a reflection of any anywhere else.

38
00:04:34,27 --> 00:04:40,93
And i mean you can walk down any place in sydney and see a marker cosmo what nimbin is you know.

39
00:04:40,93 --> 00:04:48,42
Just you know been turned. So i think indians always held this. This sort of. Intriguing mysterious.

40
00:04:48,42 --> 00:04:51,58
Role in a strong society since the early seventies.

41
00:04:51,58 --> 00:04:57,82
And i think now it's time for people who are out there in living in in conservative.

42
00:04:57,82 --> 00:05:02,4
Suburban harms to realise that that the change is going to start happening from there.

43
00:05:02,4 --> 00:05:07,36
You know in humans all right but it is. It's going to sort of. Grab along in you know sort of.

44
00:05:07,36 --> 00:05:12,54
Happily develop into a scene obsolescence you know. While every. Everything else just keeps on blowing up.

45
00:05:12,54 --> 00:05:17,59
And i think that's important for for suburban people. For people who leave.

46
00:05:17,59 --> 00:05:21,82
Out there amongst amongst millions of other people to understand it.

47
00:05:21,82 --> 00:05:52,51
And that it's important to learn how to organize their lives in a more ethical and sound way. Ok..

48
00:05:35,35 --> 00:05:51,85
So for the fourth of december not you know speaking with gloria. Constantine can use c. O. N. S. T. I n. E. G.'s o.

49
00:05:52,51 --> 00:06:07,73
Well i'm gloria constantine. And i work at the name in news. That. I've been a name in about ten to eleven news.

50
00:06:08,95 --> 00:06:19,29
I visited nimbin for two years before that. Fast now. He said to pipe her. In melbourne. Before i came up here.

51
00:06:19,29 --> 00:06:30,19
So it was pretty irrelevant to get involved with a name in news which i did about. Oh between eight and nine years ago.

52
00:06:32,35 --> 00:06:51,33
Distilling. Different things. Into fears and what have you. Just. Now it's much bigger. The.

53
00:06:51,33 --> 00:06:55,35
That if is a train this pipe and the pipe i did before was that.

54
00:06:55,35 --> 00:07:00,29
There's also similarities and that is that they're all voluntary that. You don't get paid anything.

55
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:16,41
This is just bigger. It's more involved. Why do a wide range of topics. Yeah. You use. It's.

56
00:07:20,78 --> 00:07:28,14
Now let's see if i were reading it for the first time i suppose you'd get an overview

57
00:07:28,14 --> 00:07:38,14
or you get an insight into what's happening around nimbin. We get lots of letters coming in. Some of them.

58
00:07:38,14 --> 00:07:45,19
Criticizing different aspects of the society and. Where applies to that but.

59
00:07:45,19 --> 00:07:55,02
Just different letters have from different paper that gives a good idea of what's happening and. We also. We ate.

60
00:07:55,02 --> 00:08:02,3
Matou it out of other magazines that we swapped with so that the most up to date information is thought witty.

61
00:08:02,3 --> 00:08:09,92
I pay of. Nimbin if you know that way we had all the information you think's important. That paper should now.

62
00:08:09,92 --> 00:08:28,61
And get that in there. We want to educate people. Can you use those sources. Yeah i can do that.

63
00:08:28,61 --> 00:08:40,93
I can see the source is. Wow. We've got plenty of sources is social turn to to use can't use. China action.

64
00:08:40,93 --> 00:08:55,66
Coyote's ho from japan. Silver cold. Swan. The whole person and most agenda. Come via. Some of these a firm.

65
00:08:55,66 --> 00:09:10,16
I've a say soft technology. Bix. Grab. News letter. And i mean told if.

66
00:09:10,16 --> 00:09:20,85
Nexis garden oh you know i mean i mean we get them all and screw right. So much.

67
00:09:22,03 --> 00:09:29,86
Oh my oh i should you know ask in my oh. Today it's not all mind. You. And we get quite a bit.

68
00:09:29,86 --> 00:09:35,48
You get quite a bit of you know the end of month we get the magazines come in in the month place. We also get a lot of.

69
00:09:35,48 --> 00:09:43,37
We seem to be on somebodies list which i wish we weren't we getting all these media release of. Beauty products and.

70
00:09:43,37 --> 00:09:49,08
Pit sings in you know the stuff that we're really not interested in oh.

71
00:09:49,08 --> 00:09:53,79
You know they just send all of this stuff i mean there's even a brochure sent to them out which.

72
00:09:53,79 --> 00:09:57,85
You couldn't even undo the clasp. But.

73
00:09:57,85 --> 00:10:02,99
I just mean i really wish they would sort of tie his off the least and save a man a you know.

74
00:10:06,81 --> 00:10:14,52
Well we don't know who's put us on some list but obviously we're there and we can. The staff. We even had.

75
00:10:14,52 --> 00:10:20,45
Stuff from telecom which wasn't too bad i suppose but. You know i mean. We hear from them anyway.

76
00:10:20,45 --> 00:10:32,6
Time when they want their money. Now just resent being on a on a list of people they've got the impression that.

77
00:10:32,6 --> 00:10:39,00
That the stuff that they're sending in these is good in that you know they haven't noticed taken off it when.

78
00:10:39,00 --> 00:10:51,9
You know it just gets put seeing the unsolicited mail releases pile. And that's where it stays. Yeah.

79
00:10:51,9 --> 00:10:57,93
It's a real home and i. We were sending them back at first but. Didn't they still send them out.

80
00:10:57,93 --> 00:11:01,95
I mean we said we get some from. From them every week.

81
00:11:01,95 --> 00:11:09,2
Different people we get stuff every week you know it's incredible. It's not much of the stuff. We can.

82
00:11:09,2 --> 00:11:18,07
We can use it all. In fact very very little.

83
00:11:18,07 --> 00:11:26,36
And this is now it's an australian list obviously we're not getting stuff from elsewhere. You know.

84
00:11:26,36 --> 00:11:49,63
What's the sort of office in which. Use through. Topics. Well. We get lots and lots of power trade which he's great.

85
00:11:49,63 --> 00:12:01,24
Really nice way of expressing yourself and apparently can't get sued if it helps the forestry. Fost problems you know.

86
00:12:01,24 --> 00:12:09,51
The environment is a predominance you know you can assign ecology and you can move in with you know.

87
00:12:09,51 --> 00:12:14,67
Trying to find the best ways of doing things and it seems that. Why is it doing things.

88
00:12:14,67 --> 00:12:21,67
Information of the wife doing things that is not going to pollute the environment and. Send us to our destruction.

89
00:12:21,67 --> 00:12:26,48
Which i think is something that is affecting everybody even if i don't talk about it very much.

90
00:12:26,48 --> 00:12:30,48
He's still a sort of a depressing thought to think that you know.

91
00:12:30,48 --> 00:12:49,21
The world as we know it might not be involved for for the end of allaf time when that event the future or. Issues.

92
00:12:50,67 --> 00:13:03,86
Yeah this. There are very heavy deep rights. We. We just give people the opportunity to debate that. That in the paper.

93
00:13:04,99 --> 00:13:17,35
I think it is. These always a tendency that people don't mistry in themselves to the actual issue rather than.

94
00:13:17,35 --> 00:13:28,57
They tend to attack the person. Which he's you know. Not the best way to do things. The issue is is what's at stake.

95
00:13:28,57 --> 00:13:37,6
Not whether you put somebody down oh. Make somebody feel say. It's free press.

96
00:13:42,17 --> 00:13:46,74
Well it's not it's i mean we don't preach everything that comes in they some stuff that.

97
00:13:46,74 --> 00:13:51,8
We would gain some stuff from from a guy. Mr praying.

98
00:13:51,8 --> 00:13:58,69
Actually who went away was a god he was i would say somewhere south america.

99
00:13:58,69 --> 00:14:03,78
And was sending us stuff from there i mean the sin is copious amounts of stuff that we couldn't.

100
00:14:03,78 --> 00:14:12,41
We couldn't get any make any sense of. While he was in australia and when he went to south america he sent a small.

101
00:14:13,18 --> 00:14:24,62
But sore. Thoughts and i know you haven't seen them for a while and i think maybe the message.

102
00:14:24,62 --> 00:14:41,18
But he was attacking other people in these latest who. You know i got bit personal politics politics is about.

103
00:14:41,18 --> 00:14:50,95
The local politics of this. There's lots of different cliques and groups and people.

104
00:14:50,95 --> 00:14:58,29
Different ideas different i.d.'s one of the price. They knock of range from the super very cold.

105
00:14:58,29 --> 00:15:12,67
To they super strike if you like. Beyond us. But within that range is what newbies.

106
00:15:12,67 --> 00:15:26,66
There are quite like the most democratic market. And they can. And that. I think. And i kist stick. They work.

107
00:15:26,66 --> 00:15:37,96
They walk i say and i kissed a democracy yeah. I don't know that i could put the. Two words together but.

108
00:15:38,92 --> 00:15:45,49
It depends on how many am how much she can blab. Into home. You know.

109
00:15:45,49 --> 00:15:53,28
Who would listen to you as to how good you doing the point politico. Political stuff. You know.

110
00:15:53,28 --> 00:15:59,74
This is politics and policy exists dirty politics in these getting the message across

111
00:15:59,74 --> 00:16:15,92
and the dirty politics is the law isn't xed makes it worse would. Well exploited.

112
00:16:15,92 --> 00:16:27,92
Awake exploitation is exploiting the situation. But a situation can happen and lies and exaggerations. Become.

113
00:16:27,92 --> 00:16:35,25
What's heard and. If you don't have an opportunity to. You know.

114
00:16:35,25 --> 00:16:40,32
If you haven't got the time or the inclination to go blab blab blab and as much as what the opposition has.

115
00:16:40,98 --> 00:17:10,45
Then you've sunk. Sean he can't even write. Mr jones mr jones. You know the mrs jones of him. Well that was.

116
00:17:10,45 --> 00:17:15,85
That was pretty incredible. I had people come out to me in the street saying that traffic guy you know i said.

117
00:17:16,68 --> 00:17:22,25
He's a bit sas. And i mean i knew that but i mean.

118
00:17:22,25 --> 00:17:27,67
Strategy their policy was that you know if anybody wants to work on the name a nice thing. Come and want it.

119
00:17:27,67 --> 00:17:32,25
And he was willing to do some work and so he sort of can be.

120
00:17:32,25 --> 00:17:38,38
This was a time before we just as we would get in the mail box

121
00:17:38,38 --> 00:17:44,85
and mail box we were saving my all for this person before we were saving any amount for us.

122
00:17:44,85 --> 00:17:57,12
And he was he had great plans of doing or for the alternative press. You know tentative price it was going to be.

123
00:17:57,12 --> 00:18:09,84
And he was going to be. Gavin and it was going to get a c.p. Grant of half a million dollars. I had people.

124
00:18:09,84 --> 00:18:17,00
Cat in paper barely had a factory. Vented in this mall and had no sort of.

125
00:18:17,00 --> 00:18:24,57
Nothing really to back him up because there was on. Investigation there was no safe pain. Around him.

126
00:18:24,57 --> 00:18:35,2
Anyway then he got to me that registered the name in the news in his nine. And i mean.

127
00:18:35,2 --> 00:18:40,27
You know i should have images to jesus got about i mean nobody our didn't wasn't even aware that.

128
00:18:40,27 --> 00:18:45,63
You know registration had to happen even. You know what i think we're taking care of him.

129
00:18:45,63 --> 00:18:52,1
He found out that it wasn't me just didn't him i just did it in his name plus a rainbow news and.

130
00:18:52,1 --> 00:18:54,01
I tricked him into admitting it.

131
00:18:54,01 --> 00:19:00,11
I said you know how much it cost to buy just the name you mean using you and i'm not in your life.

132
00:19:00,11 --> 00:19:07,45
How much it cost to register and even use and. He said oh all. Member how much it was but one.

133
00:19:07,45 --> 00:19:14,23
What if it was sixty bucks. So now i whose name did you register in. He said oh my i thought i said.

134
00:19:14,23 --> 00:19:22,25
Did he lie down trick isn't it. Said you know i can't you know i done it in your and i i says well. That's business.

135
00:19:22,25 --> 00:19:29,6
That's business. It's the shadows the shouters and they are prized.

136
00:19:29,6 --> 00:19:36,54
So when he was holding to these nine was going to be mad from now on and that you better clear off from being used.

137
00:19:36,54 --> 00:19:52,38
He's kazin and bring his case in first and then feel off because he wouldn't be taken seriously anymore. And so.

138
00:19:52,38 --> 00:20:01,42
I actually. The first rainbow news that came out we were trying to sort of become financial.

139
00:20:01,42 --> 00:20:06,84
By bringing out a paper each month which was going to be alternately the vent name in news and rainbow news.

140
00:20:06,84 --> 00:20:09,42
For the first rainbow news that was the next one that was coming up

141
00:20:09,42 --> 00:20:17,88
and it couldn't wait for the following one which would be the name. So i sort of printed something about it. In there.

142
00:20:17,88 --> 00:20:30,15
But we eventually got the really news we just didn't and i'm after. And it will be it for five years.

143
00:20:30,15 --> 00:20:34,62
There's also mr jones he's out there. I don't think you want to show his face.

144
00:20:52,44 --> 00:21:03,23
What sort of structures that will use my. It's oval system. Oh yes it's still voluntary although we do have placings.

145
00:21:08,33 --> 00:21:17,28
Some of our advertising these. Swaps for. Virtues. That enable us to go and say in a restaurant or.

146
00:21:17,28 --> 00:21:22,71
Have a message of pictures or something that they're not very much i mean any.

147
00:21:22,71 --> 00:21:28,45
Very small amount but that just makes a little bit of icing on the cake for us you know apart from being at the pipe

148
00:21:28,45 --> 00:21:46,33
and we can do that and that's. Yeah. Hardly. But in. Stressful.

149
00:21:46,33 --> 00:21:51,35
I used to be stressful it's not anymore it's working really really well right now we've got a great group working

150
00:21:51,35 --> 00:22:00,3
together. The stuff that comes in even the stuff that. Skates chuy's net of the piper. So that it's.

151
00:22:00,3 --> 00:22:05,12
We try and take the power out of positions. If you like.

152
00:22:05,12 --> 00:22:11,56
We don't have an eighty turner sub eighty seven of this in there that. We just sort of do what we can.

153
00:22:11,56 --> 00:22:17,9
And what needs to. Down. And we get the piper out and. You know some of us get better at other things.

154
00:22:17,9 --> 00:22:25,65
You know certain things like you know i don't go near the computer. But other people are you know we spang.

155
00:22:25,65 --> 00:22:35,2
At the computer and stuff like that. Anyway i am. Stuff that comes in we put it up on the board and. Twenty three one.

156
00:22:35,2 --> 00:22:40,76
Say paypal voting for it to go and of hyper then it gets processed going to paper.

157
00:22:40,76 --> 00:22:43,51
They might be stuff they that might get.

158
00:22:43,51 --> 00:22:47,72
To runs into stories so you know if you put a story on it it means that you know not recommended.

159
00:22:48,79 --> 00:22:55,62
Well there's a two which means that. It's a possibility if this. You know if you start for filler. Which we wind up.

160
00:22:55,62 --> 00:23:01,28
Not usually. We've got so much stuff on the board you know that that could go in that.

161
00:23:01,28 --> 00:23:02,87
We don't really need feelers but.

162
00:23:02,87 --> 00:23:08,79
It may need to be eighty two or something may need to be down to it to make except of two going

163
00:23:08,79 --> 00:23:14,67
or it might be relevant to put it in you know a lot of that might be some kind of a fruit fly trap with some cheese.

164
00:23:14,67 --> 00:23:25,28
Silly put in in the winter when nobody's thinking at all about fruit flies. Yeah yeah yeah.

165
00:23:25,46 --> 00:23:35,72
And of course seeing the local stuff the letters and they stuffed of. The days. There's more emphasis on that is more.

166
00:23:35,72 --> 00:23:44,69
That has a higher priority than any. Reprinted stuff. And that goes in.

167
00:23:44,69 --> 00:23:52,88
And this is an objection to it we try and see everything before it goes in some time and we. There is such a lag.

168
00:23:52,88 --> 00:23:54,67
You know somebody is very slow to get it in

169
00:23:54,67 --> 00:23:59,03
and we don't even see it before it goes you know that's only happened once and there's been a problem with that.

170
00:23:59,03 --> 00:24:07,35
So i would like to be i would say in a safe make sure nobody's doing anything come down astley. In the writing.

171
00:24:07,35 --> 00:24:14,46
That can get ass and them into trouble. But it's you know it's unfair on acid. Staffs put in tonight.

172
00:24:14,46 --> 00:24:16,42
And we don't have a chance to process it

173
00:24:16,42 --> 00:24:28,03
but we've got the spice that we've you know we've got to get it to the printer. So was right. Oh yeah sure. Yeah.

174
00:24:28,03 --> 00:24:37,06
Well though some people prefer not to be applying just sort of black or black least anybody associated with the paper.

175
00:24:37,06 --> 00:24:45,42
I mean. I suppose it's you know. Maybe it's my paranoia. You know. Solutions from.

176
00:24:46,06 --> 00:24:48,95
Yeah yeah we've got subscriptions from live the place.

177
00:24:49,12 --> 00:24:57,23
We've got enough subscriptions i would probably not pushing it as much as we could. But we even got more one.

178
00:24:57,23 --> 00:25:05,93
Subscription from over say oh now two. Is alive if i v c's. And yeah we get subscriptions who know.

179
00:25:05,93 --> 00:25:13,51
We've just been working on our archives and we're getting. We're getting five together. Of. Total archives.

180
00:25:13,51 --> 00:25:20,17
Which he's an horrendous job. That. One of our work his name has been working on and.

181
00:25:20,17 --> 00:25:25,16
He's doing a magnificent job just saw him at these papers that we lugged around from place to place

182
00:25:25,16 --> 00:25:44,63
and all these boxes and boxes and boxes of paper. You know. All the offices. Well in the time not been made it. We've.

183
00:25:44,63 --> 00:25:49,15
We've been under the townhome and that was a real rummy price. It's like.

184
00:25:49,15 --> 00:25:56,95
I mean you wouldn't know his her wasn't an asset always very. Ganji is.

185
00:25:56,95 --> 00:26:01,66
There was you know there's a floor above us and if anybody want on the floors and.

186
00:26:01,66 --> 00:26:08,53
You get all the stuff coming through the sale you know it's horrible. Everything was covered in. Rot.

187
00:26:09,59 --> 00:26:23,88
I mean you know he clearly i mean and him. Oh i doubt that. And i i mean me i often think you know.

188
00:26:23,88 --> 00:26:28,69
I'm sure that somewhere in india there was something. Someplace worse.

189
00:26:29,27 --> 00:26:31,37
But i mean it was good to be able to be there

190
00:26:31,37 --> 00:26:37,51
and it was it was a start for us we didn't have any money we couldn't pay when we were in town which was very good.

191
00:26:37,51 --> 00:26:47,08
And. I mean my aversion to grow up he's not sort of necessarily. If you body's problem.

192
00:26:47,08 --> 00:26:56,51
And then we then we've entered a room from the community school which was really nice. Spent. That either i think.

193
00:26:56,51 --> 00:27:05,36
Maybe a little bit longer. And then i went to my pace china us. Then when i came back. Well.

194
00:27:05,36 --> 00:27:12,76
Picked up underneath the tomato sauce factory. Because the school needed they were. I had no way to die so they me.

195
00:27:12,76 --> 00:27:21,02
And he to get ahead has the band has a tenable folds and we.

196
00:27:22,1 --> 00:27:28,84
We moved in there and that was really good how he asked so i sailed it's amazing we've got the phone on while.

197
00:27:28,84 --> 00:27:37,37
I was really coming up in the world. And we go to a printing press. And op shop actually.

198
00:27:38,55 --> 00:27:47,16
I got this going he was an offset printing press and. Yeah we got that guy in and had that going for a while.

199
00:27:47,16 --> 00:27:56,65
It was pretty pretty hard work and set up the office and. You know just. Just tried it out why and to gain.

200
00:27:56,65 --> 00:28:03,22
Having a little bit of money in paying the bills and. But never anything. To pay the workers at all.

201
00:28:03,22 --> 00:28:14,07
And now we've got this. We would they have asked we know. Now six she's sick she's in the time. I said. Fasten.

202
00:28:14,07 --> 00:28:24,34
But sick she was we were there. And now we're in this office in town behind same's organic food shop and.

203
00:28:24,34 --> 00:28:33,46
He's great it's very hot in the summer that he's very compact we've got me and when i say. Organize i sell us and.

204
00:28:33,46 --> 00:28:36,4
Can have big furniture or anything and.

205
00:28:36,4 --> 00:28:51,9
They frankly functions in where we are so now we're managing to make it so that it works for us. Any problems.

206
00:28:51,9 --> 00:29:02,72
Structure. A secular structure. On a non hierarchical structure and yeah. I don't.

207
00:29:02,72 --> 00:29:19,04
Because now we all treat each other really well actually. Fishley this group is presently. Here taking a long while.

208
00:29:19,04 --> 00:29:24,18
But yeah. Talking past the padded positions. And that is that you know.

209
00:29:24,18 --> 00:29:29,57
The eighty thousand sort of police pushes wide and.

210
00:29:29,57 --> 00:29:35,12
On everybody else we all make decisions we have made things about things and. You know if we go to.

211
00:29:35,12 --> 00:29:39,03
Going to spend more than a hundred bucks we make a decision about it and.

212
00:29:39,03 --> 00:29:47,95
If we're going to make a change in the present strategy we make a decision about it. We don't sort of.

213
00:29:47,95 --> 00:29:54,41
People don't sort of assume that something's going to happen and then do it and drag everybody along these.

214
00:29:54,41 --> 00:29:59,69
Make decisions about it so you know what way going what you do and if you want to take part you do.

215
00:29:59,69 --> 00:30:16,71
And if you don't you don't see the you know they actually. Always been. It's going manny well it's financially.

216
00:30:16,71 --> 00:30:28,73
Spy and it's bills with went out to falter a fold. From leaving town of all. To come in here. But.

217
00:30:28,73 --> 00:30:35,62
We've organized wise of overcoming that. You know i mean. Increase in advertising and.

218
00:30:36,65 --> 00:30:40,58
Of course the advertising and mining count.

219
00:30:42,67 --> 00:30:51,22
Yeah we just make sure that you know that we get enough coming in to pay the bills. That there isn't this.

220
00:30:51,22 --> 00:31:00,99
And so i taking that step to actually be him financially as far as pie in paid was another matter that is nowhere near

221
00:31:00,99 --> 00:31:11,77
inside. Yeah. Everybody would like a. Yeah we know it's really good.

222
00:31:11,77 --> 00:31:18,91
It's good to be able to actually put your skills to some use. And.

223
00:31:18,91 --> 00:31:21,71
Produce something that is really good that people can actually in the street

224
00:31:21,71 --> 00:31:28,28
and say are not human use was really good at best yet you know the last six times that people have been the science of

225
00:31:28,28 --> 00:31:31,42
a stream. So it must be improving.
