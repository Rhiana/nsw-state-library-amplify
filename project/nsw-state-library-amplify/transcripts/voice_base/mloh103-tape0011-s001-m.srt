1
00:00:15,98 --> 00:00:38,11
So. Tweet yes. You know it. Just. Hello. I am. Terry mcgee and.

2
00:00:38,11 --> 00:00:51,12
I mean this name and story because i was a participant at the original. Aquarius festival. Who stayed on and.

3
00:00:51,12 --> 00:00:56,99
I came a few weeks before the festival. A friend of mine bob craven.

4
00:00:56,99 --> 00:01:07,41
And and others here working as part of the organization. And i came up did a bit of help in the architectural.

5
00:01:07,41 --> 00:01:19,08
Team before hand. And then this here for the festival. I suppose. The.

6
00:01:19,08 --> 00:01:26,36
My further relevance why i'm still sort of talking about it is because at the end of the festival.

7
00:01:26,36 --> 00:01:39,17
There was one workshop. Being chaired by richard neville. To discuss. Lyta. Communities being formed in the area.

8
00:01:39,17 --> 00:01:50,73
After the festival and. I was at the workshop. We talked for hours. Richard never invited one particular person.

9
00:01:50,73 --> 00:02:01,86
To organize some sort of. After the festival. Process and.

10
00:02:01,86 --> 00:02:11,8
I guess i had a feeling that that particular person was not going to be incredibly successful in doing it.

11
00:02:11,8 --> 00:02:20,48
And i simply set about with some discussion. With kenya emmons the son of the irrigation.

12
00:02:23,02 --> 00:02:39,31
I set about starting a tunnel force. Registering the cooperative. Arranging the deal on the land and then.

13
00:02:39,31 --> 00:02:45,44
Going through the process of trying to build up an organization that the cooperative

14
00:02:45,44 --> 00:02:59,3
when it was registered would be the legal part of it you hadn't come with an intention to stay i came up with the

15
00:02:59,3 --> 00:03:04,86
possibility i mean i didn't know i had i don't know why is thought about moving up to the north coast of new south

16
00:03:04,86 --> 00:03:12,15
wales. But i expected that. Any place that i would want to would be right on the coast.

17
00:03:14,24 --> 00:03:33,23
And so i hadn't expected to come up with to decide to do that so that was a challenge of my story writer.

18
00:03:33,23 --> 00:03:45,00
In one of the stories that. I was writing in. And still haven't finished at that. At that time was the story of. I.

19
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:59,35
And i lodge island where people were coming in from overseas. Almost in their dreams. To build new communities.

20
00:03:59,35 --> 00:04:09,33
To get away from various. All world problems. And so i just sort of automatic lee.

21
00:04:09,33 --> 00:04:14,79
Thought to myself of this was part of the. Graham.

22
00:04:14,98 --> 00:04:27,05
Ending of making that story a very real very detail being up to help on details of that story. I also thought that.

23
00:04:27,05 --> 00:04:36,06
Because of the festival. And some of the people that were here. That there was the spirit. In terms of.

24
00:04:36,06 --> 00:04:50,8
An artistic community. One that was interested in a lot of. A lot of thoughts a lot of new ideas and.

25
00:04:50,8 --> 00:04:57,5
That this might in fact be a better. Such place than one on the coast. That would get distracted by the.

26
00:04:57,5 --> 00:05:16,01
The joys of the beach. It was more the color. The background.

27
00:05:17,47 --> 00:05:25,24
It was almost like a movie that was a great movie but they forgot to put in part of the story.

28
00:05:25,9 --> 00:05:34,65
There was no connecting story. And i felt that. At the time. I felt that part of that reason was that.

29
00:05:34,65 --> 00:05:45,03
Because it had been centered on the town. Instead of. It. One of the other options before the festival.

30
00:05:45,03 --> 00:05:50,46
Was to try to arrange hannibal falls. The whole property as the festival site.

31
00:05:51,19 --> 00:05:54,76
And if that would have been the case then the festival. Would have.

32
00:05:54,76 --> 00:06:02,5
They would have been a story of the building of a new town. The creating the starting of a new town village.

33
00:06:02,66 --> 00:06:18,13
But because it was. Trains a tree in that sense of. The coming and going. It was almost. Describe the best way that i.

34
00:06:18,13 --> 00:06:19,99
I thought of late it was to talk.

35
00:06:19,99 --> 00:06:28,51
I had images of some songs and story of a guy was walking along the street of nim been. After the festival.

36
00:06:28,51 --> 00:06:30,26
And that he was.

37
00:06:30,26 --> 00:06:39,21
This little country town that had been so incredibly alive like a like thirty or forty thousand people really.

38
00:06:39,21 --> 00:06:42,71
Because all of it. Not that there were that many people but.

39
00:06:42,71 --> 00:06:55,28
All of its residents were very active they were going out and so you had this. Be artistic town.

40
00:06:55,28 --> 00:07:04,95
And then it was totally empty and. It was full of ghosts. Well it's sort of like the story that guys tell is.

41
00:07:04,95 --> 00:07:11,46
That's hard to actually capture on film. Because when you shoot it. You can't see the guys.

42
00:07:11,7 --> 00:07:23,23
And you can hear what they sign. But you see the color. I guess. The guys.

43
00:07:23,23 --> 00:07:34,69
But that they haven't made themselves particularly. More visible. They are they. I don't think that.

44
00:07:34,69 --> 00:07:49,94
It's the town itself has moved a huge distance from its potential. Its potential is.

45
00:07:49,94 --> 00:07:58,1
Are something where there is an artistic economic life. That requires a town.

46
00:07:59,62 --> 00:08:14,11
There's not that level of of really solid artistic business. That is being done. To justify its existence as.

47
00:08:14,11 --> 00:08:16,12
It's exists. And says the townies.

48
00:08:16,12 --> 00:08:23,63
Is a story call that there was a town there that was empty and was not being used very much. Because all of its.

49
00:08:23,63 --> 00:08:31,3
Not all but one half of its residents were pensioners and so they were just enjoying this beautiful little tan

50
00:08:31,3 --> 00:08:40,65
but it wasn't. It wasn't doing much. It wasn't very alive it wasn't doing a lot of business and.

51
00:08:40,65 --> 00:08:47,62
The things that could have occurred during the festival. Or straight after the festival.

52
00:08:47,62 --> 00:08:53,94
Didn't occur and haven't occurred yet. Even with all this business activity.

53
00:08:53,94 --> 00:08:58,11
You know new shops at ning in town at the moment that i. And they.

54
00:08:58,11 --> 00:09:07,16
They're not touching anything like the potential for a true arts center. Alternative out center.

55
00:09:07,16 --> 00:09:12,32
Alternative arts capital of astride whatever. You can go. And choose lots of.

56
00:09:12,32 --> 00:09:20,38
Sort of ways to describe most likely at the moment byron bay is more of an art center and. In this mall than.

57
00:09:20,38 --> 00:09:37,11
The name and. Anyway. I think it's more the. The whole way cannot make the whole way konami. Superstructure the whole.

58
00:09:37,11 --> 00:09:47,93
Sense of taking. Taking taking the business side of it all seriously. I guess it's.

59
00:09:47,93 --> 00:09:55,75
In many ways you get the feeling of people running around making a movie but the movie never gets made. Well.

60
00:09:55,75 --> 00:10:03,01
The other. Classic example is the town of all fours whole. It's been under constricts a beautiful structure.

61
00:10:03,01 --> 00:10:05,83
And it's a really beautiful. Really elegant.

62
00:10:05,83 --> 00:10:14,79
Really nicely designed but it's been under construction for sixteen years now. Something like sixteen years. Where.

63
00:10:14,89 --> 00:10:24,71
As i say bill and cliffs. There's been quite a beautiful. New crafts. Build. In three months.

64
00:10:25,02 --> 00:10:34,46
And it's completed its opening next weekend. And that sort of frustration. At this beautiful hole.

65
00:10:34,46 --> 00:10:45,39
That is is quite stunning in is the sort of classic game gradients. For a very artistic. But business. Real.

66
00:10:45,39 --> 00:10:53,5
Artistic as in. That makes money. Is this whole that would be beautiful.

67
00:10:53,5 --> 00:11:10,39
Part of that is incomplete after fifteen years. It's going the way. I think it's. The different parts of life.

68
00:11:10,39 --> 00:11:21,15
That the communities being able to face up to one. Two whole aspects very very well brilliantly.

69
00:11:21,3 --> 00:11:33,37
But haven't gone beyond those and i organized why. If you look at. The whole. If you look at the.

70
00:11:34,08 --> 00:11:43,6
The development of a community from scratch. Such as at a tunnel before us. And really you can treat the whole of the.

71
00:11:43,6 --> 00:11:54,96
Newman valley in that way because the number of people in houses and other things for people to do other than.

72
00:11:54,96 --> 00:12:05,5
Milk cows. The level of that. In this valley twenty years ago was a fairly low level. There wasn't a huge amount of.

73
00:12:05,5 --> 00:12:22,96
Of this. Develop space. And ton of all. When it started. Got pretty straight into. Two thoughts. Namely of.

74
00:12:22,96 --> 00:12:34,97
Building houses and growing fruit trees and. Reafforestation. Now. At that level. Ton of boys worked brilliantly.

75
00:12:36,75 --> 00:12:46,63
There's a huge number of. Really beautiful houses. Very laid back into the environment. Very. Non-intrusive.

76
00:12:47,93 --> 00:12:54,39
A lot of really good fruit trees and other trees. There throughout the whole property they regressed.

77
00:12:54,39 --> 00:13:03,11
Down in the valley. Has been really beautiful and the. Why the. There are so many trees and.

78
00:13:03,11 --> 00:13:12,67
The orchards have broken up. Has really minimized. Insect problems. But then.

79
00:13:12,67 --> 00:13:20,12
Be you know on those two aspects of the whole tree. Agricultural. And the housing.

80
00:13:20,12 --> 00:13:30,56
The whole other levels of mechanical. Economics and post mechanical economics. Have. I have.

81
00:13:30,56 --> 00:13:35,58
I'm leaving at early stage. And there's being i.

82
00:13:35,58 --> 00:13:44,2
A really strong argument against them being dealt with at a community level.

83
00:13:44,2 --> 00:13:53,72
In the early days of town of a force there was a strong desire. A lot of people. To limit. Tolerable for was.

84
00:13:53,72 --> 00:14:04,71
And its activities. To housing and tree. Goblins and.

85
00:14:04,71 --> 00:14:14,79
That sort of kept on and i've ever written throughout the whole valley this lodge fear of development which. Amongst.

86
00:14:15,13 --> 00:14:21,25
Not everyone. Maybe not amongst the majority. But certainly amongst a very strong.

87
00:14:21,25 --> 00:14:31,15
Number of people and they feel it very strongly and i try to put a whole inference of badness. Against any.

88
00:14:31,15 --> 00:14:44,97
Economic activity that is not. At their sky. And that ends up with a real real difficulty a real. A hard press.

89
00:14:47,44 --> 00:14:53,67
I suppose you could say it just puts anyone who's trying to. Do things that are not.

90
00:14:53,67 --> 00:15:00,21
Has building or a tree god nor in titan. That i major disadvantage.

91
00:15:00,21 --> 00:15:19,98
Where they have to carry a lot of extra trouble a lot of extra white in order to do the same job which. Yes it's it's.

92
00:15:19,98 --> 00:15:35,92
One of the one of the aspects of why this is it's been difficult to get a community level playing on on economics.

93
00:15:35,92 --> 00:15:43,62
Beyond the house and gardens. As being. Part of the origins of the festival itself.

94
00:15:44,47 --> 00:15:54,87
And in the same many people coming up. And being part of the festival. Who had i vietnam protest. Our entire nation.

95
00:15:54,87 --> 00:16:04,18
Before they came. And when you're dealing with protests vietnam classic example.

96
00:16:04,18 --> 00:16:10,98
The key thing that you're always centering on. Is saying no. You are constantly.

97
00:16:11,93 --> 00:16:19,63
Coming up with a million brilliant arguments. And a million. Brilliant. Why is all.

98
00:16:19,63 --> 00:16:26,01
The saying no trying to stop things. And in fact of course. When the terrain year.

99
00:16:26,88 --> 00:16:37,12
Issue blew up up here to that end of a tad completely. Into the ecological question. Of saying no.

100
00:16:37,12 --> 00:16:43,38
And concentrating on stopping things. Of learning how to stop things. Of spending.

101
00:16:43,38 --> 00:16:55,67
Investing your life safe it in learning how to say no and to stop things. As i model. Good. Not only.

102
00:16:55,67 --> 00:17:06,92
Learning it as a skill. But actually investing it with. That is the moral good thing. And anyone who is not doing.

103
00:17:06,92 --> 00:17:16,48
Learning and specializing in having to say no is doing something bad. And that.

104
00:17:16,48 --> 00:17:26,56
That's being there in russia right now for a huge amount of the years we. We had a lot of debates. In niman.

105
00:17:26,56 --> 00:17:35,66
Where graham dunstan. And some other people were trying to argue that. We had to keep the whole of the valley.

106
00:17:35,66 --> 00:17:42,76
Only working on spontaneous structures. And i argued the case that it had to be on.

107
00:17:42,76 --> 00:17:51,32
Ongoing structures that had the capacity for spontaneity. As distinct from. Demanding that the.

108
00:17:51,32 --> 00:17:57,62
Structures be spontaneous structures. The reality is that.

109
00:17:57,62 --> 00:18:05,37
For structures that are going to say no that are going to oppose things. You only need a spontaneous structure.

110
00:18:05,8 --> 00:18:11,44
However grand dunstan's now come back to town wanting to do a twenty year festival next year.

111
00:18:11,44 --> 00:18:24,93
And he's really frustrated that there's no. Ongoing structure. It's capable of helping him do that it's. It's the.

112
00:18:24,93 --> 00:18:30,15
It just runs with the philosophy that if people. Practice at saying no too often.

113
00:18:30,15 --> 00:18:40,59
They in fact find it difficult to understand how difficult it is to get new things occurring. To write a play.

114
00:18:40,59 --> 00:18:49,44
To put on a play to do a musical. To start a business. To do a musical is to start a business. You can't.

115
00:18:49,44 --> 00:18:54,35
The number of people that you're going to involve the amount of time that you're going to ask of them.

116
00:18:55,59 --> 00:19:03,5
The amount of extra. Materials and resources that you're going to need. It is equal to a small business.

117
00:19:03,97 --> 00:19:08,37
And i suppose i've always had some level of our entire nation.

118
00:19:08,37 --> 00:19:24,29
Of that i've had difficulty getting something that does not exist. To actually exist. So. That's the challenge.

119
00:19:25,34 --> 00:19:46,17
Stop is right. Next. Role race. Beyond. Beyond their houses and three gardens. Getting other things to occur.

120
00:19:47,73 --> 00:19:49,17
Requires a an orientation.

121
00:19:49,25 --> 00:20:01,57
That means that they have to actually get themself and other people to agree on how to do things together. All.

122
00:20:01,57 --> 00:20:11,51
Business or. Things that require. Twenty thirty people tend to work together. Involve. Business transactions.

123
00:20:11,51 --> 00:20:17,66
Whether it's running a preschool or whatever. You have to get and then. People agreeing. Saying yes.

124
00:20:17,66 --> 00:20:24,65
To putting in a lot of effort. In order to get a whole range of things coordinated together.

125
00:20:25,66 --> 00:20:34,4
And that our intention is i suppose. Something that. Has taken a fair wall in him and.

126
00:20:34,4 --> 00:20:44,77
We early on a timetable for was gave up the idea of trying to get a lot of houses built by building in it for instance.

127
00:20:45,3 --> 00:20:49,69
That's one of the possibilities we could have looked at. But it.

128
00:20:49,69 --> 00:20:53,46
We weren't going to be have to agree on many of the details.

129
00:20:53,46 --> 00:20:58,81
And so it was going to be a lot easier for people to go out and build their own houses.

130
00:20:58,81 --> 00:21:06,66
And in fact that has had the major advantage of their being an incredibly low mortgage debt level.

131
00:21:09,44 --> 00:21:18,67
But it also has meant that. That. Part of the of the economy. Of past building. That has not existed.

132
00:21:20,2 --> 00:21:26,81
And if you look at a stride in. National statistics you see that the building industry the home building industry.

133
00:21:26,81 --> 00:21:34,9
Is a large percentage of the of a whole economy. Well in nimbin that part of the economy.

134
00:21:34,9 --> 00:21:42,91
Has only been one quarter of the size for this father per head of population and it's only been a quarter of the size.

135
00:21:42,91 --> 00:21:51,95
Because of people. Building their own. That means that the whole whether. Economics of the area. Are also slowed down.

136
00:21:52,25 --> 00:22:01,52
And it also means that all of those people that would normally have experience in doing business. Building houses.

137
00:22:01,52 --> 00:22:06,8
Have not had that experience. So it's really.

138
00:22:06,8 --> 00:22:14,79
I still think the easiest way for newman in the future would be to take it on consciously and i met. Learning how.

139
00:22:15,06 --> 00:22:21,99
To create businesses consciously. And i mean. In a fairly open.

140
00:22:21,99 --> 00:22:29,47
Information system where people throughout the whole community can know what the business is doing in economic terms.

141
00:22:29,47 --> 00:22:36,81
And how. And seeing the actual business is growing. You know overall turnover.

142
00:22:36,81 --> 00:22:42,23
And seeing how much more they're producing. So that then the whole community.

143
00:22:42,23 --> 00:22:51,96
Could have a sense of a level of economic growth and could actually have its own figures and to cystic so.

144
00:22:51,96 --> 00:23:00,45
I think it comes down to a question where you remain poor. If you think your poor.

145
00:23:00,45 --> 00:23:08,64
And if you start to decide that you're not really very poor. And you can actually justify what you're doing.

146
00:23:09,38 --> 00:23:21,72
Then you can change your. Economic status from poor. To. Well off. Simply from a change of attitude.

147
00:23:21,72 --> 00:23:34,98
You talk about these things and you know writing. This is that. Yeah but you know when it when it's close.

148
00:23:34,98 --> 00:23:37,59
Now i don't think it should make itself out of the system.

149
00:23:37,59 --> 00:23:47,96
But i think it should stop pretending that the system doesn't exist. Except when it wants something off. I mean.

150
00:23:47,96 --> 00:23:52,73
The fact that new guinea exists. Or indonesia exists.

151
00:23:52,94 --> 00:23:56,87
If you recognise it exists it doesn't mean that you have to be part of it.

152
00:23:56,87 --> 00:24:06,3
But you do have to recognise its legitimacy in its own place. And you have to be able to compare yourself against it.

153
00:24:06,3 --> 00:24:14,79
And likewise newman. Could have its own currency. But that currency would have to be real. Against this.

154
00:24:16,2 --> 00:24:22,1
You can have it's own economy. But that economy has to be real. Against the australian economy.

155
00:24:23,39 --> 00:24:34,62
And i just read the other day that decca. In bangladesh has won six sixteen percent. One six. Of its total economic.

156
00:24:34,62 --> 00:24:45,00
Work. Is on rickshaws. And i don't call them rituals. But they're the whole the whole wheeling. Of people.

157
00:24:45,00 --> 00:24:56,24
By human effort. On the back of. Two wheeled cots. Is one sixth of the total workforce. Of doctors job.

158
00:24:56,24 --> 00:25:04,58
Either in building them repairing them or doing the wheeling. Now that's. Economically real inside dhaka.

159
00:25:04,76 --> 00:25:15,74
But it's not a very wise use of life. And likewise in him and. The question. You don't have to be.

160
00:25:15,74 --> 00:25:17,1
Be part of the system.

161
00:25:17,1 --> 00:25:24,16
You know order to realise that economics does actually exist and even if no one talks about it then.

162
00:25:24,16 --> 00:25:28,81
Every day of the week a certain number of people are going to be building some houses.

163
00:25:28,81 --> 00:25:33,52
And some other people are going to be doing this and some people are going to be doing that.

164
00:25:33,52 --> 00:25:38,29
Main event to go to a limited number of people in any one valley.

165
00:25:38,29 --> 00:25:45,47
And they are only going to do a certain amount of work. Each week. And some will do more and that.

166
00:25:45,47 --> 00:25:49,5
That america can lift and drop. Depending on how they feel.

167
00:25:49,5 --> 00:25:57,19
But as soon as you start talking about what people are doing and where the people. Getting themselves.

168
00:25:57,19 --> 00:26:12,4
Poorer or richer. Then you're talking about economics. He's probably right. He's lost. I think it means. Well.

169
00:26:12,4 --> 00:26:19,55
All things. Do. Night. Time and then.

170
00:26:19,55 --> 00:26:29,93
Like this there's not a lot of ways in which i see now except if you look at include one xtra factor in there.

171
00:26:29,93 --> 00:26:35,76
Of whether they feel that they are poor or. Well off.

172
00:26:37,09 --> 00:26:44,93
When you look at at time before was that some really interesting examples and comparisons that you can make.

173
00:26:46,3 --> 00:26:56,6
And one of the factors a value that i think you have to take into it is. Is i person free to move.

174
00:26:57,3 --> 00:27:05,83
It's all very well to have a beautiful house and. Lots of really beautiful things about the place.

175
00:27:06,15 --> 00:27:12,38
That's the environment. It's spectacular. And the life star can be very enjoyable.

176
00:27:12,38 --> 00:27:24,34
If you think you got the right to leave. Even heaven. Can be a terrible place if you feel trapped there. Now.

177
00:27:24,34 --> 00:27:38,78
With tangible. There is. Because of the head space. There is i. Poverty. A poverty. That holds.

178
00:27:38,78 --> 00:27:44,53
People in there when they may not want to be there. The comparison is really easy.

179
00:27:44,53 --> 00:27:52,04
And with another place in the district court bill includes. Which was started ten years after kind of a force.

180
00:27:52,04 --> 00:28:06,16
It just had its tenth year anniversary a few weeks ago. And that bill includes which is the second biggest. Community.

181
00:28:06,16 --> 00:28:14,79
Around here after town of all force. People who joined it. Ten years ago the first people. Paid for the.

182
00:28:14,93 --> 00:28:25,34
And dollars for a share. And i think it runs from four up to about i. Nine thousand people now.

183
00:28:25,34 --> 00:28:36,97
The minimum amount that. If they wish to leave their empty block of land. Is now worth twenty two thousand dollars.

184
00:28:36,97 --> 00:28:47,14
Empty. And that's the minimum. So they're. For the for what they've put in.

185
00:28:47,14 --> 00:28:53,89
And i don't feel trapped in in the sense that they have to stay there because they can't afford to go anywhere else.

186
00:28:54,66 --> 00:29:07,19
Whereas at the same time. I know of one situation. A friend of mine. Where he if he sold his house and land.

187
00:29:07,19 --> 00:29:17,26
A town of will force. He would only be getting something in the twenty's. With a house as well.

188
00:29:17,26 --> 00:29:27,63
There's no in fact that the house of his house that town of always family beautiful. Then. Lots of thing.

189
00:29:27,63 --> 00:29:37,55
Places a bill in place. But because of the structure. And the head spice. Town of all fours thinks it's paul.

190
00:29:39,3 --> 00:29:47,5
And therefore. People who are thinking of coming in are only willing to pay. Small amounts of money.

191
00:29:47,87 --> 00:29:55,48
Now that means that someone who is there a ton of will. It's not actually worth their while to sell.

192
00:29:55,48 --> 00:30:02,55
Because for whatever good. They won't be i've got a very far in terms of any other house. If i sell out. B.

193
00:30:02,55 --> 00:30:08,94
I have to use the money just for. Living in the period of time before they have anything else.

194
00:30:09,69 --> 00:30:14,79
That means of us and isn't free to move. Now what's the whole lesson.

195
00:30:14,99 --> 00:30:25,13
That's been going on out of the east europe and russia. But the people felt that they weren't free to move. And now.

196
00:30:25,13 --> 00:30:27,08
If they try to move.

197
00:30:27,35 --> 00:30:30,83
They're not free to move either because germany and france

198
00:30:30,83 --> 00:30:35,75
and all those countries know how many people would like to move at least for economic reasons.

199
00:30:36,02 --> 00:30:39,84
And they don't want that many slaves coming into western europe.

200
00:30:40,86 --> 00:30:47,69
But the sense of being not freedom of is not just a question of physical restrictions.

201
00:30:47,69 --> 00:31:09,65
It's also largely an economic question. If you're you know. Not having them. Yes. And. Not having learnt. You know.

202
00:31:09,65 --> 00:31:19,84
Yeah yeah i realize what you. I suppose part of that. Poverty headspace.

203
00:31:19,84 --> 00:31:30,88
Is a whole suggestion that money is inherently evil that. Wiring about it or. Making it or getting it.
