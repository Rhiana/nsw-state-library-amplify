1
00:00:13,8 --> 00:00:19,55
I think the main reason. In retrospect the main reason for leaving the city and coming.

2
00:00:19,55 --> 00:00:24,45
Coming to nimbin and billington and such places was. Was really to live their own lives.

3
00:00:24,99 --> 00:00:29,67
I think that's that's the fundamental part of it. But the. It became.

4
00:00:29,67 --> 00:00:33,49
It was becoming increasingly and strongly obvious.

5
00:00:33,49 --> 00:00:39,45
Living in the city living the lives that our parents' generation set up. Which included.

6
00:00:39,45 --> 00:00:46,46
Sending is trying to send us to fight a war in vietnam that we fundamentally didn't believe in and. And and.

7
00:00:46,46 --> 00:00:52,61
Becoming more and more involved in a society totally dependent on oil and.

8
00:00:52,61 --> 00:00:58,08
Resources which couldn't be sustained at the level that we were using them.

9
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:03,7
And while they were particular things wrong with. That that way of living.

10
00:01:04,7 --> 00:01:09,82
I think now that the most important thing was that we wanted to have a life of their own

11
00:01:09,82 --> 00:01:14,76
and i really strongly think that every generation should do that.

12
00:01:14,76 --> 00:01:19,52
So that when we came up here and we tried new forms of relationship and new forms of family

13
00:01:19,52 --> 00:01:29,04
and new patterns of responsibility for children and new ways of living communally and. New forms of property ownership.

14
00:01:29,04 --> 00:01:36,23
Communal property ownership and so on and. Some of those of. Just become part of the mainstream.

15
00:01:36,23 --> 00:01:38,07
And some of them of being dropped altogether.

16
00:01:38,83 --> 00:01:45,83
Now many of us like to have private property allow there are still some very successful.

17
00:01:45,83 --> 00:01:48,08
Communal properties around and these are increasing

18
00:01:48,08 --> 00:01:53,98
but now they tend to be what are called multiple occupancies where it's almost a strata title system where everyone has

19
00:01:53,98 --> 00:02:01,74
the. Small block of land with a house on it and this communal ownership of one hundred acres or so of forest.

20
00:02:01,74 --> 00:02:03,35
In the middle so it's a.

21
00:02:03,35 --> 00:02:09,2
It's a nice combination i think of both and it's worthwhile to find out what are the things which.

22
00:02:09,2 --> 00:02:13,57
Which people really need how much private property how much.

23
00:02:13,95 --> 00:02:21,33
Lucidity of relationships and continuity of relationships that people need. I think when we came from the city we.

24
00:02:21,33 --> 00:02:25,1
We came out of a system which was far too repressive.

25
00:02:25,1 --> 00:02:29,31
And as revolutionary movements we went to the opposite extreme

26
00:02:29,31 --> 00:02:36,7
and there were those of us in that generation probably coming back and finding some middle ground which suits us.

27
00:02:37,26 --> 00:02:44,42
Hopefully the next generation will take off from a middle ground and then find a ground that suits them.

28
00:02:44,42 --> 00:02:53,36
So that the fact that now we don't all live communally and we don't all. Continue to share each other's. Partners and.

29
00:02:53,36 --> 00:02:59,33
That some of us are in monogamous relationships i don't think is in the sense of failure it was. It was worthwhile.

30
00:02:59,33 --> 00:03:08,23
Testing it. Changing. To whatever extent we needed to and. Finding out for selves what. What worked for us.

31
00:03:12,54 --> 00:03:18,05
That's a good thing to find out. That's a much better thing to find out than to have simply passed on to you.

32
00:03:29,26 --> 00:03:36,35
Fundus memories of newman would have to be. The healing festivals in the music. Just the.

33
00:03:36,35 --> 00:03:45,9
Probably my very fondest memory is being shampooed. By three or four people. Six or eight people.

34
00:03:45,9 --> 00:03:55,12
All singing and chanting. Delightfully. No single personal vibes just just.

35
00:03:55,12 --> 00:04:04,22
Bodily being part of a group of people in that way. The color. The color of people's dress. Costume you michael.

36
00:04:04,22 --> 00:04:07,79
And just the continual music that was made by us.

37
00:04:07,79 --> 00:04:13,23
And really the notion that we were doing all this we're having this marvelous magic creative. Interesting.

38
00:04:13,23 --> 00:04:19,27
In a generic lifestyle and it was only. We who were doing it. And i think that's the real.

39
00:04:20,29 --> 00:04:24,34
That really came from the concept the original concept of aquarius.

40
00:04:24,34 --> 00:04:30,17
And that grand danson and johnny out on set up is that the festival was to be just.

41
00:04:30,17 --> 00:04:35,93
To come from the energy and what people did the. It wasn't as festivals are now on.

42
00:04:35,93 --> 00:04:42,64
Or even woodstock was paid bands coming from somewhere else to entertain a group of.

43
00:04:42,64 --> 00:04:46,26
Consuming masses because that's the last hour we want to leave in the city.

44
00:04:46,26 --> 00:04:49,62
It's boring to be in the audience and consuming all the time.

45
00:04:49,62 --> 00:04:55,8
And it's wonderful to to have adventures and to do it yourself and you can. I've seen.

46
00:04:56,58 --> 00:05:01,2
I've had probably the best experiences and heard the bass music in my life.

47
00:05:03,1 --> 00:05:10,81
And of course a good circle gets going where that sort of energy attracts people who have studied many years

48
00:05:10,81 --> 00:05:17,9
and have developed a real skills in music and art and drama and so on and those people would then.

49
00:05:17,9 --> 00:05:24,13
Would come to name and we would see also that there is real value in being really skilled. Musicians but.

50
00:05:24,13 --> 00:05:31,72
But there's also wonderful found in. You know homegrown musicians and eventually the to do the difference disappears.

51
00:05:32,54 --> 00:05:40,67
The whole idea was to build a lifestyle in a place where. Where i suppose the base people would.

52
00:05:40,67 --> 00:06:01,77
Would want to come and leave. And they did. I think in the early days of newman it was.

53
00:06:01,77 --> 00:06:10,83
You had to be a bit braver in the sylph sufficient and have a bit of background. To leave. To leave the city.

54
00:06:10,83 --> 00:06:19,96
And there was nothing he. So it wasn't easy in any scenes. Major in a few people came to the.

55
00:06:19,96 --> 00:06:27,27
The aquarius festival and could. Without doing anything themselves kind of. You know.

56
00:06:27,27 --> 00:06:31,27
Leave off take from take from the others but actually moving up here there was.

57
00:06:31,27 --> 00:06:35,61
There was nothing we had to make their own relationships there and found their own music and.

58
00:06:35,61 --> 00:06:43,71
And that was great but i think any people with a with a certain energy and enthusiasm. Can do that and.

59
00:06:43,71 --> 00:06:50,31
I don't know about the concept of made innocent that time i was very much part of the anti psychiatry movement taking

60
00:06:50,31 --> 00:06:54,41
my fourth year on a psychology students to the.

61
00:06:54,41 --> 00:07:00,14
The psych hospitals and showing how they were diagnosed and brutalized and.

62
00:07:00,14 --> 00:07:09,47
And that they had that wasn't necessary wasn't as necessary is. As what was happening. And.

63
00:07:09,47 --> 00:07:14,51
So i don't know whether we were made i'm not sure whether we were people who couldn't cope in the city in kind of a

64
00:07:14,51 --> 00:07:20,14
place where we made a last hour that we could cope with or whether we would just create even energetic and wonderful

65
00:07:20,14 --> 00:07:24,78
and amazing. And the truth is probably a bit of both.

66
00:07:24,78 --> 00:07:29,06
As it is we i suppose with migrants in any situation i guess migrants are the.

67
00:07:29,06 --> 00:07:33,79
They're the best and the worst of any country the most creative but also the most dissatisfied.

68
00:07:33,79 --> 00:07:41,68
The strongest but also the least well adjusted though i don't know about all that. And.

69
00:07:43,41 --> 00:07:49,09
To a certain extent i think that. Real difficulties including possibly madness and sell and.

70
00:07:49,09 --> 00:07:54,28
To some extent could be could be coped with and absorbed and used to need to grow.

71
00:07:55,19 --> 00:07:59,39
And in a sort of last hour you were leading because it was.

72
00:07:59,39 --> 00:08:05,77
It was travel but it wasn't organized it was the way that you could. Your energy was welcome but it wasn't.

73
00:08:05,77 --> 00:08:11,83
On demand from nine to five. And i think that sort of continuity of.

74
00:08:11,83 --> 00:08:25,83
Of of the presence of other people without the without. Divided demands and. Structures and. Regular demands of people.

75
00:08:25,83 --> 00:08:34,29
Allows a lot more people to to adjust and be energy can give you the best and in a very ordered. Social system does.

76
00:08:44,77 --> 00:08:48,17
I think too in the early days we.

77
00:08:48,17 --> 00:08:57,08
We were fascinated by the differences between people between us we was very much the thought that we all had something

78
00:08:57,08 --> 00:09:05,73
to offer. And if it was really really far out. That was a good thing. Certainly wasn't threatening.

79
00:09:07,58 --> 00:09:12,37
You know a real freak with someone who was who was valued and. Interesting.

80
00:09:12,37 --> 00:09:18,38
Rather than someone who had problems always diagnosable who you couldn't quite.

81
00:09:18,38 --> 00:09:38,4
Make it all or just all control and skills. I remember sleeping when not in the dye and made of.

82
00:09:38,4 --> 00:09:45,01
Of probably mud bricks and concrete. That was completely started with bottles of different colors.

83
00:09:45,6 --> 00:09:51,27
So that when you lie down on the ground you looked out. Along the length of a bottle to the to the moonlight.

84
00:09:51,27 --> 00:10:01,5
And the whole thing was. Was a multi colored sort of. Psychedelic haven. Done over the top of you.

85
00:10:01,73 --> 00:10:12,18
And somebody lived in that. How could you judge a bit of. Good to judge whether that person was mad or just amazing.

86
00:10:12,67 --> 00:10:15,56
And i think there was a lot in the eastern spiritual tradition which.

87
00:10:16,17 --> 00:10:29,73
Which had a lot of trouble distinguishing between madness and spiritual. Than a spiritual craziness. And my friend.

88
00:10:29,73 --> 00:10:35,03
Harry frame in the psychiatrist he announces he has a lot of trouble distinguishing between a spiritual transformation

89
00:10:35,03 --> 00:10:56,28
and. An episode of medicine. And be too keen to tell which was which. Harry gumboots farley.

90
00:10:56,28 --> 00:11:00,00
An amazing person in my memory harry gumboot was.

91
00:11:00,00 --> 00:11:04,56
Out a tangible force where we all used to eat communally in the early days at the white house.

92
00:11:04,56 --> 00:11:08,23
Every month or so the hurry christians would come around and fetus and.

93
00:11:08,23 --> 00:11:14,58
Play music and we chant and sing this song that was wonderful but then we had to listen to the to the.

94
00:11:14,58 --> 00:11:18,27
Ten minute speech about how the world was created two hundred sixty seven years ago

95
00:11:18,27 --> 00:11:21,36
and even we couldn't take that sort of thing.

96
00:11:22,18 --> 00:11:28,2
The next time they came we made up a song called harry gumboot instead of harry reid our way saying have a gun with.

97
00:11:29,2 --> 00:11:35,66
And there was actually a person called harry gambit on time of of the times though it was. It was our way of a.

98
00:11:35,66 --> 00:11:38,46
Thing spiritual and joining in with anything without being.

99
00:11:39,3 --> 00:11:45,68
Without being silly about it and losing a sense of family and perspective. I mean even hippies.

100
00:11:45,68 --> 00:11:59,62
Can't believe the world was created two hundred sixty seven years ago. Once when i was living it. Explained.

101
00:12:02,13 --> 00:12:10,1
A few of us had been to thailand. To do meditation retreats and. A couple of the people bought. Time and.

102
00:12:10,1 --> 00:12:16,56
Back with them. Very much a new tradition of us sitting up there and. Nice down communities and so on and.

103
00:12:16,56 --> 00:12:19,86
I guess instead of building a church we bought the time and can.

104
00:12:20,55 --> 00:12:26,87
Building a little down up on the top and one of the shelves of land high above the. The explained.

105
00:12:27,62 --> 00:12:33,11
One of us at the time would be his. He's keepin. To look after him and.

106
00:12:33,11 --> 00:12:42,02
Every morning and afternoon there would be a meditation sitting around a ton of channeling. Time monk. So that.

107
00:12:42,02 --> 00:12:54,26
That's how we provided for. That was our church i suppose. Very little community for. A few years that lasted.

108
00:12:55,01 --> 00:12:59,67
After that to stay in a walk in sydney. It.

109
00:12:59,67 --> 00:13:04,8
And once when i asked janet chan what the secret of life was he said drink coffee

110
00:13:04,8 --> 00:13:10,86
and sleep that is the secret of life drink coffee and sleep.

111
00:13:12,79 --> 00:13:17,06
So if you want to have your own resident talking monkey discovered get one.

112
00:13:17,06 --> 00:13:22,55
You'll find someone who always find some part of the world that will cooperate with any scheme that's got enough.

113
00:13:22,55 --> 00:13:25,64
Imagination and there's got good energy to it.

114
00:13:35,11 --> 00:13:41,11
There are very few people in the men who set themselves up as gurus

115
00:13:41,11 --> 00:13:50,29
and there are a couple of exceptions to that statement. The world is full of gurus and it was wonderful to be able to.

116
00:13:50,29 --> 00:14:02,02
To adopt garous or ideas from. Religions and practices and. And build them into one's life and in. Then build.

117
00:14:02,02 --> 00:14:09,92
Just like being able to read the literature of the the world. They just ideas they just.

118
00:14:09,92 --> 00:14:19,75
Ways that some people have found to broaden and deepen in the spiritual and magic. Aspects of their lives i suppose.

119
00:14:19,75 --> 00:14:23,77
We had a good. We always had a good. Level of skepticism abets things.

120
00:14:25,82 --> 00:14:32,95
The hairy christians have found that they're always thought of as as being pretty strange really. In the world.

121
00:14:32,95 --> 00:14:35,4
It's got plenty of room for strange people.

122
00:14:35,4 --> 00:14:41,83
And the world that we left in the city didn't have room for strange people in it and it was. Its loss that it didn't.

123
00:14:41,83 --> 00:14:51,38
Was into diagnosing and. Excluding and and. One of the the original gurus i suppose in the city was marshall mcluhan.

124
00:14:53,7 --> 00:15:00,42
And the. At a more intellectual level who wrote a book called one dimensional man.

125
00:15:00,42 --> 00:15:06,38
And that was probably captured what we what we didn't like about what life was like in the city.

126
00:15:06,38 --> 00:15:13,38
It was one dimensional and fitted the new you and now you didn't have ideas. We never talked about it.

127
00:15:13,38 --> 00:15:20,28
One didn't talk about politics or religion. Certainly didn't talk about magical. Sexuality or drugs or. Fun.

128
00:15:20,28 --> 00:15:25,92
What adventure. That was or what they did in the seventeenth century when there was a world to explore.

129
00:15:25,92 --> 00:15:28,86
And suddenly with the help of some psychedelics we.

130
00:15:28,86 --> 00:15:33,81
We found there was an inner world to explore and it was not really nothing to stop the suspense.

131
00:15:39,79 --> 00:15:48,19
I think i think the presence of psychedelics to the beat of l.s.d. That was a randon. And some of the good dope was.

132
00:15:48,19 --> 00:15:59,03
I think it was probably fundamental and basic to too. To the whole new age thing. Really i think it probably was.

133
00:15:59,03 --> 00:16:07,38
I think it just let you see that there was another how. Dimension of possibilities about human life.

134
00:16:07,38 --> 00:16:15,44
And then of course you could read. Eastern literature and. And some of the.

135
00:16:15,44 --> 00:16:20,45
Some of the more spiritual western literature and know that people had lived.

136
00:16:20,45 --> 00:16:24,26
The experience of those dimensions of life in the past and why weren't we doing it.

137
00:16:24,26 --> 00:16:31,83
That birthright that's part of what we're capable of as human beings and. And we want to be able to do it.

138
00:16:31,83 --> 00:16:38,77
And it probably just looked a lot easier to do it out in the countryside. Amongst ourselves.

139
00:16:40,26 --> 00:16:47,12
Consenting to decide rather than to have to fight to do it and. You know a city where it was was thought out with.

140
00:16:47,12 --> 00:17:00,25
With disbelief and fear and. Yes.

141
00:17:00,25 --> 00:17:06,18
You get very much a sense of place of name and inversely anyone who spent any time hearings upcoming back.

142
00:17:06,18 --> 00:17:09,67
Whether to stay if they can away for the just keep coming back.

143
00:17:09,67 --> 00:17:17,03
There's something very magical about the fact that this is in the mountains. There's a lot of days when it's misty.

144
00:17:17,03 --> 00:17:26,68
Rainy. Quite quite hubbert like. That was probably one of the. One of the. Very important bits of.

145
00:17:26,68 --> 00:17:32,45
Western literature that that informed our way of life was. Tolkien spokes.

146
00:17:32,45 --> 00:17:36,05
Had to read talkings books and then you'd be just a bit prepared to leave the city

147
00:17:36,05 --> 00:17:43,61
and come in living in this lovely hobbit country where of the misty mountains where you can live around the mountain

148
00:17:43,61 --> 00:17:49,85
from somebody else and leave. Ten minutes walk away or five minutes walk away. And. And yet.

149
00:17:49,85 --> 00:17:56,1
Hardly see them and to know that there's a lot of really really magic and explored nature between you and them.

150
00:17:56,1 --> 00:18:02,95
And it tangible force for example a big commune here. The whole place is joined by walking tracks.

151
00:18:02,95 --> 00:18:11,64
Which go across numerous creeks and. Walking barefoot. Around tracks in the rainforest to see your neighbors.

152
00:18:11,64 --> 00:18:16,54
In the misty days or in the evenings with glow worms on the way and.

153
00:18:16,54 --> 00:18:24,27
Animals in the trees is just a life that's full and rich of nature and magic and spirituality and.

154
00:18:24,27 --> 00:18:30,64
It's very different from living in a fibro house in bankstown. And going to sydney university to learn.

155
00:18:32,11 --> 00:19:05,75
Something or other. Ok. Ok. It's similar to. It. Yeah. Yeah. Which. Tricks. Day i am and i. So.

156
00:19:05,75 --> 00:19:08,12
My name's diana roberts.

157
00:19:08,12 --> 00:19:14,3
Currently an alderman on this small city council which i had been for the last fifteen months or so and.

158
00:19:14,3 --> 00:19:20,69
I hope honest i own my own business in women which i share with a friend or not been practicing in them

159
00:19:20,69 --> 00:19:27,34
and as a herbalist on and off since i moved here. I use a god. I live on a community.

160
00:19:27,34 --> 00:19:35,78
About twelve calamitous from women with nine other. Households. We have fifteen children.

161
00:19:35,78 --> 00:19:44,3
Fifteen adults so we're quite a big community. And i have a five year old daughter.

162
00:19:48,52 --> 00:19:52,23
About thirteen years ago when i was living in sydney.

163
00:19:52,23 --> 00:19:58,88
My partner and i decided that we would really like to live to move to the bush we both came from a rural area

164
00:19:58,88 --> 00:20:04,31
and i used and we'd lived in sydney for ten years

165
00:20:04,31 --> 00:20:09,17
and didn't really want to be a part of that sort of environment anymore not because we didn't like it

166
00:20:09,17 --> 00:20:17,02
but because we wanted to china and wanted something else. And we got together a group of people. There were six of us.

167
00:20:17,02 --> 00:20:24,47
And we spent about six months looking for land. In rural areas along the coast north of sydney and.

168
00:20:24,47 --> 00:20:30,63
The further we got from sydney the cheaper the land became. And we eventually found this place of land.

169
00:20:30,63 --> 00:20:38,48
Name and that was a piece of land that we could afford. And that we were also able to develop as a multiple occupancy.

170
00:20:38,48 --> 00:20:49,09
So that was just over ten years ago and here we are. As. Pimpernel as. It's a one hundred icas that used to be.

171
00:20:49,09 --> 00:20:54,26
It probably once was dairying country. And then. As the land became more and more.

172
00:20:54,75 --> 00:21:03,03
Degraded it was basically just grazing country. But it was a very sort of low grade. You know low quality pace of land.

173
00:21:03,03 --> 00:21:10,52
When we moved here. We've got. I told nine families. Now. Living here.

174
00:21:10,52 --> 00:21:16,87
And we've also built our own houses are in the process of building our own houses.

175
00:21:16,87 --> 00:21:24,87
We are not a sort of a tight community in that we've done. Sort of eat together. And spend a lot of our time together.

176
00:21:24,87 --> 00:21:29,7
However we're very sort of closely knit community in that we socialize together a lot.

177
00:21:29,7 --> 00:21:37,28
We play volleyball together once away. It's a very supportive community and we're all good friends.

178
00:21:37,28 --> 00:21:44,89
I'd have to say it's taken quite a long time to get to that point. We've seen people who've come and gone.

179
00:21:44,89 --> 00:21:49,07
Specially in the first five years that sort of a real.

180
00:21:49,07 --> 00:21:54,05
Initiation time that paypal who move on to multiple occupancies in that.

181
00:21:54,05 --> 00:21:56,87
You know you have to learn to live with a group of people.

182
00:21:56,87 --> 00:22:03,23
You don't have anything to live inside you're also building your houses. It's a very stressful time.

183
00:22:03,23 --> 00:22:06,84
Generally for relationships because you suddenly spent.

184
00:22:06,84 --> 00:22:10,64
Spending a lot of time with your partner which you might never have done before.

185
00:22:10,64 --> 00:22:13,92
So it's almost like getting to know your partner you getting to know your family

186
00:22:13,92 --> 00:22:19,72
and you getting to largest group of people that you've never met before and. You're living in.

187
00:22:19,72 --> 00:22:25,09
You know pretty primitive conditions in the early dies and i lived.

188
00:22:25,09 --> 00:22:32,69
Just a pace obtain a bat to mate his boss or a mate us a slipped in a tent with eleanor's and snakes

189
00:22:32,69 --> 00:22:38,89
and you know not jumping ants and all sorts of. Interesting little crate just.

190
00:22:38,89 --> 00:22:47,01
I endured about six months of almost continual rain when i first moved here which was the must.

191
00:22:47,01 --> 00:22:54,26
Frustrating experience for somebody trying to build a house and get a decent roof fiver ahead. And i.

192
00:22:54,27 --> 00:23:01,18
I also found myself in a situation of. Building my own house when. Prior to moving here.

193
00:23:01,18 --> 00:23:05,47
And i reckon aka camp on one hand the number of times i'd picked up a hammer.

194
00:23:05,47 --> 00:23:11,89
Probably never used a drill in my life and i've never ever seen a four inch nile before.

195
00:23:11,89 --> 00:23:20,49
And i know all those things intimately now and have a house. To live in that.

196
00:23:20,49 --> 00:23:27,61
A lot of which i built myself i'm quite proud of it. I think that the people have lived here.

197
00:23:27,61 --> 00:23:34,32
Not chosen sort of different ways to build their houses. And we have some stein houses where we've sort of. Quarried.

198
00:23:34,32 --> 00:23:43,78
You know made small quarries. In some in some of our hills. But generally we're all pretty comfortable. And i think.

199
00:23:43,78 --> 00:23:49,76
You know happy with the last minute. It's a very sort of place and. Although very sort of.

200
00:23:49,76 --> 00:24:05,02
Challenging in confronting way to live. We had a lot of struggles and nearly dies when we came here.

201
00:24:05,2 --> 00:24:12,92
We had struggles with that and neighbors who were very resistant to the idea of having a multiple occupancy.

202
00:24:12,92 --> 00:24:19,95
Next door and. We went through. Fairly unpleasant processes of taking neighbors.

203
00:24:19,95 --> 00:24:26,15
To court until we realised that relates. You know that sort of. The legal why wasn't the light.

204
00:24:26,15 --> 00:24:30,75
And it was you know much better to try and negotiate.

205
00:24:30,75 --> 00:24:38,66
Solutions with neigbor so relate just to sort of let them bathe and let time sort of heal those divisions.

206
00:24:38,66 --> 00:24:43,54
We also had difficult times. You know between ourselves just learning to live together.

207
00:24:43,54 --> 00:24:52,34
And then we also had very difficult times. With council. We put in a development application. After we bought the land.

208
00:24:52,34 --> 00:24:55,59
Which was fairly common practice in. Dies.

209
00:24:55,59 --> 00:25:02,37
And still is to sight in some ways i mean you get a few developers who put in a development application.

210
00:25:02,37 --> 00:25:04,58
Before they actually found the paypal.

211
00:25:04,58 --> 00:25:08,61
But the many people setting up a community had all found a paypal found a piece of land

212
00:25:08,61 --> 00:25:12,29
and then they put in the development application. To council.

213
00:25:12,29 --> 00:25:20,52
And in those days i think we would have put ads in about eight years ago. It was a very unfriendly. Council and.

214
00:25:20,52 --> 00:25:22,15
Unfriendly. Council staff.

215
00:25:22,15 --> 00:25:30,56
And we had an incredible struggle trying to negotiate what we felt would raise noble conditions under which our

216
00:25:30,56 --> 00:25:37,44
development could be approved. And it took us quite a few years and it cost us quite a lot of money. And once again.

217
00:25:37,44 --> 00:25:45,36
You know the only options to us. In the end. Were to follow the legal process and to take counsel to call and.

218
00:25:45,36 --> 00:25:52,18
We actually decided not to do that ultimately because that becomes a very different scenario once you're in court

219
00:25:52,18 --> 00:26:20,55
and the actual reality gets lost in. You know in the lagos sort of jargon and practice here.

220
00:26:21,52 --> 00:26:27,55
I think liz more cancels a much more friendly counsel now as far as multiple occupancy guys although this still a lot

221
00:26:27,55 --> 00:26:34,09
of prejudice. Among some of the older men and stuff and i think that a lot of ignorance.

222
00:26:34,09 --> 00:26:37,56
About multiple occupancy last allam want to actually manes this.

223
00:26:37,56 --> 00:26:43,7
Vision of a whole lot of hippies living in substandard conditions. In the hills whereas in fact.

224
00:26:43,7 --> 00:26:46,09
You know it's not like that are told and.

225
00:26:46,09 --> 00:26:52,12
I've often thought it would be really valuable to take you know people on tours of multiple occupancy so they can

226
00:26:52,12 --> 00:26:54,26
actually see how people live.

227
00:26:55,03 --> 00:26:57,91
You know what the values are of those people

228
00:26:57,91 --> 00:27:03,14
and the values of those people are no different to paypal in a lot of community. It's just there's.

229
00:27:03,14 --> 00:27:10,66
These perceptions that. You know that we are different. I think on other councils that perhaps.

230
00:27:10,66 --> 00:27:14,00
You know the situation isn't as friendly towards.

231
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:18,85
Multiple occupancies always easy i'm not saying it's friendly and it's not council but it's daisy.

232
00:27:18,85 --> 00:27:25,58
And we saw a situation named. Caio council about three years ago where they actually demolished somebodies house.

233
00:27:26,2 --> 00:27:33,91
This was a bamboo house it was a really beautiful house that had been built by a local bamboo. House build on amazon.

234
00:27:33,91 --> 00:27:42,05
By a woman who had three young children and. I think the perception on the council was that.

235
00:27:42,05 --> 00:27:50,13
Here we had a woman living in an illegal house that was meant to be a template dwelling. But an illegal house in.

236
00:27:50,13 --> 00:27:56,98
Substandard. Sort of. Third world conditions because she had a ramdisk floor and she had a pit toilet which.

237
00:27:56,98 --> 00:27:58,92
Many of us had and.

238
00:27:58,92 --> 00:28:05,78
That it was a bamboo house like you see in asia and that created all sorts of sort of shock horror and.

239
00:28:05,78 --> 00:28:09,1
Incredibly negative ill informed comments.

240
00:28:09,1 --> 00:28:15,34
I feel from people who you know are in a position to know better and should be better informed and.

241
00:28:15,34 --> 00:28:23,18
In a very sort of heavy handed way. Council came out and demolished the house. Fortunately we don't say.

242
00:28:23,18 --> 00:28:29,15
You know that happening too often not there was a situation in lismore in about seventy eight might be a little bit

243
00:28:29,15 --> 00:28:36,2
earlier where. Lismore canso trott demolished a couple of houses and i lost that battle in court and.

244
00:28:36,2 --> 00:28:41,41
I think they've really sort of laid off since then because it costs a lot of money.

245
00:28:41,41 --> 00:28:49,07
You know if it counsels to go to court. The way that we say the. Sort of prejudice coming through now is just in the.

246
00:28:49,07 --> 00:28:54,26
The conditions that applies done. Multiple occupancies when they put in their development application.

247
00:28:54,72 --> 00:29:01,00
The standards the canso requires of them and. I think they're often.

248
00:29:01,00 --> 00:29:08,41
Unreasonable and also there's not a recognition that multiple occupancy. Was designed really as a form of.

249
00:29:08,41 --> 00:29:13,7
Development that would provide low cost housing for low income people.

250
00:29:13,7 --> 00:29:18,64
And if you impose really harsh development conditions. On to those people.

251
00:29:18,64 --> 00:29:25,97
Then they're you know they're not able to comply with them for a start so they end up living in illegal situations.

252
00:29:25,97 --> 00:29:31,82
And it would process. Multiple occupancy into a much more sort of middle class.

253
00:29:31,82 --> 00:29:38,23
Market so you disenfranchising low income people. And you know really the only opportunity they had to.

254
00:29:38,23 --> 00:29:39,78
Are in their own pace of land

255
00:29:39,78 --> 00:29:49,53
and to build their own house to give them some sort of security that i believe everybody has a right to sort of lost.

256
00:29:49,53 --> 00:30:10,58
The trial. Local politics. Do you want to focus on women politics. Politics in women is a very complex issue and.

257
00:30:10,58 --> 00:30:11,88
Are must say.

258
00:30:11,88 --> 00:30:20,91
In the fifteen months that i've been on council i've found it particularly difficult at times to come to terms with

259
00:30:20,91 --> 00:30:25,84
your mate. Somebody for instance in one social situation and they'll say one thing.

260
00:30:25,84 --> 00:30:32,01
And then you hear that in you know another social situation with a different group of people they've said something

261
00:30:32,01 --> 00:30:40,63
quite different from a i think. My observation in him than is that the turning point in community politics.

262
00:30:40,63 --> 00:30:44,77
Happened probably about two and a half years ago.

263
00:30:44,77 --> 00:30:54,26
When the last federal election was held in this state which had been traditionally a national party say. Was lost.

264
00:30:54,48 --> 00:31:01,99
By the national party to the labor party and. I would say that. Helen called a cop who was a long time.

265
00:31:01,99 --> 00:31:09,08
Paced campaigner who stood as an independent and had a great deal of the peo to paypal in this electorate.

266
00:31:09,08 --> 00:31:16,04
Was really the the k. Race in ma that was won by labor. And lost by the national party.

267
00:31:16,04 --> 00:31:24,78
Subsequently to that there was a resurgence of activity. By the national party. Within this whole area and.

268
00:31:24,78 --> 00:31:33,32
Name and wasn't sort of. Spared that act. That activity. At the same time in name and. They were. Paper.

269
00:31:33,32 --> 00:31:38,37
Developers who'd moved into the area. Who bought up a lot of the land surrounding the village.

270
00:31:38,37 --> 00:31:44,37
And who were very keen to say name and develop so that was putting a lot of pressure on women

271
00:31:44,37 --> 00:31:50,98
and combined with that there was that debate about whether to put in a centralised serious came into the village. That.
