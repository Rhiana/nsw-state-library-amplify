1
00:00:09,01 --> 00:00:19,43
Caught in some way they are after i got to go in and it is in. Train sickly egg. I mean if i can be right.

2
00:00:30,91 --> 00:00:39,43
Their relationship between freedom and community. Is.

3
00:00:39,43 --> 00:00:46,68
Of course so intense that my stokley needs to talk about i've affected as well.

4
00:00:46,68 --> 00:00:55,01
You know order to get more of a secular view instead of a polarize ation.

5
00:00:55,01 --> 00:00:57,6
You can look at the name

6
00:00:57,6 --> 00:01:05,52
and experience as being one way of people came with an ideal of being very communal sharing everything

7
00:01:05,52 --> 00:01:21,27
and have gone full circle and become. Family. Suburban and separate families. But also within the first three months.

8
00:01:21,27 --> 00:01:30,91
Of town a befalls. That was separate has is being started. After much discussion. Much talk.

9
00:01:30,91 --> 00:01:38,69
There was simply the no you don't die get is and mandy get this is pot. To have. I separate spice.

10
00:01:39,41 --> 00:01:48,35
Because they had children. The force of children. Drove them to stop. Work on the first independent.

11
00:01:48,35 --> 00:02:00,65
New hass at autonomy force. And just to not be so troublesome.

12
00:02:00,65 --> 00:02:09,9
Not just for themselves but for other people because children really really want to a huge amount of their.

13
00:02:09,9 --> 00:02:17,9
Spice their privacy and their ownership of their parents that when those parents come through the door. They're there.

14
00:02:17,9 --> 00:02:30,4
With does children. And very quickly. It became. Well as soon as that started with and. I came to the can.

15
00:02:30,62 --> 00:02:36,12
Luzhin of bringing in the wood hammer us. And of and of saying look this gang.

16
00:02:36,12 --> 00:02:42,43
This is going to happen all over the place about. Let's try to have those houses being built in clusters of houses.

17
00:02:43,65 --> 00:02:53,21
Let's call them hamlets. And let's try to get those to work together in a particular area.

18
00:02:53,21 --> 00:03:01,7
And to share some of the land together. And maybe their fruit crops or certainly their access. And whatever.

19
00:03:01,7 --> 00:03:12,84
Things that they want to share together. Let's just encourage people to share. The us by the block.

20
00:03:13,68 --> 00:03:20,36
If you're thinking in terms of the city. You'd mess like we'd be looking at all the backyards in one particular block.

21
00:03:20,83 --> 00:03:27,6
Or you might be looking at the. In some streets of the front yards and. In a street. Because the street is in fact.

22
00:03:27,6 --> 00:03:39,48
More a part of the place. Than the back out. At any right. That started. And we we had these hamlets going.

23
00:03:39,48 --> 00:03:46,72
Right away there was that level of privacy. Right away at the beginning there was always i.

24
00:03:46,72 --> 00:03:56,34
Privacy in people's economics. There was no. Sharing of money you know why the sense. And.

25
00:04:00,19 --> 00:04:07,07
It's just as likely that in the future. Niemann will be count more. Communal.

26
00:04:07,07 --> 00:04:16,94
In terms of the work that people are doing together. Because when people are building their own houses. And that.

27
00:04:16,94 --> 00:04:21,73
Sharing a bit of life with a child or but they're basically they're building their own houses.

28
00:04:21,73 --> 00:04:32,74
In that phase that they're very isolated. And that's communal in many ways. So i think that. Time. Newman.

29
00:04:32,74 --> 00:04:41,22
Might become more sharing. And hopefully with that. It might in fact.

30
00:04:41,22 --> 00:04:47,98
Be more willing to worry about its common problems. Its community problems.

31
00:04:47,98 --> 00:04:57,78
And to share responsibility for those community problems and to actually step in and take action about those. What's.

32
00:05:01,73 --> 00:05:12,93
What is. I suppose for me as a writer. In women. There is a lot of individuals.

33
00:05:12,93 --> 00:05:23,37
It's a lot of people who don't fit into. Easy molds and. There's a lot of people who while.

34
00:05:23,37 --> 00:05:36,51
Often falling into very normal suburban. Patterns. Also break a huge number of those patterns. So that there is.

35
00:05:36,51 --> 00:05:47,02
I bit more on the steering of my imagination. Into. What is possible and. There is an easy. Sharing of ideas.

36
00:05:47,02 --> 00:05:56,64
Among some people like it here at the. Bush the era. You know there is not many towns where there is a theater.

37
00:05:56,64 --> 00:06:00,44
Which is just sharing movies but where the guests.

38
00:06:00,44 --> 00:06:05,91
Actually come and talk to each other for some half an hour before hand and. At interval.

39
00:06:05,91 --> 00:06:12,59
And the end of always specially designed to be ultra long extended indigo in the middle of a movie so that everyone

40
00:06:12,59 --> 00:06:17,45
talks to. Evers they're that they're friends of or other people they just mating.

41
00:06:17,45 --> 00:06:26,82
And that the the whole movie experience is in fact as much a talking. Communal meeting place. Experience.

42
00:06:26,82 --> 00:06:38,95
As anything else. It's almost like a church. Experience. So that's really beautiful. And the bush the at her in the.

43
00:06:38,95 --> 00:06:46,68
In the just drowning here is something that's really special for me. Also i love this. But.

44
00:06:46,68 --> 00:06:57,8
I love the factory as a building. I think it's quite grey and. It's got to be to full aka textual. Features and and.

45
00:06:57,8 --> 00:07:07,39
And shape. The whole valleys. A very beautiful valley. I've got a very close relationship with the local.

46
00:07:07,39 --> 00:07:20,47
Curry population and. I work with them and. I think that the whole valley still has a huge potential which it.

47
00:07:20,47 --> 00:07:29,62
Just one does on. Disregarding and perhaps that. In the future.

48
00:07:29,62 --> 00:07:39,26
That potential might actually be i wouldn't be utilised and really unleashed. And in between time i think i suppose.

49
00:07:39,26 --> 00:07:49,74
It gives me. The chance to think about what. Individual communities across the world. Could be doing. Themselves.

50
00:07:49,74 --> 00:07:57,04
And i love the neighborhood community level. You know i mean in the in the small thousands.

51
00:07:58,26 --> 00:08:05,57
Maybe four to sixteen thousand. And in that field. How much what can a. Can and.

52
00:08:05,57 --> 00:08:10,64
Community of that size really do for itself and how good a quality of life can it have.

53
00:08:10,64 --> 00:08:16,69
And what are the economics of that. What is the reality of that. And what structures and ideas.

54
00:08:16,69 --> 00:08:33,03
Have to actually be consciously working. For that to happen. Yeah yeah yeah. That's. Well i could just mention that.

55
00:08:33,03 --> 00:08:43,69
Part of that sort of thinking of the. Four to sixteen thousand people. Is part of what i call a g.i. Village concept.

56
00:08:44,2 --> 00:08:52,83
And it's related to. Ideas that i have a conceptual framework that i have which.

57
00:08:54,66 --> 00:08:59,58
Go into any explore the question of how many people would you need.

58
00:08:59,58 --> 00:09:11,05
Working in what sort of ways to have a post mechanical. Communities economics. Giving the i quality of life.

59
00:09:11,05 --> 00:09:21,47
That includes the world. That keeps people in contact with and understanding. The latest ideas in the world.

60
00:09:21,93 --> 00:09:29,81
And i will to actually put some of them into place. To actually utilize them and to work them through. What's.

61
00:09:29,81 --> 00:09:39,27
What is the relationship. We've. We we've got some strong ideas now of what a nomadic. Community social economics.

62
00:09:39,27 --> 00:09:47,84
Pattern is. And we've got lots of examples of. Agrarian. Such patterns.

63
00:09:47,84 --> 00:09:56,58
And we've got lots of examples of mechanical wage. Patterns. But what that post mechanical. Pattern is.

64
00:09:57,91 --> 00:10:19,07
Now and quite knows where. For you what you do with people. Jumping from one.

65
00:10:19,07 --> 00:10:30,4
Idea to another from one project to another the. The. Linking the linking thing for myself is. Is understanding.

66
00:10:30,45 --> 00:10:38,87
The reality is is a clarifying. And exploring all of. And testing out of.

67
00:10:38,87 --> 00:10:48,87
And then trying to be very specific about what reality is how it works. And how it can work. Better.

68
00:10:48,87 --> 00:11:02,8
And all of these different stories. Music oh yeah lane and all of these different things.

69
00:11:02,8 --> 00:11:06,48
Sort of just fit in with a pattern that.

70
00:11:06,48 --> 00:11:13,35
I explore in my brain trying to cope with this mad reality that we're stuck in and trying to simplify

71
00:11:13,35 --> 00:11:22,46
and clarify it more than simplify. I think the complexities ok as long as we clear it. And clarify.

72
00:11:22,46 --> 00:11:29,85
And make it easier to understand it doesn't need to be simple. We don't need to simplify things to the extreme.

73
00:11:29,85 --> 00:11:49,17
We can cope with a pretty complex world. As long as we're clear about the complexities. Ok. So i thought. Monday.

74
00:11:49,17 --> 00:11:56,91
And you know you guys you guys just do it.

75
00:11:56,91 --> 00:12:10,91
I mean the tan during the equerries there's still a nine hundred seventy three license before or after.

76
00:12:10,91 --> 00:12:21,34
You for a very quiet. Nice peaceful town. It's worth estimate. Just sight before.

77
00:12:21,34 --> 00:12:36,61
And before the festival tallis very quiet place for women. Love it i thought loop. I was. Going downhill. I believe.

78
00:12:36,61 --> 00:12:46,85
Ma business wasn't really paying. Well at that time. And the extra people it came certainly boosted it.

79
00:12:47,95 --> 00:13:08,02
So what do you see. The first time i heard of it were. Three or four guys. In crime dunston one of them.

80
00:13:08,02 --> 00:13:10,25
Arrived in to tear into the shop one day

81
00:13:10,25 --> 00:13:21,01
and started to use what i propose to do that was the first thought heard of it sort of through all the sands

82
00:13:21,01 --> 00:13:33,6
or i meant. You know i sort of didn't really know what they were getting at at that time. You know.

83
00:13:37,99 --> 00:13:44,2
I think the biggest majority were for having this system will. There were two or three that weren't.

84
00:13:45,63 --> 00:14:01,01
But they didn't voice their opinions if they were against it. If you did but not. We love. You know.

85
00:14:01,01 --> 00:14:06,23
Not a real lot now and then i was there briefly but i didn't stay.

86
00:14:06,23 --> 00:14:09,16
To them howl of the main thing

87
00:14:09,16 --> 00:14:15,59
but i think the biggest percentage of the business people in that hand were sort of along the line just thinking oh yes

88
00:14:15,59 --> 00:14:38,58
this could be good. It was prior to actually. Of course. Financially i thought you know would. Help us all. Oh yes.

89
00:14:40,8 --> 00:14:55,33
Yes. There was a lot of activity leading up to it. But not a great.

90
00:14:55,33 --> 00:15:02,05
Big lot of people are awed but there were a few running away and working in getting these together getting it together.

91
00:15:02,5 --> 00:15:03,73
I think in the first.

92
00:15:03,73 --> 00:15:09,16
Dial so i wouldn't think any of us realized that the name and would never have as many people in it you know.

93
00:15:09,16 --> 00:15:13,33
Coming in buses and. What have you and of course everybody was.

94
00:15:13,33 --> 00:15:24,89
Interest to be interested to see what they looked like and. Well first.

95
00:15:24,89 --> 00:15:30,8
I was probably a little bit shocked that the way they dressed in the.

96
00:15:30,8 --> 00:15:38,26
You know the state of their hair and the no shoes and the light sort of thing you know.

97
00:15:38,26 --> 00:15:50,66
Most probably probably could say i was shocked. You know. Well.

98
00:15:50,66 --> 00:15:57,64
I made a lot of really nice people and i got like a lot of people. My chin good friends among them.

99
00:15:59,84 --> 00:16:04,62
And i was sort of they weren't as far as i'm concerned and.

100
00:16:04,62 --> 00:16:14,38
In my business there wasn't a real lot of people who i disliked. There were a few. But not many. You know.

101
00:16:14,38 --> 00:16:26,55
I really did sort of get on well with all of them and. I think they got on well with me too. So. Well you know.

102
00:16:27,37 --> 00:16:33,93
Well i don't have many memories there are. Did was well that car didn't get out into the fields or at.

103
00:16:33,93 --> 00:16:41,18
So had my shop actually. We worked from six o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the morning some don't and.

104
00:16:41,18 --> 00:16:47,43
I was sort of in the background or if i wasn't in the shop was at the bank over noising and.

105
00:16:47,43 --> 00:16:59,14
So i sort of didn't say anything much that we don't like to the activities that we don't know. What was on the menu.

106
00:16:59,14 --> 00:17:23,17
Just and we'd use in him the poison. Just. Just a lot of junk very popular. Yes well it certainly boosted. Business.

107
00:17:23,17 --> 00:17:26,87
We didn't. Mike a real lot of money because we had to pry.

108
00:17:26,87 --> 00:17:34,17
Too much wine why just to keep things flowing in and even right you know i was very very busy.

109
00:17:34,17 --> 00:17:45,28
To get that stage i had during the festival employed twenty seven people. So i my self. So. Money didn't we.

110
00:17:45,28 --> 00:18:03,95
My dad money but not a lot of money. So much. So as you know you know if i had.

111
00:18:03,95 --> 00:18:08,62
Harry freeman in this was it after the festival.

112
00:18:08,62 --> 00:18:14,98
I have a frame and had a few patients here who who wouldn't take their medication and.

113
00:18:16,72 --> 00:18:17,76
He called out

114
00:18:17,76 --> 00:18:26,29
and i sort of took over the job of making sure that these particular people we knew we had a medication up on a

115
00:18:26,29 --> 00:18:30,4
cupboard and. When they come in of a morning. A lot of them up and gave them their medicine or whatever.

116
00:18:30,55 --> 00:18:47,42
So let's stay on the probably. On a little bit of an even keel. So what's my schizophrenia explaining.

117
00:18:47,42 --> 00:18:55,06
We said to say that at times when. You know when they were really. Off the beaten track.

118
00:18:55,06 --> 00:19:01,3
And it was only purely and simply because they weren't taking the medication. So we. We sort of.

119
00:19:01,3 --> 00:19:10,02
Tried to help them out as much as possible. About whether we were. Thank for it all went by appreciate it but we tried.

120
00:19:13,8 --> 00:19:23,76
Yes i think that the tam didn't believe that as many people would study here we.

121
00:19:24,14 --> 00:19:32,91
Well i personally thought that says the festival was i mean everything was cleaned up everybody would go didn't happen

122
00:19:32,91 --> 00:19:36,06
did it.

123
00:19:36,06 --> 00:19:56,04
You just don't think they realized that people would want to study you know i don't know where you are just one of my

124
00:19:56,04 --> 00:20:07,2
impressions probably and i don't like the street scene at the moment.

125
00:20:07,2 --> 00:20:15,19
I don't think that it's gradually going downhill but whether that had anything to do with the aquarius festival and no.

126
00:20:15,19 --> 00:20:30,4
Probably not. I think that. In the last ten years with the peace. Scene in the street. Has actually gone downhill. But.

127
00:20:30,55 --> 00:20:31,59
Doing the festival and.

128
00:20:31,59 --> 00:20:40,25
I don't believe that there were any heavy drugs here there would drugs but i don't think you need heavy drugs

129
00:20:40,25 --> 00:20:49,43
and i'm really. I'm a bit disappointed that the pan has turned. You know like it has you know.

130
00:20:49,43 --> 00:20:56,56
I think the parents probably doing well financially as you know of the business of probably thriving now.

131
00:20:56,56 --> 00:21:04,84
For all of the people that. But i hear in his diet he and i don't. Just.

132
00:21:04,84 --> 00:21:29,12
Actually you know like what's happening in japan at the moment. Do you think it's so it was ok. Was it him.

133
00:21:29,12 --> 00:21:39,56
I don't really know i wouldn't say it's a better tan i would think probably you know a lot so why is it easy. I guess.

134
00:21:39,56 --> 00:21:42,49
Because maine is.

135
00:21:42,49 --> 00:21:46,35
Employment in the area an ammo business and that sort of thing

136
00:21:46,35 --> 00:21:56,45
but whether that can be put down to the fact that with the queries first of all that. My dad had been i don't know.

137
00:21:56,45 --> 00:22:15,46
You know. Any idea what we're going to look i don't know. It probably would have died. I would say.

138
00:22:15,46 --> 00:22:23,64
It was certainly on the downhill run before. As far as money making. Goes you know. Business area.

139
00:22:26,41 --> 00:22:34,79
I believe it was on the downhill run. But. The general trend. Probably would have brought.

140
00:22:34,79 --> 00:22:38,21
Different people he any help with the grace festival been healed

141
00:22:38,21 --> 00:22:44,32
or not because fans all around the area would believe of me

142
00:22:44,32 --> 00:22:48,36
and difference it was of come from the city to younger people to get a wife and also.

143
00:22:48,36 --> 00:22:54,26
I think probably would have happened to nieman as in a certain extent in here. If you.

144
00:22:54,26 --> 00:23:09,53
Was ever any thing to say oh yes they're still lees and.

145
00:23:09,53 --> 00:23:24,03
Had to us know how to explain it mean that the still a lot of the older residents. Stand back.

146
00:23:24,03 --> 00:23:33,48
When this any of the miranda i'd like excepting there has been a bit of animosity. You know. Cause.

147
00:23:33,48 --> 00:23:37,03
It's a flare ups of arguments with different ones and.

148
00:23:37,03 --> 00:23:46,65
But i don't sort of joining that scene anymore and sort of really know what is happening.

149
00:23:46,65 --> 00:23:54,32
That they used to be a lot of the van tagging ism between.

150
00:23:54,32 --> 00:24:01,4
The hippies in the streitz especially the guys that used to go to the pub. You know they'd be all the questions and.

151
00:24:01,4 --> 00:24:06,7
What have you between them and a lot of them. Uncalled for billy.

152
00:24:06,7 --> 00:24:21,33
But not really you know there's been so many little incidents that.

153
00:24:21,33 --> 00:24:28,78
You know i don't really remember a thing but you know you hear back in the news you sometimes i had seen them.

154
00:24:28,78 --> 00:24:45,87
Doing and. What have you. And. You know now i never ever did i always got on well with them.

155
00:24:46,29 --> 00:24:55,95
I think i probably got more problems with accepting the. Pre-political here now who are coming into the area now that.

156
00:24:55,95 --> 00:25:04,61
I mean they're not all bad. But i think i have no problem accepting them then i did back in seventy three.

157
00:25:05,93 --> 00:25:14,89
I think it's. Maybe it's not. It might be but i know about them you know what i see and think going in and.

158
00:25:14,89 --> 00:25:20,87
You know that you on drugs and that sort of thing i think that's what i sort of.

159
00:25:20,87 --> 00:25:27,19
You know i find it hard to accept and then to try and be friendly

160
00:25:27,19 --> 00:25:35,34
and nice to all paper let me ask whether they would be hippies or. Come straight to whatever.

161
00:25:35,34 --> 00:26:01,41
It was really you know cancer of the moment or cancer or think of anything. You main.

162
00:26:01,41 --> 00:26:14,00
During festival call after festival time no one. I would deem.

163
00:26:15,66 --> 00:26:21,45
I don't really doubt one of the funniest things i saw wasn't funny but. It was amazing.

164
00:26:21,45 --> 00:26:27,73
There were so many people in my shop and ours up and damning on the canton. And the walls were all.

165
00:26:27,73 --> 00:26:33,77
Cream walls in this particular room where i used to. Gowns it made and.

166
00:26:33,77 --> 00:26:40,5
I went in a half way through the morning one morning and they all got pictures. Drawn. I did all over them.

167
00:26:40,5 --> 00:26:47,47
The were coming with their. Paints and brushes and. Painted pictures around the walls and.

168
00:26:47,47 --> 00:26:52,26
Actually we left them a few years knees i don't know where they were got to with that.

169
00:26:52,26 --> 00:26:57,58
But the shop after had to pull down front away but there was some very good.

170
00:26:57,58 --> 00:27:03,54
Pictures that that was sort of set me back i think oh goodness me that didn't take long for that to happen.

171
00:27:03,73 --> 00:27:28,82
It was interesting. But i can't really think of to know too much. So you know what. I think so. You know how much you.

172
00:27:28,82 --> 00:27:34,51
Probably didn't change that much. Dried away. But i go i came in and.

173
00:27:34,51 --> 00:27:40,49
Painted all pictures on the roofs and on the front of the shops and that sort of thing.

174
00:27:40,49 --> 00:27:54,59
But that was some time off so it was a straight away. So you know. Yes so i had.

175
00:27:54,59 --> 00:28:06,63
You know or my youngest boy it was one year. Oh. During festival time and i had two girls who lived with me.

176
00:28:06,63 --> 00:28:20,3
And another son who's. He was that night. I got a lot out of the festival and said they would try the one year old did.

177
00:28:20,3 --> 00:28:22,84
But. The girls did die. And i made.

178
00:28:22,84 --> 00:28:30,4
Heaps of friends and sort of joined in activities when my head trauma from the shop and. I really enjoy.

179
00:28:30,41 --> 00:28:35,12
I would actually just thing that last know if you know them both.

180
00:28:35,12 --> 00:28:40,21
One more so than yeah those in there are glad i experienced it. You know. And.

181
00:28:40,21 --> 00:28:46,15
But she was a little bit old and was old enough to probably appreciate what was happening around.

182
00:28:46,15 --> 00:28:55,3
But the other one was the sort of. Appreciate it much but she said she's. Glad she experienced it too.

183
00:28:55,3 --> 00:29:16,03
So you know that i grew up and. Yes. We didn't stop them from associating with the new settlers or. You know and.

184
00:29:16,03 --> 00:29:28,07
They used to go visit people and. Dinners and then they places. I think probably. The boy. Let us letting them do that.

185
00:29:28,07 --> 00:29:34,00
It's sort of opened their eyes as to what can happen to people and.

186
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:39,13
None of them ever wanted to sort of go in that direction.

187
00:29:39,13 --> 00:29:47,05
But i think they could probably say you know that for what that last not for me.

188
00:29:47,9 --> 00:29:58,03
You know they had the opportunity to do it if i wanted to but i didn't. So when you tell them you know just.

189
00:29:58,03 --> 00:30:06,32
Just leaving in rags and and not coming your hair and.

190
00:30:06,32 --> 00:30:16,3
Going shoe alyson that sort of thing they just think they sort of well you know i don't want to do that.

191
00:30:16,3 --> 00:30:24,00
You know a guy had the opportunity to do it. Had i wanted to. But none of them have wanted to.

192
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:43,97
I'm actually glad about that. And you know. So there is that the children of the query and. You just put a few of them.

193
00:30:43,97 --> 00:30:50,18
Can't recall any special. One but there are a lot of youngsters.

194
00:30:50,18 --> 00:30:55,83
And there's a lot of youngsters who who have done well for themselves too and there's a lot that haven't hit

195
00:30:55,83 --> 00:31:05,05
and who don't want to. You know that age group. When they happen to live on the street.

196
00:31:05,05 --> 00:31:09,94
Call themselves straight kids but the biggest majority of their parents live here in here.

197
00:31:09,94 --> 00:31:18,71
So i don't believe that there's even call a street kid a street kid if they parents leave in a year you think they've

198
00:31:18,71 --> 00:31:33,86
got parents that's what that should be. I mean you know. So i had to i judge.
