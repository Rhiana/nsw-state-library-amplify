1
00:00:16,64 --> 00:00:17,92
I could take all day.

2
00:00:17,92 --> 00:00:32,21
It's tuesday the seventeenth of the then the no need i need to weigh in and speaking with larry king. And i was very.

3
00:00:32,21 --> 00:00:40,42
Bargained around. The battery. Be working out in him and. For the last three years. In an informal manner.

4
00:00:40,42 --> 00:00:43,48
And formally. For the last four months.

5
00:00:44,08 --> 00:00:50,05
Being axed by the oldest and indorsed by the oldest to get certain projects happening in naman

6
00:00:50,05 --> 00:01:01,74
and particular a bunch a long way in which and. Community activities within them been in the culture.

7
00:01:04,1 --> 00:01:21,26
I have if i just city. You know. When you think of a number that comes from word. Number one which is the hairy people.

8
00:01:21,26 --> 00:01:36,58
Of a country and. Prior to that number. Who was a great a number a very wise man.

9
00:01:36,58 --> 00:01:49,08
That does what every people have always been in this country. From time immemorial. And they were here.

10
00:01:49,08 --> 00:01:58,67
When the beigel post arrived. That's the dark skinned people. We're talking about by evil. And i landed at evan tate.

11
00:01:58,67 --> 00:02:04,26
There was another landing also at jamba. But this particular one that.

12
00:02:04,26 --> 00:02:16,18
Evans had the bagel landed there and begin the process of settlement. Within this country and they came across.

13
00:02:16,33 --> 00:02:27,34
The name on people at blue not that anybody. Which was a holy place in one. Jackie. School cycle.

14
00:02:29,54 --> 00:02:40,6
And a war then erupted between the people. And the bible. And june the war.

15
00:02:40,6 --> 00:02:51,24
People were pushed back down to the coast and. Tradition was then formed. Whereas the children. Of the beigel.

16
00:02:51,24 --> 00:03:07,06
Who had certain leanings towards healing. Were taken to members and were then shall and. The healing sciences and.

17
00:03:07,06 --> 00:03:16,75
Medicinal herbal use each and. Sacred law. And they were then taken back down to their people.

18
00:03:16,75 --> 00:03:30,88
The bottle to instruct them in the. Immanuel was always a place for spirituality and healing. They should. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:03:30,88 --> 00:03:44,21
From an image that tells a bit. What with a lot of very gentle people there were vegetarian people.

20
00:03:44,21 --> 00:03:55,64
They had on in jail. And like i said they've been here for a long time there are places. Underground places.

21
00:03:55,64 --> 00:04:09,33
The sacred places. Of crystals of metals of healing places. And power places. They were taught by the anybody.

22
00:04:09,33 --> 00:04:25,35
What was the significance that there was. Learnings within the rocks themselves on. Things are put to pass.

23
00:04:25,35 --> 00:04:32,63
That still say new schools. It's sort of like a movie projector. I mean.

24
00:04:32,63 --> 00:04:43,00
I can sit down and look at bubble gali which is a big the big rock. The first one. That scene from news mall and.

25
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:50,07
That is a chines the. Sculptures this oil paintings. Is photographs there is. It's a like a movie.

26
00:04:50,07 --> 00:04:56,31
You can sit there and just watch a movie. If you say like from sunup to sundown.

27
00:04:56,31 --> 00:05:03,51
And you can see the faces of figures that are animals that are different. The european.

28
00:05:05,1 --> 00:05:10,28
And if i can see those things and i'm not the only one who have seen them.

29
00:05:10,28 --> 00:05:16,18
Things in the rock they don't lose nations because they're created by natural causes. But light and shade.

30
00:05:16,18 --> 00:05:25,62
And by texture. And so i want to someone so they're not listening. You know. And you know they're not under any.

31
00:05:25,62 --> 00:05:34,22
Mushrooms or or anything like that. You know this seed with a with a with a clear bright. With clear eyes and.

32
00:05:34,22 --> 00:05:37,08
If i could see the. Those things in the rock.

33
00:05:37,33 --> 00:05:43,37
I know for sure and as a fact that the l people also saw what was in those rocks.

34
00:05:43,37 --> 00:05:51,17
And it was no surprise to them when the european. People came into the country. That they recognized their faces.

35
00:05:51,17 --> 00:06:05,08
And the animals. So some people say that in this. You know. When you know when it's a place with a prospect.

36
00:06:05,08 --> 00:06:11,66
Can you tell us all. While nim been for a start wasn't a place where people went out there to settle full time.

37
00:06:11,66 --> 00:06:20,52
While none of the old people did anyway. The war was in a state of movement. Moving around the country.

38
00:06:20,52 --> 00:06:28,78
You know it was pretty boring. To stay in one place. You know you sort of.

39
00:06:28,78 --> 00:06:35,35
It wasn't buying a half acre and having to pay off the bank. For the rest your feet life or.

40
00:06:35,35 --> 00:06:38,5
You know it was free to go and move wherever they wanted.

41
00:06:38,5 --> 00:06:42,4
And the fact that neighborhood was is that people went out there for specific purposes.

42
00:06:42,4 --> 00:06:49,74
And that might take two years it might take three years for whatever purpose that was needed for them in their

43
00:06:49,74 --> 00:06:57,08
development. Of exploration within themselves you know. Of human power. Or human abilities.

44
00:06:57,08 --> 00:07:02,12
Not so much power but human abilities. And knowledge. And like i said that could happen.

45
00:07:02,58 --> 00:07:08,65
You know six months it could happen in two years in three years could happen in four yes.

46
00:07:08,65 --> 00:07:11,03
But you know then you moved on.

47
00:07:11,03 --> 00:07:16,06
You know there were other places to explore there were other places to get knowledge from.

48
00:07:16,06 --> 00:07:21,54
And there were places that they would in the area where. Where the women didn't go.

49
00:07:21,54 --> 00:07:29,12
And not because that they were exempt from that place is because of the ability of the women

50
00:07:29,12 --> 00:07:36,11
and their sensitivity to be have all to receive this knowledge and the power of these places.

51
00:07:36,11 --> 00:07:46,49
From a distance that there was no need for them to go inside them. Or to go up to them. That was the men's business.

52
00:07:46,49 --> 00:07:51,94
In that act of penetration or of confrontation.

53
00:07:51,94 --> 00:07:59,65
The women had no need for that they received their full potency and power from a distance. Because that's their nature.

54
00:07:59,65 --> 00:08:11,61
That's their sensitivity. So tell us a bit about that you both to be able the way you. Would you buy gold.

55
00:08:11,61 --> 00:08:21,31
The children to buy gold with them. Because when they were given the title. Away and. By the numbers. What was there.

56
00:08:21,31 --> 00:08:30,25
To heal and to teach sacred law. To the bible. Which is the knowledge of the earth.

57
00:08:30,25 --> 00:08:37,78
That's a little and by god knew the law they knew the status the eye came from the sea.

58
00:08:37,78 --> 00:08:46,48
They were quite familiar with the stars and with the sky dreams and. Of the sacred law in this country is.

59
00:08:46,48 --> 00:08:54,64
Knowledge of the lad. That's sacred. In this sickness country.

60
00:08:54,64 --> 00:09:02,15
Yes but what a sickness country is a country where you got to work to get rid of your sickness and.

61
00:09:02,15 --> 00:09:04,37
That's anywhere in the country.

62
00:09:04,37 --> 00:09:08,74
With a certain there is a designated sickness country that's not a place where you've got to get sick.

63
00:09:09,7 --> 00:09:17,15
It's a place where you take a sickness to get rid of it because they areas within the country that have that power.

64
00:09:17,15 --> 00:09:29,34
To take that sickness from you and dissipate it through the land. Because of that. It's true that in their tracks.

65
00:09:29,34 --> 00:09:32,59
People. That's something you have to heal.

66
00:09:32,59 --> 00:09:37,87
Well yeah it is a heavy sickness was out there in the middle of the mountain. You know there's big.

67
00:09:37,87 --> 00:09:42,19
Drug abuse problems. I'm talking about drug abuse i'm talking about drugs.

68
00:09:42,19 --> 00:09:47,17
People i'm talking to use drugs if they wish that. With proper knowledge.

69
00:09:47,55 --> 00:09:50,19
But if you don't have a problem knowledge of drugs well you just.

70
00:09:50,19 --> 00:09:54,05
Drug abuse and so there's drug abuse going on at the moment.

71
00:09:54,29 --> 00:09:58,12
That's because of the draconian methods of the government and the state.

72
00:09:58,12 --> 00:10:05,14
Loopholes that people are getting sicker and sicker. Because of a such a low.

73
00:10:05,14 --> 00:10:09,33
It's not because of the law of the land the land is ailing all the time.

74
00:10:09,33 --> 00:10:22,62
But if you have a social situation where a plant. Actually growing. Planet from the sea is apple and made illegal.

75
00:10:22,62 --> 00:10:31,81
And it's the base of carol one. Trade and. Criminal activities within them than the law has to be changed.

76
00:10:31,81 --> 00:10:34,55
That's a social law. And it's killing the people.

77
00:10:34,55 --> 00:11:00,35
The laws of this land killing the people of the land is on the way and now. It's the sickness. Of it.

78
00:11:00,35 --> 00:11:04,84
Sorry i was going to go but what we have to. I think what we have to get danny to tim.

79
00:11:04,84 --> 00:11:21,66
Is the people's ability to look for culture. People's ability to come in contact and to learn. A culture that has laws.

80
00:11:21,66 --> 00:11:25,34
And this is a problem must been in this country for a long time.

81
00:11:25,34 --> 00:11:38,25
Is that they were people who've come from european descent who find it very hard to come to terms with certain laws.

82
00:11:38,25 --> 00:11:44,84
Now they were say in him and for resistance. There are people who are interested in bundjalung. Culture.

83
00:11:44,84 --> 00:11:51,09
They're interested in finding out what the l people did prior to invasion.

84
00:11:51,57 --> 00:11:55,93
The condition that was here in the country prior to invasion was vastly different.

85
00:11:55,93 --> 00:12:05,97
To the condition that has been in this country for the last two hundred g.'s. Now that's with so-called tribal law.

86
00:12:05,97 --> 00:12:22,46
The law in this country. Had to be strict. Any civilization that's under. Attack. Or invasion. Tighten up. The laws.

87
00:12:22,46 --> 00:12:27,42
They introduce martial law. So this country is being in a sense.

88
00:12:27,42 --> 00:12:32,88
Under a form of martial law for the last two hundred g.'s. And so some people take it as being that.

89
00:12:32,88 --> 00:12:38,73
This is aboriginal culture. That these are the laws of the aboriginal people here they owe.

90
00:12:38,73 --> 00:12:42,86
Of course a lot of the aboriginal people. But they are the laws that want.

91
00:12:42,86 --> 00:12:48,55
They're not the laws that we hear two hundred years ago prior to one. Yes they were different.

92
00:12:48,55 --> 00:12:55,08
There was no need for a lot of the laws that are now within. Aboriginal society or culture.

93
00:12:56,12 --> 00:13:05,86
But even so that there were still people who have no wish for. Laws. You know if.

94
00:13:05,86 --> 00:13:13,76
Some women were told by the elders or by kore people that women are not supposed to go up to the rocks.

95
00:13:14,67 --> 00:13:27,02
What do you get. You get groups of women. Going up to the rocks off the able to say. You can't go there.

96
00:13:27,02 --> 00:13:31,48
And what do you know. Before you know it. You've got picnic this.

97
00:13:31,48 --> 00:13:37,23
And you've got people on my she's going to those places. Because by sickly they were told not to go there.

98
00:13:37,69 --> 00:13:44,91
So this is a state of lawlessness. People to tell the law. And for very good reason.

99
00:13:44,91 --> 00:13:51,46
And so people deliberately go out of their way to go and break the law. So if people are going to have that attitude.

100
00:13:51,46 --> 00:14:00,44
There's a lot of the elders are not happy with that attitude that if they tell people something about the culture

101
00:14:00,44 --> 00:14:06,82
and about the laws of the land because these of the laws from the land and the law comes from the land.

102
00:14:06,82 --> 00:14:12,37
Doesn't come from the people. Is transmitted by the people. So if the. You know the land. The.

103
00:14:12,37 --> 00:14:20,67
The laws of the land atol to people in the people don't wish to have any. And the respect for that.

104
00:14:20,67 --> 00:14:24,2
Well i just lose respect in the eyes of the able to settle

105
00:14:24,2 --> 00:14:29,96
and so you find a situation where the old is just man talk about any such thing because they can see that these people

106
00:14:29,96 --> 00:14:33,53
are really not interested in lord all. They're not really interested in culture.

107
00:14:33,53 --> 00:14:47,03
They're by simply just interested in power than if they were bright this was something evil said to me i think. So yes.

108
00:14:47,03 --> 00:14:53,19
Well people curse themselves by neglecting and by disregarding the laws that were given by the elders and why.

109
00:14:53,19 --> 00:14:56,51
You know that curse doesn't come from the elders or from the people at all.

110
00:14:56,51 --> 00:15:02,2
I certainly didn't go around cursing people. You know people have respect there's no need to curse.

111
00:15:03,11 --> 00:15:05,85
It's only when those people have disrespect that they curse themselves.

112
00:15:06,72 --> 00:15:09,38
You know is personal responsibility we're talking about here.

113
00:15:09,38 --> 00:15:14,62
And that's a very strong mind stay within the party culture. Is personal responsibility for your actions.

114
00:15:14,62 --> 00:15:21,45
And if you don't have responsibility for your actions where you are cursed. You do that to yourself. No one else.

115
00:15:21,45 --> 00:15:25,45
No one else is the guy for that. You know the land has a slow.

116
00:15:25,45 --> 00:15:36,87
And if you wish to transgress those laws or to dis disregard them. Well you're cursing yourself. That's all.

117
00:15:36,87 --> 00:15:42,86
And you know it's been it's people it's it's people have disregard the laws of the cursing themselves with poisoned

118
00:15:42,86 --> 00:15:47,69
water. You know the cursing themselves with the with the hate from the.

119
00:15:47,69 --> 00:15:51,69
Cutting down of the rain forest or the cursing themselves with putting cattle on the.

120
00:15:51,69 --> 00:16:01,43
The cursing themselves with the poisons in their foods. The cursing themselves. People not cursing them for that.

121
00:16:01,43 --> 00:16:20,58
In the story of writing this. Well the rainbow serpent is like up a snake. Yes i'm telling but.

122
00:16:20,58 --> 00:16:29,88
And that's a piece of the rainbow serpent. And bought a cop it's like about one in the same and.

123
00:16:29,88 --> 00:16:38,59
That was a very strong center for the brain by snake dreaming in the newman valley. It's crystals.

124
00:16:38,59 --> 00:16:48,28
Because they cycle to group of rambus like the crystal. In the moon and. So that was another place where.

125
00:16:48,28 --> 00:16:58,98
Like i said with a healing. For all forms of feeling that comes under the carpet snake of rambus night.

126
00:16:58,98 --> 00:17:10,18
All of these things that you telling me. Interesting stories. Nothing's changed. No you know. They can change.

127
00:17:10,18 --> 00:17:25,43
The dreaming is can be added to by stick with the story remains the same. But they can be added to.

128
00:17:25,43 --> 00:17:34,68
They can be given another perspective. Because it was so many. You've got three sixty three sixty degrees.

129
00:17:34,68 --> 00:17:42,68
And you can take any one of those paths. But whatever path you take. There's a dreaming story for that.

130
00:17:42,68 --> 00:17:49,55
Because the al people have gone on that path some time people throughout the history of this country.

131
00:17:49,55 --> 00:17:53,42
People have been there. That being and i've done that.

132
00:17:53,42 --> 00:17:57,14
So i would nothing has really changed in this country as far as like us.

133
00:17:57,14 --> 00:18:06,76
Because no matter where you go in this country. It's been walked before someone had been. Along that same track.

134
00:18:06,76 --> 00:18:14,8
But your following. So in other words. There's already been someone i hate of you who has been.

135
00:18:14,8 --> 00:18:20,35
So you're just following there try. No matter where you go.

136
00:18:20,35 --> 00:18:28,00
And i'm not just talking about like human form but a good homosapien for. You know in a totem way. You know.

137
00:18:28,00 --> 00:18:31,38
Totem your totem. As being that way.

138
00:18:31,38 --> 00:18:39,84
You know we never visit for ordinates night for morning that booed from the waterfall. You've been there.

139
00:18:39,84 --> 00:18:45,23
You've been through that way before. Nothing has changed.

140
00:18:45,23 --> 00:18:59,25
So it's no surprise to hear that with this sort of people taking the ideas that had been there before.

141
00:18:59,25 --> 00:19:05,92
There is the dreaming stories like i was saying with the. Beigel people and with the nimble people and.

142
00:19:05,92 --> 00:19:19,21
That's still occurring. That's still happening. And there is a. There's a happy ending. There's a happy ending to it.

143
00:19:19,21 --> 00:19:26,95
If people like as if people want to learn the culture. And i want to learn the language. Now the language.

144
00:19:26,95 --> 00:19:34,38
In the name of the area. And up in the bunch and miria. As being given the go ahead by the old has to be taught and.

145
00:19:34,38 --> 00:19:42,18
They teaching it. So the language needs to go out and when people start learning the language of the land.

146
00:19:42,18 --> 00:19:58,46
The indigenous language. They then automatically. Have a deed. To the land. As far as their standing. Of that land.

147
00:19:58,46 --> 00:20:05,96
You speak the language. You're bundjalung. Which you're speaking the language. You speaking bundjalung.

148
00:20:05,96 --> 00:20:13,42
Which and you learn in the language. You learn in the dremiel in the significance of the language.

149
00:20:13,42 --> 00:20:23,4
Because the language gives a specific. References to the cycle places. And what they mean. I can talk.

150
00:20:23,4 --> 00:20:30,59
And explain things in english until my face goes blue. But in that the.

151
00:20:30,59 --> 00:20:35,18
If you learn by angela than i talk to you when bundled with a old as a talking to you when you learn.

152
00:20:35,18 --> 00:20:47,16
You get the full import of one word. What. The other influences. On the spirit level. On the earth level.

153
00:20:47,16 --> 00:21:00,05
In the water level. On all of these things. So that gives do. A sort of like a deed. Of sharing. The lane and.

154
00:21:00,05 --> 00:21:08,15
It's called. Nothing which is alice. Then it becomes alice. Not yours and mine.

155
00:21:08,15 --> 00:21:16,47
Which is the situation that exists now and. It's very important to learn the language. So people listening to this.

156
00:21:16,47 --> 00:21:23,94
Talk or whatever that. If they can make an effort to learn the language of their local area.

157
00:21:23,94 --> 00:21:31,54
And to approach the people in the old is. For that and. And to keep that culture and language.

158
00:21:31,54 --> 00:21:37,16
Happening within their communities. As it is up here in the bundjalung.

159
00:21:37,16 --> 00:21:48,24
There won't be as much confusion about land rights. Because it comes from the rights of the land the land has rights.

160
00:21:48,24 --> 00:22:02,12
These are the lns rights. People the human beings. The human dreaming. Is to maintain.

161
00:22:02,12 --> 00:22:07,87
And to respect the laws of the land and. The rights of building.

162
00:22:08,06 --> 00:22:18,78
And if people don't enforce or if they show a lack of interest in the lands rights. Well we all die.

163
00:22:18,78 --> 00:22:29,92
That's as simple as that. Because the land. Is the low and no human being is greater than the law.

164
00:22:45,36 --> 00:22:53,16
Well there was a tradition of people coming from far and wide from the far reaches of this continent coming to him

165
00:22:53,16 --> 00:22:56,69
and for giving. Given out ability to fly.

166
00:22:59,03 --> 00:23:04,53
Now people can interpret as all sorts of things that would have a physical process of the talking about

167
00:23:04,53 --> 00:23:21,89
when they say fly. Well yes. We all people did. Physically move through the. But that was a time back then.

168
00:23:21,89 --> 00:23:30,92
That was a time back that..

169
00:23:24,22 --> 00:23:30,14
There's different ways to move through the and now with it having to balance up and down on your pointy like t.m.

170
00:23:33,32 --> 00:23:40,91
Sorry my age. But you know like there's other ways. There's other means to fly through the air.

171
00:23:40,91 --> 00:23:42,55
I mean people can do that physically now

172
00:23:42,55 --> 00:23:51,89
when he went through you know what planes all through with flying a car to whatever you know doing doing stuff like

173
00:23:51,89 --> 00:24:03,76
that. I mean that's the people that sal down the rock. And so on and so on. That's done physically.

174
00:24:03,76 --> 00:24:09,14
What was some of the others. Secrets. There is nothing.

175
00:24:09,14 --> 00:24:21,66
Right for us to just say we're talking about this two hundred year period

176
00:24:21,66 --> 00:24:30,58
when the old people had no need as such for specific people. To take care of their healing.

177
00:24:30,58 --> 00:24:38,16
And to have responsibility for someone else's health. I mean that.

178
00:24:38,16 --> 00:24:42,01
That was everyone's responsibility for their own health in the way. And the way that was.

179
00:24:42,19 --> 00:24:49,47
That the al people lead their lifestyle any way excluded. Sickness. And so on.

180
00:24:49,47 --> 00:25:00,7
And if people do come down with a sickness. Is that the. You know there was a family. Remedies. Plant knowledge.

181
00:25:00,7 --> 00:25:06,12
Where they can just go and fix themselves up by a feeling a little bit to have sorts. Or stuff of.

182
00:25:06,12 --> 00:25:12,52
Nothing major but within this to want to do period because of the sickness that did come to this land.

183
00:25:12,52 --> 00:25:19,7
There were people who were specialized who had to become specialized. And so.

184
00:25:19,7 --> 00:25:26,02
Look i'm saying with this martial law business. Now there were people who specifically became warriors.

185
00:25:26,02 --> 00:25:33,91
People who specifically. Were designated we and. Some who specifically designated. Other tasks.

186
00:25:36,02 --> 00:25:43,53
Because like i said it was oppressive times and. People were concerned with just surviving.

187
00:25:45,42 --> 00:25:55,66
So there were people who who were given the tasks of being custody. Of certain knowledge is. So i wanted to tell.

188
00:25:55,66 --> 00:26:03,7
Because the majority of people were concerned with with surviving. With with hiding. And running.

189
00:26:07,75 --> 00:26:13,59
So it's a tradition not smallest. It has been amplified i lost only g.'s.

190
00:26:13,59 --> 00:26:29,54
With certain people were given the training for healing is that story as it has a happy ending how do you think about

191
00:26:29,54 --> 00:26:37,24
what you think i had a strong faith in him and people in him and will.

192
00:26:37,24 --> 00:26:42,01
Well i already have i'm in this situation know that in the last twenty years where people were exploring.

193
00:26:42,3 --> 00:26:52,02
Time day of dealing with. Alternative thinking. And methods of war to the powers and. And so on it's own. You know so.

194
00:26:52,02 --> 00:26:58,63
That's a happy story. Sometimes it wasn't the same as this in the dreaming story. Where the people were taken.

195
00:26:58,63 --> 00:27:10,41
Who are app costs by sickly from the invading people and they were taken by a to newman and they were taught.

196
00:27:10,41 --> 00:27:22,16
Medicine and. Toward healing. To take back down to their people. And so i could law. You know given the sacred law.

197
00:27:22,16 --> 00:27:31,16
And things like that. To to take to the people to heal them to fix them. You know. To say that.

198
00:27:31,16 --> 00:27:38,19
You know it's going to be all right. You know like don't panic. The human spirit is the most resilient.

199
00:27:38,19 --> 00:27:45,97
Thing in the universe. Place. Yeah. Sounds good right.
