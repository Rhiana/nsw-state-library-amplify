1
00:00:13,37 --> 00:00:20,87
You and the toilet people immediately just because in the ground. That's very difficult to get people.

2
00:00:20,87 --> 00:00:27,6
Once i start doing that to something which is more appropriate. And says i. Drug costs.

3
00:00:27,6 --> 00:00:32,89
And i use holes in the ground for toilets and. Carry water up from the creek in buckets.

4
00:00:32,89 --> 00:00:45,57
And that once people achieve that. Bottom level of servicing. Then i just sort of don't see the need to progress again.

5
00:00:49,82 --> 00:00:53,57
So that's exactly what happens a cycle of poverty.

6
00:00:55,62 --> 00:01:03,32
The lack of servicing means that all people's time and if it is used up. Keeping inefficient. Services going.

7
00:01:03,32 --> 00:01:14,35
Rather than. Possibly. Collectivizing. And making more efficiency and it can be actively destructive.

8
00:01:14,35 --> 00:01:19,71
The lack of organization of services for example is one part in the property where there are six water pipes.

9
00:01:19,71 --> 00:01:30,09
All tied together and big bundle. All running to different places. Because no one trusts. To shia pop with anyone else.

10
00:01:30,09 --> 00:01:35,33
With good reason historically. Because the quickest and easiest way of getting.

11
00:01:35,33 --> 00:01:39,16
Getting back at united for any reason is to cut their water off.

12
00:01:39,16 --> 00:01:53,36
And that causes and they jerk reaction and somebody said that would a cut off. Which is fall and. So. Yes.

13
00:01:53,36 --> 00:02:04,09
I decided no why they were going to do any. Efficient implementation of soft. So the same technology. Vaught.

14
00:02:04,09 --> 00:02:09,58
Communities. The didn't seem to be the degree of trust or resolve or capital.

15
00:02:10,14 --> 00:02:15,44
And as well as that wasn't the quality of the gear they all had to build itself and it was like backyard

16
00:02:15,44 --> 00:02:21,37
and people never trusted it. Or else you had to pay for commercial stuff which is fast we have a priced.

17
00:02:22,57 --> 00:02:29,42
So we decided that the real bottleneck in the implementation of soft earth friendly technology was the commercial

18
00:02:29,42 --> 00:02:38,25
sector. So we decided well. If you can't beat them join them. And we set up a company. To resell at reasonable prices.

19
00:02:38,25 --> 00:02:43,43
And also to manufacture. Or are quite cold technological missing links.

20
00:02:43,43 --> 00:02:50,86
Key things which you need to make a system up right and which you can't buy. And also to get. Purchasing power.

21
00:02:50,86 --> 00:02:57,05
Because it's a very strange world out there in the market. We think that a free market.

22
00:02:57,05 --> 00:03:04,2
And anyone's money is as good as anyone else. But it doesn't work like that. Refusal to. Deal as almost.

23
00:03:04,2 --> 00:03:10,58
The rule not the exception when you come to to buying technological things. And with the top will.

24
00:03:10,58 --> 00:03:16,12
And respectable incorporation of running up our company we found that we had a lot more credibility and buying power.

25
00:03:16,12 --> 00:03:23,6
We could suddenly buy a lot cheaper. And we could get. Get people to sell us things and give us information that.

26
00:03:23,6 --> 00:03:29,74
As individual uprightness was impossible. Because us as becky. He invented.

27
00:03:29,74 --> 00:03:34,56
You've got absolutely no status in this community. Once you've got a business card.

28
00:03:34,56 --> 00:03:40,33
People treat you like you're on the same planet and. That was the main reason that we did it.

29
00:03:40,33 --> 00:03:46,06
And it worked amazingly well. It's like the two societies. An invisible one within the big one.

30
00:03:46,06 --> 00:03:50,41
An invisible one within the big one. It's the people with. Business clout.

31
00:03:50,41 --> 00:03:57,9
With money with respectability who are financially operating. As against the drop out. Inverted commas.

32
00:03:57,9 --> 00:04:09,58
People who are considered as nobodies because they haven't got enough money or political power. Which i guess.

33
00:04:10,38 --> 00:04:22,41
The verse you invented. Bicycles with retitling retiling kicked it all off the been a few people running.

34
00:04:22,41 --> 00:04:29,62
Market stalls. Someone from the co-op and and. Peter from websters creek and. He wasn't actually living there then.

35
00:04:29,62 --> 00:04:38,6
But the people staying during stalls selling things like efficient light bulbs torches. Bits of appropriate technology.

36
00:04:38,6 --> 00:04:48,93
At that the markets. Because the china market was an amazing. Focus of entrepreneurship. And. Appropriate technology.

37
00:04:48,93 --> 00:04:54,15
Was one of the things that went along with that market format. And that's what started the idea of buying and selling.

38
00:04:54,15 --> 00:05:03,71
As a business. And peter had been doing that and i've been doing that. And. Caroline he registered to business.

39
00:05:03,71 --> 00:05:09,11
Sun source. Which is doing the same thing she was buying and selling solar panels. And this buying and selling.

40
00:05:09,11 --> 00:05:17,31
As a way of generating money and getting contacts. Had an obvious. Escalation which was to set up a company.

41
00:05:17,31 --> 00:05:33,08
And that's what happened to you and us. Yeah. Second year i was here i think actually built. First water which worked.

42
00:05:33,08 --> 00:05:38,46
And didn't work very well because it was to keep wearing out drop belts.

43
00:05:38,46 --> 00:05:47,02
That actually produced a useful amount of electricity that it. Actually sat in the creek. And used to get wet.

44
00:05:47,02 --> 00:05:50,39
The drive belt used to slip. And the thing used to wear out.

45
00:05:50,91 --> 00:05:57,84
And also had big political problems with it because there was a an anti technology.

46
00:05:57,84 --> 00:06:07,01
Feeling he had a lot ot mentality and also. I tried to get through the correct processes of getting.

47
00:06:07,01 --> 00:06:09,58
Co-operative endorsement. Of these energy projects.

48
00:06:10,71 --> 00:06:18,77
But all the while i actually got that endorsement for most of the things i did. I actually rise to flag.

49
00:06:18,77 --> 00:06:24,8
And attracted attention from a lot about minorities actually stoned broke interfered with and destroyed.

50
00:06:24,8 --> 00:06:33,92
A lot of the early projects which i put together. And i sort of interference with the spirits of the creek. So.

51
00:06:33,92 --> 00:06:39,51
I'd lot of trouble for the first few years. Eventually i learned my lesson.

52
00:06:39,51 --> 00:06:44,68
And stopped going through the clear correct political process is because they.

53
00:06:44,68 --> 00:06:52,14
Got in the wind they drew thought this is a growing use of got this mindset. When something becomes. Media worthy.

54
00:06:53,66 --> 00:07:02,17
Then it's. Protest worthy and. Whether it's in the newspaper in issue. Or whether it's in the local. Cooperative.

55
00:07:03,14 --> 00:07:09,67
Trouble meetings in issue. It still draws far. And you get a protest movement mobilizing for it and psych and.

56
00:07:09,67 --> 00:07:13,03
Most of the people involved in these things have got minimal understanding.

57
00:07:13,03 --> 00:07:20,58
They tend to be very stupid reactive people. And so i was up against the the most silly extreme group of.

58
00:07:20,58 --> 00:07:27,92
Greenies do it as. As a wife self empowerment. And basically just. Against everything on principle.

59
00:07:27,92 --> 00:07:32,34
And then they turn around and act as total hypocrites from the goodies some of the mainstream.

60
00:07:32,34 --> 00:07:36,55
Technology for their income for. Any white.

61
00:07:36,55 --> 00:07:40,81
How i bitch about the extreme greenies in the early days of this cooperative it was.

62
00:07:40,81 --> 00:07:48,4
It was very rational and very emotional. And my first big technology success. I actually did. Without telling anyone.

63
00:07:48,4 --> 00:07:55,77
With my own money. And my own initiative and bought a great pulse still cable strung it up the cliff.

64
00:07:55,77 --> 00:08:02,62
And put an electric motor on the top and. Created the first. Petrol powered transport system in the whole place.

65
00:08:02,62 --> 00:08:09,58
Which is still working to this diet. Which i think is eighteen years later. I think that's an amazing achievement. And.

66
00:08:09,7 --> 00:08:14,86
It means that i can live. Along with my neighboring four houses without any right access.

67
00:08:14,86 --> 00:08:18,3
We just have a steel cable coming up a two hundred foot cliff.

68
00:08:18,3 --> 00:08:26,79
Is being a very appropriate pace of technology that still lived till you do well just the systems.

69
00:08:26,79 --> 00:08:33,48
Because that's audiology that we didn't want to connect in one more. And it was full size.

70
00:08:33,48 --> 00:08:40,26
Legalities we didn't want to attract. Yet another government authority. To us and.

71
00:08:40,26 --> 00:08:47,91
We wanted to prove that alternatives were possible. So. I built two more water will be for one of actually worked and.

72
00:08:47,91 --> 00:08:51,74
It actually ran for five years before it got. Devastated an enormous flood.

73
00:08:52,24 --> 00:08:57,03
The will itself didn't get broken but the dam across the creek did.

74
00:08:57,03 --> 00:09:05,41
So those limited success with water powered machines at that stage. A little bit lighter i put up a. Recycled windmill.

75
00:09:05,41 --> 00:09:15,16
And that's still working. So there was a bit of sporadic want to off. Successes with energy projects.

76
00:09:15,16 --> 00:09:20,95
But i could see that my life was going to end before many more one else were completed. So i thought that.

77
00:09:20,95 --> 00:09:26,56
Getting commercial. And getting big. And getting messed production was the only way to have any real major impact.

78
00:09:26,56 --> 00:09:33,95
So it would have been a great life and. You know. Yes what's the same thing. Yeah.

79
00:09:35,34 --> 00:09:44,84
So we basically just did in a nor similar commercial why what we did already proved it worked.

80
00:09:44,84 --> 00:09:55,71
So strong that we don't know if it's all yours.

81
00:09:55,71 --> 00:10:00,47
So we did some interesting experimentation with different sorts of generators.

82
00:10:00,47 --> 00:10:05,14
And we actually if we did that fundamental research.

83
00:10:05,14 --> 00:10:12,33
That was necessary to to make things work better than the competition. And we still. We started with no money.

84
00:10:12,33 --> 00:10:17,3
And with no preconceptions this result. Got to a different type of design.

85
00:10:17,3 --> 00:10:30,73
Which works better in smaller sauces than anything on the market tells you how. I do magical idea of living it.

86
00:10:30,73 --> 00:10:40,82
Close it tonight. Without interfering with it. Hundred african genesis by adria like the idea of living in forest.

87
00:10:41,5 --> 00:10:46,87
I hated the thing i detested most about the suburban not man.

88
00:10:46,87 --> 00:10:52,66
So i pledged i would build a house somewhere where i did not have to have a loan. So.

89
00:10:52,66 --> 00:11:00,62
I actually picked a place of totally. Standard. Ordinary eucalypt forest. Which had reasonable access.

90
00:11:00,62 --> 00:11:02,14
Want to put this kind of a lot.

91
00:11:02,58 --> 00:11:10,01
I didn't have to fight any territorial wars with anyone else who wanted to the land all the water all the excess of

92
00:11:10,01 --> 00:11:16,74
something like that. So i was a totally ordinary enormous sot in the middle of an australian mountain range.

93
00:11:16,74 --> 00:11:22,44
And i built a house there. The house was defined very much by the thought it had to be fought proof.

94
00:11:22,44 --> 00:11:28,91
Had to be proof against falling timber. It had to be cheap. It had to be. Might now it's free.

95
00:11:28,91 --> 00:11:32,43
And when i didn't have to protect with nasty chemicals or with chancel.

96
00:11:32,43 --> 00:11:37,12
So then you on the fitted the bill perfectly was a dime.

97
00:11:37,44 --> 00:11:40,55
I don't want been interested in dimes because of the structural elegance.

98
00:11:40,55 --> 00:11:44,44
The use for little materials and free high strength and.

99
00:11:44,44 --> 00:11:49,52
One wind which we can use less of the earth's resources just use more efficient structures.

100
00:11:49,52 --> 00:11:52,09
Like my house twice ten tonnes.

101
00:11:52,09 --> 00:11:52,9
That might sound a lot

102
00:11:52,9 --> 00:11:58,62
but your average brick veneer house with a fraction of the strength wise about ten times that amount. So.

103
00:11:59,75 --> 00:12:06,98
And the environmental impact was there. It was measurable. The thing was made of cement and steel.

104
00:12:06,98 --> 00:12:11,04
But you've got a definite environmental impact. It's not pretty. You'll be bad.

105
00:12:11,04 --> 00:12:16,71
If you look at the last cycle impact of that technology. And a small amount of the dough used. So.

106
00:12:16,71 --> 00:12:27,09
It was basically just a demonstration of living. Soft impact housing. No.

107
00:12:27,09 --> 00:12:30,87
Hug no them and let me listen both in that mike why if you don't drool file.

108
00:12:31,76 --> 00:12:40,01
So i went to all the right moves with a cooperative. I even put in a picture of it to the building inspector.

109
00:12:40,01 --> 00:12:41,91
Just the minimum. Application.

110
00:12:41,91 --> 00:12:46,66
I got the message back he didn't believe in diamonds and that was the end of it now for the correspondence

111
00:12:46,66 --> 00:12:51,96
and into until seven years later i suddenly discovered that all have become legal.

112
00:12:51,96 --> 00:12:58,46
But into being an existing structure. So that limits of like are about to fall on my side.

113
00:12:58,46 --> 00:13:05,19
But then we put in small planes and got the thing. Legitimist and us. Actually.

114
00:13:05,19 --> 00:13:10,43
Thanks to pull landa pass not ordinance seventy. But structural engineering testing.

115
00:13:10,43 --> 00:13:16,52
Which of course my house passed easily in fact i became part of the test flight. Most of them top of the.

116
00:13:16,52 --> 00:13:25,52
Ton of white on the weakest place. So that's a lot of fun. It was not feeling that slight amount of.

117
00:13:25,52 --> 00:13:35,48
Bureaucratic acceptability. All those different issues of the dime was too weak.

118
00:13:35,48 --> 00:13:41,00
This would irritate me so much about two hundred seventy it was not about strength. It's not about appropriateness.

119
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:43,82
It's not even about health. Was about code.

120
00:13:46,86 --> 00:13:53,02
And the fact that you've got the option to either get your structure passed by code or by engineering tests.

121
00:13:53,02 --> 00:14:12,61
I think is the why the world should be. Personal off with disastrous terribly lonely. Not living.

122
00:14:13,25 --> 00:14:15,5
I was living in one of the hamlets in the place.

123
00:14:15,5 --> 00:14:17,5
And we worked pretty much as a group and we got together

124
00:14:17,5 --> 00:14:29,71
and so on i became quite quite mad from sleeping alone for too many years. And there's an enormous shortage of women.

125
00:14:30,36 --> 00:14:39,62
And the ones that would tend to be attracted by people with more services of course. Not to lived on top of the cliff.

126
00:14:40,14 --> 00:14:49,79
That wasn't so much the trouble. It was really as a conflict between. Homestead is and free love hippies.

127
00:14:49,79 --> 00:14:55,61
And we had this both. Ideals. Side by side literally. Where you know.

128
00:14:55,61 --> 00:15:01,14
You get one lot of neighbors to be very morally vindictive about people sleeping around.

129
00:15:01,14 --> 00:15:04,83
And then you'd have next door people who didn't believe in marriage in the least.

130
00:15:04,83 --> 00:15:07,57
And if you try to possessive that was a heavy trip man.

131
00:15:08,37 --> 00:15:16,69
And i believe reality is sort of somewhere in between the two extremes. And i think that's where i was was.

132
00:15:16,69 --> 00:15:21,26
But i had a reputation as a terrible flandrau. Which i wasn't totally deserved.

133
00:15:22,02 --> 00:15:40,33
And i didn't make it as one of the bridges. This was. When you. Now. Yes. It's awful to a lot of reverse sexism.

134
00:15:40,33 --> 00:15:43,22
In this community. I don't know whether i was totally right.

135
00:15:43,22 --> 00:15:49,43
Plus it may be perceived that men were considered just extremely expendable. And trishna very mercenary white.

136
00:15:49,43 --> 00:15:59,13
Simply as house builder. You see. The role of a man in that utopian community was extremely ill defined.

137
00:16:00,61 --> 00:16:05,43
In many of the cases the women. Usurped the natural. Roles of men.

138
00:16:05,43 --> 00:16:12,25
I'm not complaining about that i think it's appropriate that i did. But the women were. Roles are extremely aggressive.

139
00:16:12,25 --> 00:16:18,89
Though totoro. Very much in their own pecking order. They were very interested in the minutes of the games.

140
00:16:19,63 --> 00:16:27,05
Men became very much also around us and their own uses whether they could produce food or. Build houses.

141
00:16:27,05 --> 00:16:32,71
They would have any financial use. Because women could get more much more money from other.

142
00:16:32,71 --> 00:16:42,73
Growing diaper or social security or even prostitution in a few cases. So many. Now use would have us financially.

143
00:16:42,73 --> 00:16:50,3
And once had built the hell so usually disposed of as well. And there's a shortage of women.

144
00:16:50,3 --> 00:16:54,67
Do a bit more menace is always been the case and yes drug and outback and.

145
00:16:54,67 --> 00:17:01,21
A lot of the women were coming from a situation of. Persecution. In fact.

146
00:17:01,21 --> 00:17:09,89
I think cynthia generalize that many women who ended up here. Were coming here to skype. Six just oppression.

147
00:17:09,89 --> 00:17:18,53
Balmain and men came here for audio list dick. Dreams of freedom and. And utopia.

148
00:17:19,35 --> 00:17:29,99
Women tend to come here to escape maine. And i think had a miserable time because back in suburbia. They got basically.

149
00:17:29,99 --> 00:17:37,34
Used financially by being under the thumb of men. Particularly when they had young kids.

150
00:17:37,34 --> 00:17:43,05
That came here to get a wife mean. And suddenly they could have their freedom. But then they found the tyranny.

151
00:17:43,05 --> 00:17:49,44
That they didn't have enough service situations. They missed that they missed their houses.

152
00:17:49,44 --> 00:17:55,66
And particularly when you got young kids. I think you need servicing more than ever you do. In your life.

153
00:17:56,9 --> 00:18:03,01
Suddenly all of the. The middle class values of. Flush toilets and cars and. Security and things like that.

154
00:18:03,01 --> 00:18:09,58
Become very important because you've got little kids. And that. That makes it a necessity.

155
00:18:10,42 --> 00:18:19,9
So many why what i was getting to i guess is that men were saying very much this is mostly rain. Contracts.

156
00:18:19,9 --> 00:18:26,52
And the game was. You build houses and fix cars. And you get to go to bed with me.

157
00:18:26,52 --> 00:18:30,15
And that was the why the social contract worked. And of course.

158
00:18:30,15 --> 00:18:32,26
There were many cardia lost a belief

159
00:18:32,26 --> 00:18:40,4
and so might some believed in equality of the sexes i believed in old a sort of lovely flowers child sort of stuff and.

160
00:18:40,4 --> 00:18:50,3
I was extremely hurt. To be taken as purely as a provider of the building. So i did a bit of. Building houses.

161
00:18:50,3 --> 00:18:56,79
And a bit of fixing people's water pipes and a lot of wiring people's houses and all sort of thing. But it seemed that.

162
00:18:56,79 --> 00:19:14,94
Sex in return for libel. Was it was unsatisfying emotionally. So it was and was not generally do. Much.

163
00:19:14,94 --> 00:19:21,28
And the wasn't masada keep falling in love with women. Was a terrible problem. And of course.

164
00:19:21,28 --> 00:19:24,45
Men are a nuisance particularly if they're in love with you.

165
00:19:24,45 --> 00:19:33,14
So i mean you try to make demands because your happiness is totally dependent upon getting in someone else's bed which

166
00:19:33,14 --> 00:19:45,88
i think the facile situation but that's the situation much most men found themselves. So. Well just like that.

167
00:19:45,88 --> 00:19:58,33
Get fall in love with people. Kept slipping a line. Kept feeling depressed. There's a socket whenever never again.

168
00:19:58,33 --> 00:20:09,58
Was there was a decision. You might consider more. Yes very strongly. It seemed like a bad joke.

169
00:20:10,77 --> 00:20:19,77
When i was after that fifteen years. You did less than that actually but twelve years of this.

170
00:20:20,7 --> 00:20:31,85
Was long enough to try out a lovely. Loft options. And the final option always want to children and.

171
00:20:31,85 --> 00:20:37,41
When i discovered that i store all anyway that was like the last bad joke.

172
00:20:40,92 --> 00:20:57,37
It seemed like a way of disposing of that whole problem area of my life i would do all we got dust up on whole months.

173
00:20:57,37 --> 00:21:12,94
That work unbelievably well. I recommend it for many. Depressive suicidal lovesick miles. It's worked. It's worked.

174
00:21:12,94 --> 00:21:25,98
It's solved that problem totally. Yes. It was a problem. So quite frankly i'd thought that was a problem.

175
00:21:25,98 --> 00:21:32,94
I didn't know them anything. I thought it was their problem to do with and it was not really a problem anyway.

176
00:21:32,94 --> 00:21:43,57
The whole thing was quite quite funny. How did you lose. Oh i get treated as bad.

177
00:21:43,57 --> 00:21:49,57
But then most people are treated as mad who live here anyway so what does that mean.

178
00:21:51,59 --> 00:21:55,27
It did for the worse and the credibility problem.

179
00:21:56,61 --> 00:22:02,44
I felt that i always had communication problems because i was being shouted down by a loud mouth people who repeated

180
00:22:02,44 --> 00:22:03,19
themselves ten times

181
00:22:03,19 --> 00:22:08,91
and got the why that was sort of like a syndrome which had been going ever since the beginning of the co-operative.

182
00:22:08,91 --> 00:22:14,42
I couldn't build. If my made it drop in status but i can't live untouchable compared with being a schoolteacher.

183
00:22:15,44 --> 00:22:17,72
I wasn't particular thora to the school teacher

184
00:22:17,72 --> 00:22:22,76
but all got christmas at least anyone who was coming he was a mediately suspect.

185
00:22:22,76 --> 00:22:32,92
Because also from the straight science community which is considered as a as a demonic religion. And i didn't ever.

186
00:22:32,92 --> 00:22:35,97
Doubt my principles of oracle stright science.

187
00:22:36,76 --> 00:22:41,87
Madea's of truth my belief structure i think is the why i put it now and never been under much threat and never

188
00:22:41,87 --> 00:22:49,21
and still isn't. And for that reason i was considered a little bit spiritually limited. And very suspect.

189
00:22:49,21 --> 00:22:58,32
And certainly not a. Accorded much credibility in the community. So that got a bit worse with agenda china.

190
00:22:58,32 --> 00:23:03,77
Because women tend not to have much credibility on other. Particular it comes to cost. And things like that that.

191
00:23:03,77 --> 00:23:14,76
Men use as a get props. Because we're in. Them and. It's very male dominated. It tends to involve.

192
00:23:14,76 --> 00:23:24,81
My league is very heavily and. It's considered as. Mad and lacking in credibility anyway. Because people.

193
00:23:24,81 --> 00:23:30,77
Almost worship. Minds palak minds water. The utility authority.

194
00:23:30,77 --> 00:23:37,42
Is very close to the image of miles already and in our culture.

195
00:23:37,42 --> 00:23:42,12
And anyone who doesn't believe in those things has got to be a minute. I mean to peddle suffered a lot of this.

196
00:23:42,88 --> 00:23:48,5
He was considered an impractical. People sort of. People actually accept him quite well.

197
00:23:48,5 --> 00:23:54,62
Because he's so obviously eccentric. That. It's not a threat that he disagrees with them.

198
00:23:54,62 --> 00:24:00,82
So in that way he was much more successful at putting his message across than me who was but more of a sort of a.

199
00:24:00,82 --> 00:24:03,16
At the gnawing revolutionist.

200
00:24:03,16 --> 00:24:09,58
All saying this is morally wrong and stupid the why things are done with he wouldn't be nearly second front.

201
00:24:10,07 --> 00:24:15,8
They could see rick sipadan pedals having. Silly ideas like that one should could pedal.

202
00:24:15,8 --> 00:24:18,21
To write pal to run a television set.

203
00:24:18,21 --> 00:24:25,63
People can laugh at it people can treat him as a joke and for that reason he's not as confronting. All those much.

204
00:24:25,63 --> 00:24:36,22
Less tech flossing people didn't want to hear what i had to tell them. So i was had this credibility problem.

205
00:24:36,22 --> 00:24:45,48
As you will see. I've learned about. A few things. I've become very cynical about women's motivation. In love a face.

206
00:24:46,73 --> 00:24:50,73
But then i also don't hold it against them. I think that.

207
00:24:50,73 --> 00:24:55,77
It just means a very different thing to a woman and man to be in love.

208
00:24:55,77 --> 00:25:00,05
And i think the noisy vaadia is that there's no difference between the sexes.

209
00:25:01,07 --> 00:25:05,2
That was around in the sixty's and seventy's it's been proved wrong.

210
00:25:05,2 --> 00:25:21,94
Is an enormous difference between the sexes in lots of things. Well yes i know women are coming from.

211
00:25:21,94 --> 00:25:30,88
And i also know a lot more about what women are coming from too because i've become one in many wise. Most.

212
00:25:33,73 --> 00:25:48,66
Most of all was exclusively. Changed. Sexual part in this will is gender and that is most people died. You know.

213
00:25:51,69 --> 00:26:11,14
You know. In the history of tangible. It was an amazing social experiment. And it's still going on and. I think.

214
00:26:11,14 --> 00:26:15,92
Money is the key thing which. Now. Turns out to be central to the whole issue.

215
00:26:18,08 --> 00:26:26,28
Incredible damage was done to our coalition as a community by. Money. As in drug money.

216
00:26:26,28 --> 00:26:32,96
And in social security money was paid. In the why which could be most destructive. To community spirit.

217
00:26:33,51 --> 00:26:39,88
A little bit vicious about the department of social insecurity on that one. Why in which they headed up the money.

218
00:26:39,88 --> 00:26:47,07
Was almost obviously designed to destroy any community based movement. It was given to individuals.

219
00:26:47,07 --> 00:26:58,34
On behalf of their kids. It was given to women were paid to leave maine. As one of the effect of the white structure.

220
00:26:58,34 --> 00:27:08,8
You were paid to scam. You only paid if you lost. And you got. Continually. Kept in a state of paranoia.

221
00:27:09,35 --> 00:27:12,1
Random an unreasonable cut offs.

222
00:27:12,1 --> 00:27:17,46
It was a lack of any long range contracting about the payment of social security so that people didn't use it

223
00:27:17,46 --> 00:27:20,16
efficiently. And couldn't use it efficiently.

224
00:27:20,16 --> 00:27:26,44
And it maintained a sort of a live from die to die my life style which is absolute death. In any plain community.

225
00:27:26,44 --> 00:27:32,49
Because nearly everything which is productive has got to be kept going over a long period.

226
00:27:32,49 --> 00:27:42,21
So money was very destructive. The effect of the drug itself was destructive. Lots of people became alcoholics and.

227
00:27:42,21 --> 00:27:47,59
Heavy dope smokers. And i think that through lots of. Psychiatric of the times that.

228
00:27:47,59 --> 00:27:55,01
Heavy use of marijuana which is not being fully admitted. I think at the very least. It encourages different psychosis.

229
00:27:56,32 --> 00:27:59,39
Paranoia forgetfulness and laziness are obvious.

230
00:27:59,39 --> 00:28:06,39
But i think this deeper things than that to like this is the talk of schizophrenia that people get

231
00:28:06,39 --> 00:28:19,72
and i've been smoking a long time. Children. Is the other enormous factor. You can't underestimate how much.

232
00:28:19,72 --> 00:28:27,75
Children here. Partly because of living in such a close situation an extended family. Had enormous power.

233
00:28:27,75 --> 00:28:33,43
Outside society especially constructed to protect people from children put in schools.

234
00:28:33,43 --> 00:28:41,24
That they're bombarded with media. And there are the rules. And authorities about how they meant to be treated.

235
00:28:42,14 --> 00:28:50,00
He is there are no rules and. Justice in the politics. The people the latticed voices tend to get the most site.

236
00:28:51,1 --> 00:28:56,55
Children because i like a lot of noise. Tend to totally dominate was the tao and the dog.

237
00:28:56,55 --> 00:29:02,02
Many family groups were totally dominated by the needs of the children and.

238
00:29:02,02 --> 00:29:09,19
I think to the children side destruction insane. Civil cases. So the children. Get brought up. Totally spoilt.

239
00:29:09,19 --> 00:29:10,27
Self indulged.

240
00:29:10,27 --> 00:29:15,96
By the time that they take in the smoking dope all the time the twelve that died peddling heroin on the street.

241
00:29:15,96 --> 00:29:24,33
And that's why a lot of our children have gone. It's just too easy. Now if this is on constructive behavior.

242
00:29:26,2 --> 00:29:39,01
Would you say you know i have no idea. I consider myself a genuine small liberal but also a moralist.

243
00:29:39,01 --> 00:29:44,32
In that i think you haven't got a right to take what you can get. You've got a.

244
00:29:44,32 --> 00:29:53,94
An obligation to a community at least as much as yourself and lots of people that are totally selfish.

245
00:29:53,94 --> 00:29:58,77
And you know this is going to be a balance between the rights of the individual in the community. It's.

246
00:29:58,77 --> 00:30:08,55
It's as a very obvious statement it's also a fundamental. What about the challenges. You know. When you sit in this.

247
00:30:08,55 --> 00:30:21,34
Now. You know. You know. Things. Yes. Gradually the conventional services.

248
00:30:21,34 --> 00:30:25,16
Are becoming more expensive than not being subsidized as much by government.

249
00:30:25,16 --> 00:30:29,77
And then some much in the way of compulsory can. Consumption.

250
00:30:29,77 --> 00:30:33,35
Because so much of western culture us is compulsory can consumption.

251
00:30:33,57 --> 00:30:39,41
People don't even know how much that consuming half the time. Like starting to at least measure.

252
00:30:39,41 --> 00:30:42,72
Water rights in lismore. And you pay more if you use more water.

253
00:30:42,72 --> 00:30:50,5
I mean that radical ideas on me just now appeared in lismore. There's a funny attitude towards. Services rights.

254
00:30:50,5 --> 00:30:54,62
That you have for being a. What anglo-saxon process.

255
00:30:54,62 --> 00:31:03,03
Was considered the right to consume the world's resources on the very modest one. So that feeling's coming in.

256
00:31:03,03 --> 00:31:05,76
Also appropriate technology is getting a lot cheaper.

257
00:31:05,76 --> 00:31:10,94
And thanks to people are growing up our company is getting more valuable service to backed.

258
00:31:10,94 --> 00:31:18,52
All of those things that consumers want. Solar panels for example of consistently been getting better and cheaper.

259
00:31:19,09 --> 00:31:23,94
So that now you can actually run a remote house on solar panels. If you're careful.

260
00:31:24,31 --> 00:31:30,58
I think the biggest success this particular property has had with energy and. Impact is that.

261
00:31:30,58 --> 00:31:32,41
It's not so much to have done anything different.
